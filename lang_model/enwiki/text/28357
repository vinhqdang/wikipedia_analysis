'''Oestrogens''' or '''estrogens''' (spellings in [[British English]] and [[American English]] usage respectively), are a group of compounds named for their importance in both [[menstrual cycle|menstrual]] and [[estrous cycle|estrous]] reproductive cycles. They are the primary female [[sex hormone]]s. Natural estrogens are [[steroid hormone]]s, while some synthetic ones are non-steroidal. The name comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{lang|grc|<U+03BF><U+1F36><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2>}}'' (oistros), literally meaning "gadfly" but figuratively sexual passion or desire,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=oistros&la=greek|title=Greek Word Study Tool: oistros|publisher=[[Perseus Project|Perseus Digital Library]]|accessdate=2011-12-28}}</ref> and the suffix ''[[wikt:-gen|-gen]]'', meaning "producer of".

Estrogens are used as part of some [[combined oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptives]], in estrogen replacement therapy for [[postmenopausal]] women, and in [[Hormone replacement therapy (male-to-female)|hormone replacement therapy]] for [[trans women]].

Like all steroid hormones, estrogens readily [[diffusion|diffuse]] across the [[cell membrane]].

==Types==

===Steroidal===
The three major naturally occurring estrogens in women are [[estrone]] (E1), [[estradiol]] (E2), and [[estriol]] (E3). Estradiol  is the predominant estrogen during reproductive years both in terms of absolute serum levels as well as in terms of estrogenic activity.  During [[menopause]], estrone is the predominant circulating estrogen and during pregnancy estriol is the predominant circulating estrogen in terms of serum levels.  Though estriol is the most plentiful of the three estrogens it is also the weakest, whereas estradiol is the strongest with a potency of approximately 80 times that of estriol.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Thus, estradiol is the most important estrogen in non-pregnant females who are between the [[menarche]] and menopause stages of life. However, during [[pregnancy]] this role shifts to estriol, and in postmenopausal women estrone becomes the primary form of estrogen in the body. Another type of estrogen called [[estetrol]] (E4) is produced only during pregnancy. All of the different forms of estrogen are synthesized from [[androgen]]s, specifically [[testosterone]] and [[androstenedione]], by the [[enzyme]] [[aromatase]].

[[Premarin]], a commonly prescribed estrogenic drug produced from the urine of pregnant [[mare]]s, contains the steroidal estrogens [[equilin]] and [[equilenin]]. There are estradiol skin patches such as Estraderm (the original brand, introduced in the late 1980s) that offer a completely natural alternative.

[[File:Estradiol during menstrual cycle.png|thumb|350px|[[Reference ranges for blood tests|Reference ranges for the blood content]] of estradiol, the primary type of estrogen, during the [[menstrual cycle]].<ref>References and further description of values are given in image page in Wikimedia Commons at [[Commons:File:Estradiol during menstrual cycle.png]].</ref>]]

===Nonsteroidal===
A range of synthetic and natural substances have been identified that also possess estrogenic activity.<ref name="pmid11258977">{{cite journal | author = Fang H, Tong W, Shi LM, Blair R, Perkins R, Branham W, Hass BS, Xie Q, Dial SL, Moland CL, Sheehan DM | title = Structure-activity relationships for a large diverse set of natural, synthetic, and environmental estrogens | journal = Chem.

* Synthetic substances of this kind are known as [[xenoestrogen]]s.
* Plant products with estrogenic activity are called [[phytoestrogen]]s.
* Those produced by fungi are known as [[mycoestrogens]].

Unlike estrogens produced by mammals, these substances are not necessarily [[steroids]].

===Type in common reference===

Although scientifically there are various estrogens, the word "estrogen" in typical general conversation is usually used in the singular (making it sound as if there were only one kind of estrogen). Such [[usage]] refers specifically to the steroidal estrogen estradiol (E2). This is analogous to how "alcohol" in general conversation refers specifically (although implicitly) to [[ethanol]]. This explains why "estrogen" is generally said to have its highest levels in females of reproductive age, which is true of estradiol (E2), as explained above, although not of all other estrogens.

== Biosynthesis ==
[[File:Steroidogenesis.svg|thumb|right|450px|[[Steroidogenesis]], showing estrogens at bottom right as in pink triangle.]]

Estrogens, in females, are produced primarily by the [[ovary|ovaries]], and during pregnancy, the [[placenta]]. [[Follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) stimulates the ovarian production of estrogens by the [[granulosa cell]]s of the [[ovarian follicle]]s and [[corpus luteum|corpora lutea]]. Some estrogens are also produced in smaller amounts by other tissues such as the [[liver]], [[adrenal gland]]s, and the [[breast]]s. These secondary sources of estrogens are especially important in postmenopausal women. [[Adipocyte|Fat cell]]s produce estrogen as well.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nelson LR, Bulun SE |title=Estrogen production and action |journal=J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. |volume=45 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=S116<U+2013>24 |year=2001 |month=September |pmid=11511861 |doi= 10.1067/mjd.2001.117432|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11511861|accessdate=Jan 4, 2009}}</ref>

In females, synthesis of estrogens starts in [[theca interna]] cells in the ovary, by the synthesis of [[androstenedione]] from [[cholesterol]]. Androstenedione is a substance of weak androgenic activity which serves predominantly as a [[precursor (biochemistry)|precursor]] for more potent androgens such as testosterone as well as estrogen. This compound crosses the [[basal membrane]] into the surrounding granulosa cells, where it is converted either immediately into estrone, or into testosterone and then estradiol in an additional step. The conversion of androstenedione to testosterone is catalyzed by [[17<U+03B2>-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] (17<U+03B2>-HSD), whereas the conversion of androstenedione and testosterone into estrone and estradiol, respectively is catalyzed by aromatase, enzymes which are both expressed in granulosa cells. In contrast, granulosa cells lack [[17<U+03B1>-hydroxylase]] and [[17,20-lyase]], whereas theca cells express these enzymes and 17<U+03B2>-HSD but lack aromatase. Hence, both granulosa and theca cells are essential for the production of estrogen in the ovaries.

Estrogen levels vary through the [[menstrual cycle]], with levels highest near the end of the [[follicular phase]] just before [[ovulation]].

== Function ==
{{refimprove|date=December 2011}}
The actions of estrogen are mediated by the [[estrogen receptor]] (ER), a dimeric nuclear protein that binds to DNA and controls gene expression. Like other steroid hormones, estrogen enters passively into the cell where it binds to and activates the estrogen receptor. The estrogen:ER complex binds to specific DNA sequences called a [[hormone response element]] to activate the transcription of target genes (in a study using an estrogen-dependent breast cancer cell line as model, 89 such genes were identified).<ref>Lin, C.-Y. et al. 2004. Discovery of estrogen receptor alpha target genes and response elements in breast tumor cells" ''Genome Biol'' 5(9) R66. doi:10.1186/gb-2004-5-9-r66 PMID- 15345050</ref> Since estrogen enters all cells, its actions are dependent on the presence of the ER in the cell. The ER is expressed in specific tissues including the ovary, uterus and breast.

While estrogens are present in both [[man|men]] and [[woman|women]], they are usually present at significantly higher levels in women of reproductive age. They promote the development of female [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s, such as [[breasts]], and are also involved in the thickening of the [[endometrium]] and other aspects of regulating the menstrual cycle. In males, estrogen regulates certain functions of the [[reproductive system]] important to the maturation of [[sperm]]<ref name="pmid9393999">{{cite journal | author = Hess RA, Bunick D, Lee KH, Bahr J, Taylor JA, Korach KS, Lubahn DB | title = A role for estrogens in the male reproductive system | journal = Nature | volume = 390 | issue = 6659 | pages = 447<U+2013>8 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9393999 | doi = 10.1038/37352 }}</ref><ref name="titleScience News Online (12/6/97): Estrogens Emerging Manly Alter Ego">{{cite web | url = http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/sn_arc97/12_6_97/fob1.htm | title = Science News Online (12/6/97): Estrogen's Emerging Manly Alter Ego | accessdate = 2008-03-04 | author = J.

== Medical applications ==

=== Oral contraceptives ===

Since estrogen circulating in the blood can [[negative feedback|negatively feed-back]] to reduce circulating levels of [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]] and [[luteinizing hormone|LH]], most [[oral contraceptives]] contain a synthetic estrogen, along with a synthetic [[progestin]].  Even in men, the major hormone involved in LH feedback is [[estradiol]], not [[testosterone]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

=== Hormone replacement therapy ===
{{Main|hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|l1=Hormone replacement therapy}}

Estrogen and other hormones are given to postmenopausal women in order to prevent [[osteoporosis]] as well as treat the symptoms of menopause such as hot flushes, vaginal dryness, urinary stress incontinence, chilly sensations, dizziness, fatigue, irritability, and sweating.  Fractures of the spine, wrist, and hips decrease by 50<U+2013>70% and spinal bone density increases by ~5% in those women treated with estrogen within 3 years of the onset of menopause and for 5<U+2013>10 years thereafter.

Before the specific dangers of conjugated equine estrogens were well understood, standard therapy was 0.625&nbsp;mg/day of conjugated equine estrogens (such as Premarin). There are, however, risks associated with conjugated equine estrogen therapy.  Among the older postmenopausal women studied as part of the [[Women's Health Initiative]] (WHI), an orally administered conjugated equine estrogen supplement was found to be associated with an increased risk of dangerous [[blood clotting]]. The WHI studies used one type of estrogen supplement, a high oral dose of conjugated equine estrogens ([[Premarin]] alone and with medroxyprogesterone acetate as ''PremPro'').<ref name="titleNIH - Menopausal Hormone Therapy Information">{{cite web | url = http://www.nih.gov/PHTindex.htm | title = NIH <U+2013> Menopausal Hormone Therapy Information | accessdate = 2008-03-04 | date = August 27, 2007 | publisher = National Institutes of Health | quote = }}</ref>

In a study by the NIH, esterified estrogens were not proven to pose the same risks to health as conjugated equine estrogens.  [[hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|Hormone replacement therapy]] has favorable effects on serum cholesterol levels, and when initiated immediately upon menopause may reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease, although this hypothesis has yet to be tested in randomized trials. Estrogen appears to have a protector effect on atherosclerosis: it lowers LDL and triglycerides, it raises HDL levels and has endothelial vasodilatation properties plus an anti-inflammatory component.

Research is underway to determine if risks of estrogen supplement use are the same for all methods of delivery. In particular, estrogen applied [[topical]]ly may have a different spectrum of side-effects than when administered orally,<ref name="pmid16396517">{{cite journal | author = Menon DV, Vongpatanasin W | title = Effects of transdermal estrogen replacement therapy on cardiovascular risk factors | journal = Treat Endocrinol | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 37<U+2013>51 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16396517| doi = 10.2165/00024677-200605010-00005  }}</ref> and transdermal estrogens do not affect clotting as they are absorbed directly into the systemic circulation, avoiding first-pass metabolism in the liver. This route of administration is thus preferred in women with a history of [[thrombo-embolic disease]].

Estrogen is also used in the therapy of vaginal atrophy, hypoestrogenism (as a result of hypogonadism, castration, or primary ovarian failure), amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, and oligomenorrhea.  Estrogens can also be used to suppress [[lactation]] after child birth.

=== Breast cancer ===

About 80% of breast cancers, once established, rely on supplies of the hormone estrogen to grow: they are known as hormone-sensitive or hormone-receptor-positive cancers. Suppression of production of estrogen in the body is a treatment for these cancers.

Most recently, estrogen has been used in experimental research as a way to treat patients suffering from [[bulimia nervosa]], in addition to [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], which is the established standard for treatment in bulimia cases.

=== Health risks and warning labels ===

Hyperestrogenemia (elevated levels of estrogen) may be a result of exogenous administration of estrogen or estrogen-like substances, or may be a result of physiologic conditions such as pregnancy. Any of these causes is linked with an increase in the risk of [[thrombosis]].<ref name="Kumar">{{cite book | chapter = 4 | author = Mitchell RS, Kumar v, Robbins SL, Abbas AK, Fausto N | title = Robbins basic pathology | publisher = Saunders/Elsevier | edition = 8th | year = 2007 | isbn = 1-4160-2973-7 }}</ref>

The estrogen-alone substudy of the WHI reported an increased risk of stroke and [[deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT) in postmenopausal women 50 years of age or older and an increased risk of [[dementia]] in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older using 0.625&nbsp;mg of Premarin conjugated equine estrogens (CEE). The estrogen-plus-progestin substudy of the WHI reported an increased risk of [[myocardial infarction]], stroke, invasive breast cancer, [[pulmonary emboli]] and DVT in postmenopausal women 50 years of age or older and an increased risk of dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older using PremPro, which is 0.625&nbsp;mg of CEE with 2.5&nbsp;mg of the progestin [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]] (MPA).<ref name=fdanewlabel>{{cite web |author=FDA |title=FDA Approves New Labels for Estrogen and Estrogen with Progestin Therapies for Postmenopausal Women Following Review of Women's Health Initiative Data |url=http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2003/NEW00863.html  |date=January 8, 2003|accessdate=2006-10-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071221093608/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2003/NEW00863.html |archivedate = December 21, 2007}}</ref><ref name="Times">{{cite web | author = Kolata G | title = F.D.A.

The labeling of estrogen-only products in the U.S. includes a [[black box warning|boxed warning]] that unopposed estrogen (without [[progestogen]]) therapy increases the risk of [[endometrial cancer]]. Based on a review of data from the WHI, on January 8, 2003 the FDA changed the labeling of all estrogen and estrogen with progestin products for use by postmenopausal women to include a new boxed warning about cardiovascular and other risks.

== Cosmetics ==

Some hair [[shampoo]]s on the market include estrogens and placental extracts; others contain [[phytoestrogens]]. There are case reports of young children developing breasts after exposure to these shampoos.<ref>{{Cite news  | author = Sanghavi DM  | title=Preschool Puberty, and a Search for the Causes  | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = 2006-10-17  | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/17/science/17puberty.html |accessdate=2008-06-04 }}</ref>
On September 9, 1993, the FDA determined that not all topically applied hormone-containing drug products for [[over-the-counter drug|OTC]] human use are [[generally recognized as safe and effective]] and are misbranded. An accompanying proposed rule deals with cosmetics, concluding that any use of natural estrogens in a cosmetic product makes the product an unapproved new drug and that any cosmetic using the term "hormone" in the text of its labeling or in its ingredient statement makes an implied drug claim, subjecting such a product to regulatory action.<ref name="FDA cosmetics">{{cite web |author=FDA | date=1995, February |title=Products containing estrogenic hormones, placental extract or vitamins |work=Guide to Inspections of Cosmetic Product Manufacturers |url=http://www.fda.gov/ora/inspect_ref/igs/cosmet.html  |accessdate=2006-10-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071014014542/http://www.fda.gov/ora/inspect_ref/igs/cosmet.html |archivedate = October 14, 2007}}</ref>

In addition to being considered misbranded drugs, products claiming to contain placental extract may also be deemed to be misbranded cosmetics if the extract has been prepared from placentas from which the hormones and other biologically active substances have been removed and the extracted substance consists principally of protein. The FDA recommends that this substance be identified by a name other than "placental extract" and describing its composition more accurately because consumers associate the name "placental extract" with a therapeutic use of some biological activity.<ref name="FDA cosmetics"/>

== History ==

In 1929 [[Adolf Butenandt]] and [[Edward Adelbert Doisy]] independently isolated and determined the structure of estrogen.<ref name="pmid15940278">{{cite journal | author = Tata JR | title = One hundred years of hormones | journal = EMBO Reports | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 490<U+2013>6 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15940278 | doi = 10.1038/sj.embor.7400444 | pmc = 1369102 }}</ref> Thereafter, the market for hormonal drug research opened up.

The "first orally effective estrogen", Emmenin, derived from the late-pregnancy urine of Canadian women, was introduced in 1930 by Collip and Ayerst Laboratories.  Estrogens are not water-soluble and cannot be given orally, but the urine was found to contain estriol [[glucuronide]] which is water soluble and becomes active in the body after [[hydrolysis]].

Scientists continued to search for new sources of estrogen because of concerns associated with the practicality of introducing the drug into the market. At the same time, a German pharmaceutical drug company, formulated a similar product as Emmenin that was introduced to German women to treat menopausal symptoms.

In 1938, British scientists obtained a patent on a newly formulated nonsteroidal estrogen, [[diethylstilbestrol]] (DES), that was cheaper and more powerful than the previously manufactured estrogens. Soon after, concerns over the side effects of DES were raised in scientific journals while the drug manufacturers came together to lobby for governmental approval of DES. It was only until 1941 when estrogen therapy was finally approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of menopausal symptoms.<ref>{{cite web | author=Rothenberg, Carla J. | title= The Rise and Fall of Estrogen Therapy: The History of HRT |date=April 25, 2005 | url= http://leda.law.harvard.edu/leda/data/711/Rothenberg05.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2006-10-27 }}</ref>

== Environmental effects ==

Estrogens are among the wide range of endocrine-disrupting compounds ([[endocrine disruptor|EDCs]]) because they have high estrogenic potency.
