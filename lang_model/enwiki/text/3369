'''Andr<U+00E9> Kert<U+00E9>sz''' ([[July 2]], [[1894]] <U+2013> [[September 28]], [[1985]]) born '''Andor Kert<U+00E9>sz''', was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born [[photography|photographer]] distinguished by his photographic [[composition (visual arts)|composition]] and by his early efforts in developing the [[photo essay]]. In the early years of his lengthy career, his then-unorthodox camera angles, and his unwillingness to compromise his personal photographic style, prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Even towards the end of his life, Kert<U+00E9>sz did not feel he had gained worldwide recognition. The first photographer to have an exposition devoted to his work, he is recognized as one of the seminal figures of [[photojournalism]], if not photography as a whole.<ref name="Of Paris & New York">{{cite book|last=Naef| first=Weston J.| coauthors=Sandra S Phillips & David Travis|title=Andr<U+00E9> Kert<U+00E9>sz: Of Paris and New York |year=1985 |location= Chicago |publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago| isbn=0-500-54106-X| pages=7<U+2013>124}}</ref><ref name="Diary of Light">{{cite book |last=Capa |first=C.| coauthors=Hal Hinson,  Susan Harder & Hiroji Kubota |title=Andr<U+00E9> Kert<U+00E9>sz: Diary of Light 1912<U+2013>1985 |year=1987 |publisher=Aperture Books |location=New York |isbn=0-89381-256-0| pages=198<U+2013>206}}</ref>

Dedicated by his family to work as a stock broker, Kert<U+00E9>sz was an [[autodidact]] and his early work was mostly published in magazines. This would continue until much later in his life when he ceased to accept commissions. He served briefly in [[WWI]] and began to form dreams to move to Paris, which he realised in 1925, against the wishes of his family. There he was involved with the artistic melting pot of immigrates and the dadaist movement, and achieved critical and commercial success. The imminent threat of [[WWII]] pushed him to immigrate again to the United States, where he had a more difficult life and needed to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work. He would take offense with several editors that he felt did not recognize his work. In the 40s and 50s he stopped working for magazines and began achieved greater international success. Despite the numerous and awards he collected over the years, he still felt unrecognized, a sentiment which did not change even into his death. His career is general divided into four periods based on where his work was most prominent at these times. They are called the Hungarian period, the French period, the American period and, towards the end of his life, the International period.

==Early life==
Andor Kert<U+00E9>sz was born [[July 2]], [[1894]] in [[Budapest]] to the middle-class family of Lip<U+00F3>t Kert<U+00E9>sz, a bookseller, and his wife, Ernesztin Hoffmann.<ref name="Photobook">{{cite book |last=Jeffrey |first=I.| coauthors=|title=The Photography Book|year=1997 |publisher=Phaidon Press Ltd|location=|isbn=0-714-83634-6| pages=240}}</ref> Kert<U+00E9>sz, known as "Bandi" to his friends, was the middle child of three sons. When Lip<U+00F3>t died in 1908 from [[tuberculosis]], Ernesztin was left widowed and without a source of income to care for her three children, Andor, Imre and Jen<U+0151>. Fortunately, Ernesztin's brother, Lip<U+00F3>t Hoffmann, provided for Kert<U+00E9>sz and his brothers and acted much like a father to them. The family soon moved to Lip<U+00F3>t's country property in [[Szigetbecse]], where Kert<U+00E9>sz was exposed to a leisurely pace of life and pastoral setting that would shape his later career path.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work">{{cite book |last=Borhan |first=Pierre |title=Andr<U+00E9> Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work |year=2000 |publisher=Bulfinch Press |location=Boston |isbn=0-8212-2648-7| pages=8-32}}</ref><ref name="Lifetime of photography">{{cite book |last=Corkin |first=Jane| coauthors=B.

Lip<U+00F3>t paid for Kert<U+00E9>sz's business classes at the Academy of Commerce until his 1912 graduation, and then procured Kert<U+00E9>sz's hiring at the [[stock exchange]] soon after.<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> Unlike his brother Imre, who worked at the exchange in Budapest until his death in 1957, Kert<U+00E9>sz had little interest in the career. He was instead drawn to illustrated [[magazine]]s and to activities like fishing and swimming in the [[Danube]] near his uncle's property. Kert<U+00E9>sz's first encounters with magazine photography where what first persuaded him to dream of becoming a photographer. He was also influenced by certain paintings by [[Lajos Tihanyi]] and Gyula Zilzer, as well as by poetry.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/><ref name="Aperture">{{cite book |last=K<U+00F6>nemann|first=| coauthors=|title=Aperture Masters of Photography: Andr<U+00E9> Kert<U+00E9>sz|year=1997 |publisher=Aperture Foundation Inc |location=New York |isbn=3-895-08611-8| pages=5<U+2013>22, 86<U+2013>94}}</ref>

==Hungarian period==
Kert<U+00E9>sz bought his first camera (an [[ICA]] box camera) in 1912, as soon as he had earned enough money,<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/><ref name="Aperture"/> despite his family's protests to continue his career in business. In his free time away from work, he began taking photographs of the local peasants, gypsies and landscape of the surrounding [[Great Hungarian Plain|Hungarian Plains]] (the ''puszta''). His first photograph is believed to be "Sleeping Boy, Budapest, 1912",<ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/> although his photographs were not published until 1917, during WWI, while he was a member of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] army; they were first published in the magazine ''Erdekes Ujsag''.<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> Kert<U+00E9>sz taught himself how to use a camera and even as early as 1914 (for example, "Eugene, 1914") his distinctive and mature style was already evident.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Photobook"/><ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/><ref name="Aperture"/>

In 1914, at the age of 20, he was sent to the frontline, where he took photographs of life in the [[trench|trenches]] with a light-weight camera (a [[Goerz (company)|Goerz]] Tenax),<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> perfect for carrying around during combat. Unfortunately, most of these photographs were destroyed during the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungarian Revolution of 1919]]. He was wounded in 1915 by a bullet and his right arm was temporarily paralyzed. Kert<U+00E9>sz was sent to a military hospital in Budapest, but was later transferred to [[Esztergom]], where he continued to take photographs, including a [[self-portrait]] of himself for a competition in the magazine ''Borsszem Janko''.<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/><ref name="Aperture"/> Of this period of work, his arguably most famous piece was "Underwater Swimmer, Esztergom, 1917", the only surviving photograph of a series depicting a swimmer whose image is distorted by the water. This photograph sparked Kert<U+00E9>sz's interest in distortions that lead to his series of "Distortions" photographs during the early 1930s.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/><ref name="Lifetime of photography"/><ref name="Aperture"/>

Kert<U+00E9>sz remained off the frontline until peace returned to Europe in 1918, after which he reluctantly returned to the stock exchange.<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> However, he did meet his future wife Erzsebet Salomon (who changed her name to Elizabeth Saly) at the exchange, where they both worked, and began to pursue her romantically. During this period of work and throughout his whole career, Elizabeth would be a model for his photographs. Continuing to devote his spare time to photography, he took numerous photographs with his brother Jen<U+0151> as the subject. Still unsatisfied with his life at the stock exchange, Kert<U+00E9>sz left his career to try his hand at agricultural work and [[beekeeping]] during the early 1920s. This venture was short-lived due to the advent of political turmoil and communism in the countryside. Again returning to the stock exchange, he finally decided to leave Hungary altogether, primarily to escape his current life, but also to join one of France's photographic schools. Despite the allure of Paris, Kert<U+00E9>sz was eventually persuaded not to go by his mother for the time being. This dream of leaving Hungary would not be realised for many years to come, so in the meantime, he silently continued to work at the exchange and take photographs only in his spare time. In 1923, he was offered a silver medal by the Hungarian Amateur Photographer's Association for one of his photographs, but with the condition that he had to print the photograph in [[Bromoil Process|bromoil]]. Kert<U+00E9>sz refused and turned down the medal for a diploma from the association instead.<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> He was rewarded, however, when one of his photographs was used on the cover of the Hungarian news magazine ''Erdekes Ujs<U+00E1>g'' on its [[June 26]], [[1925]] issue. The magazine had already printed one of his photographs in its [[March 25]] [[1917]] issue, but this was the first time Kert<U+00E9>sz's pictures had ever been placed on a front cover. By that time, he had already made his decision and was determined to photograph the sites in Paris and use the city's artistic elements.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/><ref name="Aperture"/>

==French period==
[[Image:Kertesz The Fork.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The Fork'', or ''La Fourchette'', was taken in 1928 and is one of Kert<U+00E9>sz's most famous works from this period.<ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/>]]
Kert<U+00E9>sz emigrated to Paris in September 1925 against his mother's wishes, leaving her behind along with both his brothers, his wife and his uncle Lip<U+00F3>t, who died shortly thereafter.<ref name="Photobook"/> Jen<U+0151> also left Hungary to live in [[Argentina]], but Elizabeth remained until her husband was well established in Paris and could live together. Kert<U+00E9>sz became one of the many artists who had left the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] for another country, such as Fran<U+00E7>ois Kollar, [[Robert Capa]] and Emeric Feh<U+00E9>r, and was certainly not the only artist emigrating to Paris; [[Man Ray]], [[Germaine Krull]] (who also took part in exhibitions with Kert<U+00E9>sz) and [[Lucien Aigner]] all emigrated there during this period. In Paris he found critical and commercial success with magazine publications after doing commissioned work for several magazines across Europe from Germany to France to Italy to Great Britain. Kert<U+00E9>sz was the first photographer to have a one-man exhibition when Jan Slivinsky organised to have 30 of his photographs presented in 1927 at the gallery ''Sacre du Printemps Gallery''.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> Over the next years, Kert<U+00E9>sz would appear in many solo exhibitions and shows with other artists.<ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Lifetime of photography"/><ref name="Aperture"/> In one show at the Julien Levy Gallery in [[New York]] in 1932, the price of Kert<U+00E9>sz's [[Artist's proof|proofs]] was set at US$20, a large sum of money during the [[Great Depression]] of America.<ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/> 

Kert<U+00E9>sz changed his first name to Andr<U+00E9> soon after arriving in Paris, and would keep that name for the rest of his life. At that time, [[Dadaism]] was beginning to attract numerous photographers and was becoming a large movement amongst artists, especially in France. Kert<U+00E9>sz quickly became acquainted with the movement's members and one of them, Paul Derm<U+00E9>e, dubbed him "Brother Seer" and "Brother Seeing Eye" during Kert<U+00E9>sz's first solo exhibition in 1927; this was an allusion to a medieval monastery where all the monks were blind bar one. Kert<U+00E9>sz continued for the entirety of his time in Paris to contact and visit various other Hungarian photographers and artists, and would eventually star in exhibitions with some of them later in his life. Indeed, he enjoyed visiting many of his sculptor friends, and was impressed by the [[Cubism]] movement. In his spare time, he created portraits of, among others, painters [[Piet Mondrian]]<ref name="Lecia">{{cite book |last=Pasi |first=Alessandro |title=Leica: Witness To A Century |year=2003 |publisher=W.W. Norton |location=New York |isbn=0-393-05921-9| pages=54<U+2013>55}}</ref> and [[Marc Chagall]], writer [[Colette]],<ref name="Diary of Light"/> and film-maker [[Sergei Eisenstein]].<ref name="Diary of Light"/> In 1928, Kert<U+00E9>sz switched from the usage of cameras with plates and moved on to a [[Leica]], which he became accustomed to quickly.<ref name="Aperture"/><ref name="Lecia"/> This period of work was arguably one of his most productive, when he took photographs every day and had some of them published in magazines throughout the late 1920s, carefully dividing his time between commissioned work and his own personal photography.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> In 1930, Kert<U+00E9>sz was awarded a silver medal for services to photography at the ''Exposition Coloniale'' in Paris where he attended.<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> 

Kert<U+00E9>sz was published in Fench magazines such as ''[[Vu]]'' and ''Art et M<U+00E9>decine'',<ref name="Photobook"/> in which he made numerous covers.<ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> His greatest journalistic collaboration was with the French editor and publisher of ''Vu'', [[Lucien Vogel]], who ran his photographs without explanatory prose and let him report on various subjects. Kert<U+00E9>sz enjoyed travelling in and around Paris taking photographs on the varied subject Vogel set for him to capture. Kert<U+00E9>sz was commissioned to create one of his most famous series of works, the "Distortion" photographs, in 1933: a series of about 200 photographs of two nude, female  models in various poses with their reflections in a combination of distortion mirrors, similar to those found in a carnival's [[house of mirrors]]. In some cases the models, Najinskaya Verackhatz and Nadia Kasine, were so distorted that only certain limbs or features were visible in the mirror's reflection. Some of the images appeared in the [[March 2]] issue of the so-called "girly magazine" ''Le Sourire'' and later in the [[September 15]], [[1933]] issue of ''Arts et m<U+00E9>tiers graphiques''.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/> Kert<U+00E9>sz published the book ''Distortions'' later that year containing the photographs.<ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Aperture"/>

After his first book of photographs ''Enfants'' in 1933, which was dedicated to Elizabeth and his mother, who had died earlier that year, what followed was a series of other book publications.<ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Aperture"/> His next book, ''Paris'',  was published in 1934 and dedicated to his brothers Imre and Jen<U+0151>. ''Nos Amies les b<U+00EA>tes'' ("Our Friends the Animals") was released in 1936 and ''Les Cath<U+00E9>drales du vin'' ("The Cathedrals of Wine") in 1937.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/><ref name="Lifetime of photography"/>

Unknown to his family and indeed most people, Kert<U+00E9>sz had married a French portrait photographer by the name of Rosza Klein (although she used the name Rogi Andr<U+00E9>) in the late 1920s.<ref name="Diary of Light"/> The marriage was short-lived and he never spoke about it until his dying day, so as not to upset his wife Elizabeth. In 1930, he ventured back to Hungary to visit his family. After returning to Paris, Elizabeth followed him in 1931, despite firm opposition from her family, to be with the love of her life. Elizabeth and Andr<U+00E9> were never separated again. Despite his mother dying that same year, Kert<U+00E9>sz married Elizabeth on [[June 17]], [[1933]]. Following this, he is said to have spent increasingly less time with his artist and photographer friends to favor his new wife.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/><ref name="Aperture"/>

At the time of Kert<U+00E9>sz's marriage, the [[Nazi]] party was growing in power in Germany. This prompted the magazine industries to publish stories about political topics and many stopped publishing his work due to its neutral demeanor and unpolitical subject matter. From then on, Kert<U+00E9>sz received increasingly less commissioned work and, with Elizabeth's consent, made plans to move to New York to work at the Keystone agency owned by Erney Prince. So in 1936, amidst the threat of [[World War II]] and lack of work, Kert<U+00E9>sz and Elizabeth boarded the [[SS Washington|SS ''Washington'']] bound for [[Manhattan]].<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/><ref name="Lifetime of photography"/><ref name="Aperture"/>

==American period==
[[Image:Kertesz distortion 1933.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Distortion #49'', one of the images in the ''Distortion'' series Kert<U+00E9>sz took during 1933]]
Kert<U+00E9>sz arrived in New York with his wife on [[October 15]], [[1936]], intent on rekindling his inspiration and finding fame as a photographer in America.<ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Photobook"/> He and his wife lived out of the Beaux Arts Hotel in [[Greenwich Village]].<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> From his arrival, Kert<U+00E9>sz found life in America harder than he had imagined and thus started what he would refer to later in his life as the "absolute tragedy".<ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/> He was now deprived of his French artist friends and the people in America did not respond as kindly as in Paris when their picture was being taken. Soon after his arrival, Kert<U+00E9>sz approached [[Beaumont Newhall]], the [[Museum of Modern Art|Museum of Modern Art's]] photographic department director, who was readying a show entitled ''Photography 1839<U+2013>1937''.<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> But when Kert<U+00E9>sz offered Newhall some of his ''Distortions'' photographs to display, Newhall criticized them, which offended Kert<U+00E9>sz, who never forgave him. Despite this, Newhall took the photographs and displayed them;<ref name="Aperture"/> Kert<U+00E9>sz went on to star in his own solo December 1937 exhibition at the PM Gallery. The final nail in the coffin for Kert<U+00E9>sz was when the Keystone agency, who had offered him offsite work which would take him to various locations for his photojournalism, instead made him spend the entirety of his work day in the company's studio.<ref name="Diary of Light"/> Kert<U+00E9>sz tried to return to France to visit, but had no money, and when he had saved enough, World War II had broken out, making travel to France nearly impossible. His struggles with English only compounded his problems. He had coped with his inability to speak French while in France, but in New York, where he already felt like an outsider, the language barrier was debilitating.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/>

Growing more and more frustrated with the city, Kert<U+00E9>sz left Keystone to look for other work after his boss Erney Prince left the company in 1937. He was commissioned by the magazine ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' for an article on the [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] department store in their April 1937 issue.<ref name="Photobook"/> The magazine continued to work with him in further issues and Kert<U+00E9>sz took commissions from ''[[Town & Country (magazine)|Town and Country]]'' to supplement his income. He was invited by ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' to work for the magazine,<ref name="Photobook"/> but turned the offer down, fearing he could not enthusiastically photograph a set studio series as seen in the fashion world. He instead opted to work for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, starting with a piece called ''The Tugboat''. However, despite orders, he photographed more than just the subject matter of tugboats, instead photographing the whole harbour and its going ons. Due to this, ''Life'' refused to publish the photographs and Kert<U+00E9>sz was once again frustrated with the constriction of the city and its photographic industry.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/><ref name="Aperture"/>

In the [[October 25]], [[1938]] issue of ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'', the magazine finally printed a series of photographs called ''A Fireman Goes to School''; but credited them to Erney Prince, Kert<U+00E9>sz's former boss.<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> Infuriated, Kert<U+00E9>sz considered never working with illustrated magazines ever again. He did however appear in the magazine ''[[Coronet (magazine)|Coronet]]'' in 1937, but was snubbed in 1939 when the magazine published a special issue containing a selection of ''Coronet's'' "Most memorable photographs", none of which were his. He later severed all ties to the magazine and its editor [[Arnold Gingrich]]. This was repeated in the June 1941 issue of ''Vogue'', which was dedicated to photography in honour of [[Cond<U+00E9> Montrose Nast]], head of [[Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publications|Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publishing]]. Despite having contributed to more than 30 commissioned photo essays and articles in both ''Vogue'' and ''House and Garden'', Kert<U+00E9>sz was omitted from the list of photographers. In the same year, since he and Elizabeth carried Hungarian passports, Kert<U+00E9>sz was designated an enemy alien due to World War II and was not permitted to photograph outside or anything to do with national security,<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> and was later fingerprinted. Not wanting to be arrested or get in trouble with the police because Elizabeth had started a cosmetics company (''Cosmia Laboratories'') with a Hungarian friend, Kert<U+00E9>sz ceased to do commissioned work and disappeared from all photographic work for three years.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/><ref name="Aperture"/>

Elizabeth became a US citizen on [[January 20]], [[1944]], followed on [[February 3]] by her husband.<ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> Despite fierce competition from other photographers such as [[Irving Penn]], Kert<U+00E9>sz thrust himself back into commissioned work. Although he was left out of the 63 photographers listed in ''Vogue's'' "photographic genealogical tree", listing important photographers of the era, he was hired for Christmas commission work by ''House and Garden'', which he had worked for before. He was offered a position teaching photography to students at the [[IIT Institute of Design|New Bauhaus - American School of Design]] in June 1944 by its director [[L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3> Moholy-Nagy]]. Despite the honour, he turned the offer down. He also released a new photographic book, ''Day of Paris'' in 1945, comprised of photographs taken just before he left Europe. The book gained critical success. With his wife's cosmetic business booming, Kert<U+00E9>sz agreed when the new art director of ''House and Garden'' offered him a long-term, exclusive contract in 1946. Although the contract restricted his editorial abilities and forced him to spend many hours in the studio, the pay of at least US$10,000 per annum was satisfactory and all photographic negatives would be returned to him within six months.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/><ref name="Lifetime of photography"/><ref name="Aperture"/>

Although his subject range was limited, Kert<U+00E9>sz was sent to many famous homes and places, and indeed overseas, passing through England as well as Budapest and Paris once more. During that 1945 to 1962 period at ''House and Garden'', more than 3,000 of his photographs were published in the magazine and he created a reputation for himself in the industry. However, Kert<U+00E9>sz made few personal pieces during this time and was starved for artistic creativity.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/>

==Later life and death==
In 1946, Kert<U+00E9>sz was again placed in a solo exhibition at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], which was comprised mainly of photographs from his ''Day of Paris'' series. Kert<U+00E9>sz often refers to this as one of his greatest moments in America.<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> Afterward however, it was not until 1962 that his photographs were in a public display again, when they were shown at [[Long Island University]]. During this dormant period spent working for ''House and Garden'' he was insulted once again when his work did not appear in [[Edward Steichen]]'s famous ''[[The Family of Man]]'' show at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in 1955. Thus towards the end of 1961, he broke his contract to Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publishing after a minor dispute. Kert<U+00E9>sz, now feeling liberated from the confines of the magazine, thrust himself back into the international photographic scene. This later period of his life is often referred to as the "International period",<ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/> where he was able to gain worldwide recognition and held many exhibitions in many countries. He appeared in an exhibition at the ''IV Mostra Biennale Internazionale della Fotografia'' in [[Venice]] in 1963 after his 1962 exhibition and later appeared that same year at the [[Biblioth<U+00E8>que nationale de France]] in Paris. The gold medal he was awarded in Venice for his dedication to the photographic industry gave him a feeling of recognition he had never felt whilst working for ''House and Garden''. He later visited Argentina to see his brother Jen<U+0151>.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/><ref name="Lifetime of photography"/><ref name="Aperture"/>

During this period, Kert<U+00E9>sz experimented with colour photographs, but only produced a few of them. In 1964, soon after [[John Szarkowski]] became the photography director at the Museum of Modern Art, Kert<U+00E9>sz was featured in a solo show set up by Szarkowski.<ref name="Lifetime of photography"/> The show, and ultimately Kert<U+00E9>sz himself, were critically acclaimed and he was soon known within photographic circles as an important photographic figure, but still not quite at the level he had been hoping for all his life; he still believed that the world did not truly appreciate him and stood by this until his death. Kert<U+00E9>sz and Elizabeth moved to a 12th floor apartment near [[Washington Square Park, New York|Washington Square Park]] in 1952, where he took what were to be arguably the best photographs he had taken since his arrival in America; the series depicts a snow-covered Washington Square with numerous silhouettes and tracks and was taken using a [[telephoto lens]]. Kert<U+00E9>sz appeared in numerous exhibitions throughout the world in his later life, even into his early nineties. In 1965, due to his newfound success, Kert<U+00E9>sz was appointed as a member of the [[American Society of Magazine Photographers]] and was later awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in [[List of Guggenheim Fellowships awarded in 1974|1974]]. In the years to come, in addition to appearing in numerous exhibitions, Kert<U+00E9>sz also received a number of awards: in 1974 he was made a Commander of the French [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]], in 1977 he received the Mayor's Award of Honor for Arts and Culture in New York, in 1980 the Medal of the City of Paris and the first Annual Award of the Association of International Photography Art Dealers in New York that same year. He received in 1981 an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from [[Bard College]] in New York, and again received the Mayor's Award of Honor for Arts and Culture that year. Kert<U+00E9>sz produced a number of new books during this period and also recovered some of the negatives he had left in France decades before.<ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/><ref name="Lifetime of photography"/><ref name="Aperture"/>

Despite his successes, Kert<U+00E9>sz still felt unrecognised as a photographer. His last years were spent travelling to various locations around the globe for his exhibitions, especially [[Japan]], and rekindling friendships with other artists. Elizabeth died in 1977 from cancer and was cremated. To cope with the loss, Kert<U+00E9>sz fell back on his new network of friends, often visiting them at night to talk. By this time, he was said to have learned basic English and often talked in what his friends called "Kert<U+00E9>szian", a strange mixture of Hungarian, English and French.<ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/> In 1979, the [[Polaroid Corporation]] gifted him with one of their new [[SX-70]], which he experimented with into the 1980s. Still growing in fame, Kert<U+00E9>sz was granted the National Grand Prize of Photography in Paris in 1982, as well as the 21st Annual George Washington Award from the American Hungarian Foundation the same year. To add to the numerous awards collected over his career, Kert<U+00E9>sz was later given an honorary Doctorate from the [[Royal College of Art]] in 1983; the title of Chevalier de la [[L<U+00E9>gion d'Honneur]] in Paris in 1983, which was presented along with an apartment for future visits to Paris; the Maine Photographic Workshop's first Annual Lifetime Achievement Award in 1984; the Californian Distinguished Career in Photography Award in 1985; first Annual Master of Photography Award that same year, presented by the [[International Centre of Photography]]; as well as a honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from [[Parsons The New School for Design|Parson's School of Design]] of the New School for Social Research. To add to the overwhelming amount of appreciation shown by the various institutions across the globe, the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art purchased 100 prints from him in 1984, the largest ever acquisition of photographs from a living artist by a museum.<ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Aperture"/>

Kert<U+00E9>sz died peacefully in his sleep at home on [[September 28]] [[1985]]; he was cremated and his ashes interred with his wife's.<ref name="Diary of Light"/><ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/><ref name="Aperture"/> During his photographic career which had spanned for more than 70 years, Kert<U+00E9>sz had been given numerous awards for his achievements in photography. He was the first photographer ever to have a one-man show and had appeared in countless exhibitions around the world. He had travelled across the globe from Hungary and had eventually found recognition towards the end of his life and certainly after his death and is now considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism and photo essay and if not photography as a whole.<ref name="Of Paris & New York"/><ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/>

==Critical evaluation==
Throughout most of his career, Kert<U+00E9>sz was depicted as the "unknown soldier" who worked behind the scenes of photography, yet was rarely cited for his work, even into his death in the 1980s.<ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/> Kert<U+00E9>sz thought himself unrecognised throughout his life, despite spending his life in the eternal search for acceptance and fame. Though Kert<U+00E9>sz received numerous awards for photography, he never felt both his style and work was accepted by critics and art audiences alike. Although, in 1927, he was the first photographer to have a solo exhibition, Kert<U+00E9>sz said that it was not until his 1946 exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago, that he first felt he received positive reviews on his work, and often cites this show as one of his finest moments in America. During his stay in America, he was cited as being an intimate artist, bringing the viewer into his work, even when the picture was that of subjects such as the intimidating New York City<ref name="NYT1">{{Citation| last =Thornton| first =Gene| title = Photography View; Andre Kertesz's Romance with Paris| newspaper =The New York Times| pages = Arts & Leisure, D32.| year =1976| date =Sunday, April 4| url =http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10A16FD3D551A708DDDAD0894DC405B868BF1D3}}</ref> and even his reproduced work printed after his death received good reviews; "Kertesz was above all a consistently fine photographer".<ref name="NYT2">{{Citation| last =Grundberg| first =Andy|title = Christmas Books '94; Photography| newspaper =The New York Times.| pages =| year =1994| date =December 4| url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02E2DA1630F937A35751C1A962958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2}}</ref> Kert<U+00E9>sz's work itself is often described as predominantly utilising light and even Kert<U+00E9>sz himself said that "I write with light".<ref name="Diary of Light2">Capa et ''al'', ''Diary of Light'', pp. inside cover.</ref> He was never considered to "comment" on his subjects, but rather capture them - this is often cited as why his work is often overlooked; he stuck to no polictal agenda and offered no deeper thought to his photographs other than the simplicity of life. With his art's intimate feeling and nostalgic tone,<ref name="NYT1"/> Kert<U+00E9>sz's images alluded to a sense of timelessness which was inevitiably only recognised after his death.<ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/> Unlike other photographers, Kert<U+00E9>sz's work gave an insight into his life, showing a chronological order of where he spent his time;<ref name="NYT2"/> for example, many of his French photographs were from caf<U+00E9>s where he spent the majority of his time waiting for artistic inspiration.<ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/> Although Kert<U+00E9>sz rarely received bad reviews, it was the lack of them which lead to the photographer feeling distant from recognition. Now however, he is often considered to be the father of photojournalism.<ref name="NYT3">{{Citation| last =Smith| first =Craig S.|title = Her Budapest, From Synagogue to Caf<U+00E9>| newspaper =The New York Times.| pages =| year =2006| date =October 7| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/07/books/07mart.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1190970537-YMiwnr9JUJMGhE0fWp1+UA}}</ref> Even other photographs cite Kert<U+00E9>sz and his photographs as being inspirational; [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]] once said of him in the early 1930s, "We all owe him a great deal".<ref name="Kert<U+00E9>sz: His Life and Work"/>
