The '''City of Manchester Stadium''' (also known as '''COMS''' or '''Eastlands''') is a [[stadium|sports venue]] in [[Manchester]], [[England]]. Originally designed as part of Manchester's [[2000 Summer Olympics#Bidding process|failed bid]] for the [[2000 Summer Olympics]], the stadium was built for the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]] at a cost of [[pound sterling|GB<U+00A3>]]110 million. After the Games, it was converted for use as a [[football (soccer)|football]] ground, and became the home of [[Manchester City F.C.]] who moved there from [[Maine Road]] in 2003, signing a 250-year [[lease]].

The stadium is bowl-shaped, with two tiers all the way around the ground and a third tier along the two side stands. As of [[23 June]] [[2007]], it is the [[List of English football stadia by capacity|fifth largest stadium]] in the [[FA Premier League]] and tenth largest in the [[United Kingdom]] with a seating capacity of 47,726. On [[4 October]] [[2006]] it was announced that the stadium will host the [[2008 in football (soccer)|2008]] [[UEFA Cup]] Final.

==History==
[[Image:City of Manchester Stadium 2002.jpg|thumb|left|Eastlands during the Commonwealth Games]]
Plans to build a stadium in east Manchester were first formulated as part of the city's bid to host the [[2000 Summer Olympics]], with [[Manchester City Council]] commissioning a design for an 80,000 capacity stadium on a [[brownfield land|brownfield]] site known colloquially as ''Eastlands''. However, in October 1993 the games were awarded to [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. Manchester subsequently made a successful bid to host the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]], using the stadium plans from the Olympic bid. In 1996, the planned stadium competed with [[Wembley Stadium]] to gain funding to become the national stadium but the money was used to redevelop Wembley.
The stadium's [[foundation stone]] was laid by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] in December 1999,<ref>{{cite web | title=The Road to the Commonwealth Games| work=Manchester City Council| url=http://www.manchester.gov.uk/corporate/games/road.htm| accessmonthday=July 27 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> and construction began in January 2000.<ref>{{cite web | title=City of Manchester Stadium| work=Centre for Accessible Environments| url=http://www.cae.org.uk/casemanchester.html| accessmonthday=July 22 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> The stadium was designed by [[Arup]] and constructed by [[John Laing|Laing]] at a cost of approximately <U+00A3>110 million, <U+00A3>77 million of which was provided by [[Sport England]], with the remainder funded by Manchester City Council.<ref name="legacy">{{cite web | title=City of Manchester Stadium| work=Commonwealth Games Legacy| url=http://www.gameslegacy.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi/30| accessmonthday=August 27 |accessyear=2006 }}</ref> For the Commonwealth Games the stadium featured a single lower tier running around three sides of the [[athletics (track and field)|athletics]] track, and second tiers to the two sides, with an open-air temporary stand at one end. The first public event at the stadium was the opening ceremony of the 2002 Commonwealth Games on [[25 July]] [[2002]]. Among the dignitaries present at the ceremony was [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]. During the ten days of competition, the stadium hosted all athletics events and the [[rugby sevens]]. Four Commonwealth records were set at the stadium, including the women's [[triple jump]] and the womens's [[5000 meters|5000&nbsp;m]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Land of Hope and Glory| work=Sporting Life| url=http://www.sportinglife.com/commonwealth_games/athletics/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=Sporting_Life/02/07/31/manual_203721.html| accessmonthday=August 27 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref>

[[Image:Eastlands East Stand.jpg|thumb|200px|The East Stand of the City of Manchester Stadium]]After the Commonwealth Games, extensive work was carried out on the stadium to convert it for use as a football stadium. Following the success of athletics events at the Commonwealth Games, the decision to convert the stadium into a football venue received criticism from athletics figures such as [[Jonathan Edwards (athlete)|Jonathan Edwards]] and [[Sebastian Coe]],<ref>{{cite web | title=Athletics' stadium claim is pipe dream | work=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/commonwealthgames2002/hi/features/newsid_2164000/2164264.stm| accessmonthday=August 27 |accessyear=2006 }}</ref> but redevelopment was deemed necessary to give the venue a financially viable long-term future. The track was removed and relaid at other athletics venues, and the ground level was lowered to make way for an additional tier of seating. The temporary stand was dismantled, and replaced with a permanent structure of similar design to the opposite end. This extensive work took a year and added 12,000 seats. Manchester City F.C. moved to the new ground for the [[FA Premier League 2003-04|2003<U+2013>04 season]]. The conversion cost <U+00A3>35 million, which was paid for by the football club.

The first football match at the stadium was a [[exhibition game|friendly]] between Manchester City and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] on [[10 August]] [[2003]]. Manchester City won the game 2-1, with the first [[Football pitch#Goals|goal]] at the stadium scored by [[Nicolas Anelka]]. The first competitive match followed four days later, a [[UEFA Cup 2002-03|UEFA Cup]] contest between Manchester City and [[Football in Wales|Welsh]] side [[The New Saints F.C.|TNS]], which City won 5-0. The record football attendance at the stadium is 47,304, which was set at a Premier League game when Manchester City beat [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] 1-0 on [[28 February]] [[2004]].

The stadium has also hosted several other sporting events. It became the 50th stadium to host an England international football match when [[England national football team|England]] played [[Japan national football team|Japan]] on [[1 June]] [[2004]], and on [[30 October]] of that year it played host to a [[rugby league]] match between [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] in the [[2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations|Tri-Nations]] series. In June 2005 the stadium hosted [[England women's national football team|England]]'s opening game in the [[2005 UEFA Women's Championship|UEFA Women's Championship]], setting an attendance record for the competition.<ref>{{cite web | title=Record Breakers| work=The FA| url=http://www.thefa.com/Euro2005/NewandFeatures/Postings/2005/02/Euro2005_FinlandPreview.htm| accessmonthday=August 29 |accessyear=2006 }}</ref> It is rated as a 4 star stadium by [[UEFA]], and has been selected to host the 2008 [[UEFA Cup]] Final.<ref>{{cite web | title=Man City stadium gets Uefa final| work=BBC| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/5407664.stm| accessmonthday=October 4 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref>

The stadium has a number of unofficial alternative names. ''Eastlands'' was used before the stadium was officially named and is still in common use, and ''City of Manchester Stadium'' is sometimes abbreviated to ''COMS'' when written. ''The Blue Camp'', a pun on [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]'s [[Camp Nou|Nou Camp]], found little favour.<ref>{{cite web | title=Kev plans glory for Blue Camp | work=Manchester Evening  News|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchestercity/s/64/64883_kev_plans_glory_for_blue_camp.html| accessmonthday=October 19 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> The stadium has generally received positive feedback from fans, coming second behind [[Old Trafford (football)|Old Trafford]] in a 2005 poll to find the United Kingdom's favourite football ground.<ref>{{cite web | title=Old Trafford 'UK's favourite football ground' | work=Life Style Extra|url=http://www.lse.co.uk/ShowStory.asp?story=GE117153Y&news_headline=old_trafford_uks_favourite_football_ground| accessmonthday=September 19 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> However, the atmosphere inside the stadium has sometimes faced criticism, with detractors regarding the atmosphere as inferior to that of Maine Road. But the atmosphere has improved as the seasons have gone by with the fans getting used to the stadium.<ref>{{cite web | title=Blue Moan | work=Daily Mirror|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/tm_objectid=15858014&method=full&siteid=94762&headline=football--blue-moan--name_page.html| accessmonthday=September 18 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref>

==Structure and facilities==
[[Image:CIMG1439.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The exterior of the stadium. Steel cables hold the roof in place.]]The interior of the City of Manchester Stadium is a continuous oval bowl, with three tiers of seating at the sides, and two tiers at each end. While the seating is continuous, each side of the stadium has its own name in the manner of a traditional football ground. Initially, all sides of the stadium were named by compass direction (''North Stand'' and ''South Stand'' for the ends, ''East Stand'' and ''West Stand'' for the sides). In February 2004 the West Stand was renamed the ''[[Colin Bell]] Stand'' in honour of the former player.<ref>{{cite web | title=Stand Named After Colin Bell | work=Manchester City Football Club|url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/default.sps?pageid=115&pagegid=%7BDBD12D53%2D8346%2D431D%2DA04F%2D5D0F8664DE80%7D&newsid=189702&siteid=&pageno=16&newscategory=1051&frommonth=1&fromyear=2004&tomonth=2&toyear=2004| accessmonthday=July 22 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> The South Stand has been officially named the ''[[Key 103]] Stand'' for sponsorship reasons since 2003,<ref>{{cite web | title=Official Sponsors | work=Manchester City Football Club|url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/default.sps?pagegid=%7B040DB726-0BEA-42EB-B38A-7911B5205ADE%7D&pcpageid=14729| accessmonthday=July 22 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> though this designation is largely ignored by supporters. A portion of the North Stand is designated the ''Family Stand'', and is reserved for supporters with children. The East Stand is unofficially known as ''the Kippax'' after the corresponding stand at Maine Road. Supporters of visiting teams are allocated part of the South Stand. There are 68 [[luxury box|executive boxes]] around the stadium, located along the West, North and East Stands. The boxes on the East and West stands seat 10 people inside and outside, while the boxes on the North Stand seat 8 people inside and outside.
[[Image:The B of the Bang, Manchester.jpg|thumb|150px|The [[B of the Bang]]]]
The stadium roof is [[toroid]]al in shape, and is suspended from steel cables attached to eight towers, which also provide access to the upper tiers of seating via spiral ramps. The areas without seating in each corner have moveable [[louver|louvres]], to allow for ventilation of the [[football pitch|pitch]]. Entry is gained by [[radio-frequency identification|RFID]] smart card rather than the traditional manned [[turnstile]]. This system can admit up to 1,200 people per minute around all entrances.<ref>{{cite web | title=Manchester City kicks off innovative smartcard services and sponsorships with wireless, RF-enabled Intelligent Stadium| work=Hewlett-Packard| url=http://h71028.www7.hp.com/ERC/downloads/5982-4314EN.pdf| accessmonthday=August 27 | accessyear=2006 }}(pdf)</ref> A service tunnel running under the stadium provides access for emergency vehicles, and allows the visiting team's [[coach (vehicle)|coach]] to enter the stadium directly. Inside the stadium are six [[theme restaurant|themed restaurants]], two of which have views of the pitch, and a number of conference facilities. The stadium is also licensed for [[wedding trends|marriage ceremonies]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Blue-heaven wedding| work=Manchester evening News| url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/80/80584_blueheaven_wedding.html| accessmonthday=August 28 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref>

The City of Manchester Stadium has the widest pitch in English football<ref>{{cite web | title=Around manchester| work=TheFA.com| url=http://www.thefa.com/Euro2005/NewandFeatures/Postings/2005/05/VenueGuide_Manchester.htm| accessmonthday=July 20 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> and features a natural grass pitch reinforced with [[artificial turf|artificial grass]] fibres made by [[Desso GrassMaster|Desso]].

The stadium is the centrepiece of an area known as [[Sportcity (sports ground)|Sportcity]] , which also includes several other sporting venues. Adjacent to the stadium is the ''Regional Athletics Arena'', which served as a warm-up track during the Commonwealth Games, and is now a 6,178 capacity venue that hosts national athletics trials and Manchester City reserve team games.<ref>{{cite book |last=Inglis |first=Simon |title=Played in Manchester |publisher=English Heritage |location=London |date=2004 |ISBN=1-97359-278-7}}</ref> The [[Manchester Velodrome]] and the National [[Squash (sport)|Squash]] Centre are a short distance from the stadium. In front of the stadium is the tallest sculpture in the UK, [[B of the Bang]], built to commemorate the success of the 2002 Commonwealth Games. In September 2006, Manchester City received planning permission to build an 85&nbsp;m (279&nbsp;ft) [[wind turbine]] at the stadium. Designed by [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]], the turbine will provide power for the stadium and nearby homes, and will make the City of Manchester Stadium the first in the world to be powered by its own turbine.<ref>{{cite web | title=City stadium turbine plan backed| work=BBC News| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/5389700.stm| accessmonthday=September 30 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref>

The City of Manchester Stadium has won a number of design awards, including the 2004 [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]] Inclusive Design Award for inclusivity in building design,<ref>{{cite web | title=City of Manchester Stadium wins The RIBA Inclusive Design Award | work=Royal Institute of British Architects|url=http://www.riba.org/go/RIBA/News/Press_4108.html| accessmonthday=July 21 |accessyear=2006 }}</ref> and the 2003 [[Institution of Structural Engineers]] Structural Special Award.<ref>{{cite web | title=Structural Special Award | work=Institution of Structural Engineers|url=http://www.istructe.org.uk/structuralawards/special03.asp| accessmonthday=July 21 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref>

On [[30 January]] [[2007]] it was announced that the UK's first [[regional casino|Super Casino]] would be built in the [[Sportcity (sports ground)|Sportcity]] area close to the stadium.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6312707.stm|title=Manchester wins super-casino race|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2007-01-30]]|accessdate=2007-01-31}}</ref>

==Transport==
The City of Manchester Stadium is located to the east of Manchester city centre. The stadium site itself has 2,000 parking spaces, with another 8,000 spaces in the surrounding area provided by local businesses and schools working in partnership with the football club. The nearest railway station is [[Ashburys railway station|Ashburys]], a 15-minute walk south of the stadium, though services are limited due to the small size of the station. [[Manchester Piccadilly station|Manchester Piccadilly]], which serves mainline trains from [[London]], [[Birmingham]] and [[Edinburgh]], is a 20-minute signposted walk away. Several special bus services serve the stadium when events take place.

An extension to the [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]] tram system with a stop at the stadium was announced in 2000, but following a government spending review the plan was put on hold in July 2004.<ref>{{cite web | title=End of the line for Big Bang tram plan | work=Manchester Evening News|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/124/124491_end_of_the_line_for_big_bang_tram_plan.htm| accessmonthday=July 23 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> However, in July 2006 funding for the extension was reinstated,<ref>{{cite web | title=Metrolink - the little Bang? | work=BBC|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2006/06/23/230606_metrolink_decision_messageboard_feature.shtml| accessmonthday=August 27 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> and the stadium will have its own Metrolink station sometime between 2008<U+2013>2010.

==Concerts==
Outside the football season the stadium hosts occasional [[concert]]s, and is one of the UK's largest music venues, having a maximum capacity of 60,000 for performances.<ref name="legacy" /> The first concert at the venue was a performance by the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] in 2004.
