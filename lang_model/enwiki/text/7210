==Meteorological history==
{{Main|Meteorological history of Hurricane Katrina}}
{{storm path|Katrina 2005 track.png}}
Hurricane Katrina formed as Tropical Depression Twelve over the southeastern Bahamas on August 23, 2005 as the result of an interaction of a [[tropical wave]] and the remains of [[Tropical Depression Ten (2005)|Tropical Depression Ten]]. The system was upgraded to [[Tropical cyclone#Intensity classifications|tropical storm status]] on the morning of August 24 and at this point, the storm was given the name ''Katrina.'' The tropical storm continued to move towards Florida, and became a hurricane only two hours before it made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] between [[Hallandale Beach, Florida|Hallandale Beach]] and [[Aventura, Florida]] on the morning of August 25. The storm weakened over land, but it regained hurricane status about one hour after entering the Gulf of Mexico.<ref name="KatrinaTCR" />

The storm [[rapid deepening|rapidly intensified]] after entering the Gulf, growing from a Category&nbsp;3 hurricane to a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane in just nine hours. This rapid growth was due to the storm's movement over the "unusually warm" [[sea surface temperature|waters]] of the [[Loop Current]], which increased wind speeds.<ref>Leben, Robert; Born, George; Scott, Jim. "[http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2005/358.html CU-Boulder Researchers Chart Katrina's Growth In Gulf Of Mexico]." ''[[University of Colorado at Boulder]].'' September 15, 2005. Retrieved on 2006-06-05, and 2008-04-09.</ref> On Saturday, August 27, the storm reached Category&nbsp;3 intensity on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]], becoming the third [[Tropical cyclone#Categories and ranking|major hurricane]] of the season. An [[eyewall#Eyewall replacement cycles|eyewall replacement cycle]] disrupted the intensification, but caused the storm to nearly double in size. Katrina again rapidly intensified, attaining Category&nbsp;5 status on the morning of August 28 and reached its peak strength at 1:00&nbsp;p.m. CDT that day, with maximum sustained winds of 175&nbsp;mph (280&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum central [[atmospheric pressure|pressure]] of 902&nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]]. The pressure measurement made Katrina the fourth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record at the time, only to be surpassed by Hurricanes [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] and [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]] later in the season; it was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico at the time (a record also later broken by Rita).<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/>

Katrina made its second landfall at 6:10&nbsp;a.m. CDT<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/> on Monday, August 29 as a Category&nbsp;3 hurricane with sustained winds of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h) near [[Buras-Triumph, Louisiana]]. At landfall, hurricane-force winds extended outward 120&nbsp;miles (190&nbsp;km) from the center and the storm's central pressure was 920&nbsp;mbar. After moving over southeastern Louisiana and [[Breton Sound]], it made its third landfall near the Louisiana/Mississippi border with 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h) sustained winds, still at Category&nbsp;3 intensity.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/>

Katrina maintained strength well into Mississippi, finally losing hurricane strength more than 150&nbsp;miles (240&nbsp;km) inland near [[Meridian, Mississippi]]. It was downgraded to a tropical depression near [[Clarksville, Tennessee]], but its remnants were last distinguishable in the eastern [[Great Lakes]] region on August 31, when it was absorbed by a [[Surface weather analysis#cold front|frontal boundary]]. The resulting [[extratropical]] storm moved rapidly to the northeast and affected eastern Canada.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/>

In a September 26, 2005 hearing, former FEMA chief Michael Brown testified before a U.S. House subcommittee about FEMA's response.

{{Main|Effects of Hurricane Katrina in Florida}}
Hurricane Katrina first made landfall on August 25, 2005 in [[South Florida]] where it hit as a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane, with 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h) winds. Rainfall was heavy in places and exceeded 14&nbsp;inches (350&nbsp;mm) in [[Homestead, Florida]],<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/> and a storm surge of 3 <U+2013> {{convert|5|ft|m}} was measured in parts of [[Monroe County, Florida|Monroe County]].<ref name="katreport"/> More than 1&nbsp;million customers were left without [[electricity]], and damage in Florida was estimated from $1 <U+2013> $2&nbsp;billion, with most of the damage coming from flooding and overturned trees. There were 14 fatalities reported in Florida as a result of Hurricane Katrina.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/>

Most of the [[Florida Keys]] experienced tropical-storm force winds from Katrina as the storm's center passed to the north, with hurricane force winds reported in the [[Dry Tortugas]]. Rainfall was also high in the islands, with 10&nbsp;inches (250&nbsp;mm) falling on [[Key West, Florida|Key West]]. On August 26, a strong [[Fujita scale|F1]] [[tornado]] formed from an outer rain band of Katrina and struck [[Marathon, Florida|Marathon]]. The tornado damaged a hangar at the airport there and caused an estimated $5&nbsp;million in damage.<ref name="Marathon Tornado">Devenas, Andy "[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/key/HTML/Marathon_Report.pdf Marathon Tornado Survey Report]."

Although Hurricane Katrina stayed well to the north of [[Cuba]], on August 29 it brought tropical-storm force winds and rainfall of over 8&nbsp;inches (200&nbsp;mm) to western regions of the island. Telephone and power lines were damaged and around 8,000&nbsp;people were evacuated in the [[Pinar del R<U+00ED>o Province]]. According to Cuban television reports the coastal city of Surgidero de Batabano was 90% underwater.<ref name="Cuba damage">Staff Writer.

===Louisiana===
[[File:PostVeniceLG.jpg|left|thumb|Flooding in [[Venice, Louisiana]]]]
On August 29, Hurricane Katrina made landfall near [[Buras, Louisiana]] with 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h) winds, as a strong Category&nbsp;3 storm. However, as it had only just weakened from Category&nbsp;4 strength and the radius of maximum winds was large, it is possible that sustained winds of Category&nbsp;4 strength briefly impacted extreme southeastern Louisiana. Although the storm surge to the east of the path of the eye in Mississippi was higher, a very significant surge affected the Louisiana coast. The height of the surge is uncertain because of a lack of data, although a tide gauge in [[Plaquemines Parish]] indicated a storm tide in excess of 14&nbsp;feet (4.3&nbsp;m) and a 12-foot (3&nbsp;m) storm surge was recorded in [[Grand Isle, Louisiana|Grand Isle]].<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/>

Hurricane Katrina also brought heavy rain to Louisiana, with 8 <U+2013> 10&nbsp;inches (200 <U+2013> 250&nbsp;mm) falling on a wide swath of the eastern part of the state. In the area around [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]], the rainfall was even higher, and the highest rainfall recorded in the state was approximately 15&nbsp;inches (380&nbsp;mm). As a result of the rainfall and storm surge the level of [[Lake Pontchartrain]] rose and caused significant flooding along its northeastern shore, affecting communities from Slidell to [[Mandeville, Louisiana|Mandeville]]. Several bridges were destroyed, including the [[I-10 Twin Span Bridge]] connecting Slidell to New Orleans.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/> Almost 900,000&nbsp;people in Louisiana lost power as a result of Hurricane Katrina.<ref name="Power failures">Staff Writer.

Hard-hit [[St. Bernard Parish]] was flooded due to breaching of the levees that contained a navigation channel called the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MR-GO) and the breach of the Levee Board designed and built 40 Arpent canal levee. The search for the missing was undertaken by the St. Bernard Fire Department due to the assets of the [[United States Coast Guard]] being diverted to New Orleans. According to an interview in the ''[[New Orleans Times-Picayune]]'', the coroner was still trying to get a list of missing from the [[Red Cross]] in November 2005. While there were some victims on this list whose bodies were found in their homes, the vast majority were tracked down through word-of-mouth and credit card records. As of December 2005, the official missing list in the Parish stood at 47.<ref>Cannizaro, Steve.

[[File:KatrinaNewOrleansFlooded edit2.jpg|thumb|Flooded I-10/I-610/West End Blvd [[interchange (road)|interchange]] and surrounding area of northwest New Orleans and Metairie, Louisiana]]
As the eye of Hurricane Katrina swept to the northeast, it subjected the city to hurricane conditions for hours. Although power failures prevented accurate measurement of wind speeds in New Orleans, there were a few measurements of hurricane-force winds. From this the NHC concluded that it is likely that much of the city experienced sustained winds of Category&nbsp;1 or Category&nbsp;2 strength.

Katrina's storm surge led to 53 levee breaches in the federally built levee system protecting metro New Orleans and the failure of the 40 Arpent Canal levee. Failures occurred in New Orleans and surrounding communities, especially St. Bernard Parish. The [[Mississippi River Gulf Outlet]] (MR-GO) breached its levees in approximately 20 places, flooding much of east New Orleans, most of [[Saint Bernard Parish, Louisiana|Saint Bernard Parish]] and the East Bank of [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana|Plaquemines Parish]]. The major levee breaches in the city included breaches at the [[17th Street Canal]] levee, the [[London Avenue Canal]], and the wide, navigable [[Industrial Canal]], which left approximately 80% of the city flooded.<ref>Murphy, Verity.

Most of the major roads traveling into and out of the city were damaged. The only routes out of the city were the westbound [[Crescent City Connection]] and the Huey P. Long Bridge, as large portions of the I-10 Twin Span Bridge traveling eastbound towards Slidell, Louisiana had collapsed. Both the [[Lake Pontchartrain Causeway]] and the Crescent City Connection only carried emergency traffic.<ref>Gordon, Meghan.

The Superdome, which was sheltering many people who had not evacuated, sustained significant damage. Two sections of the Superdome's roof were compromised and the dome's waterproof membrane had essentially been peeled off. [[Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport]] was closed before the storm but did not flood. On August 30, it was reopened to humanitarian and rescue operations. Limited commercial passenger service resumed at the airport on September 13 and regular carrier operations resumed in early October.<ref name="New Orleans Airport">Staff Writer.

The Gulf coast of Mississippi suffered massive damage from the impact of Hurricane Katrina on August 29, leaving 238&nbsp;people dead, 67&nbsp;missing, and billions of dollars in damage: bridges, barges, boats, piers, houses and cars were washed inland.<ref name=HBrecov>{{cite web | title =Information Relating to the Federal Appropriations for Katrina Recovery|date = January 6, 2006 | accessdate = 2006-09-27 | author = Haley Babour | publisher = Office of the Governor, Mississippi | url = http://www.governorbarbour.com/Recovery/news/2006/jan/information.html}}</ref>
Katrina traveled up the entire state, and afterwards, all 82 counties in Mississippi were declared disaster areas for federal assistance, 47 for full assistance.<ref name=HBrecov/>

After making a brief initial landfall in Louisiana, Katrina had made its final landfall near the state line, and the eyewall passed over the cities of Bay St. Louis and Waveland as a Category&nbsp;3 hurricane with sustained winds of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/> Katrina's powerful right-front quadrant passed over the west and central Mississippi coast, causing a powerful 27-foot (8.2&nbsp;m) storm surge, which penetrated 6&nbsp;miles (10&nbsp;km) inland in many areas and up to 12&nbsp;miles (20&nbsp;km) inland along bays and rivers; in some areas, the surge crossed [[Interstate 10]] for several miles.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/> Hurricane Katrina brought strong winds to Mississippi, which caused significant tree damage throughout the state. The highest unofficial reported wind gust recorded from Katrina was one of 135&nbsp;mph (217&nbsp;km/h) in [[Poplarville, Mississippi|Poplarville]], in [[Pearl River County, Mississippi|Pearl River County]].<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/>

[[File:Hurricane katrina damage gulfport mississippi.jpg|thumb|left|Damage to [[Long Beach, Mississippi]] following Hurricane Katrina]]
The storm also brought heavy rains with 8 <U+2013> 10&nbsp;inches (200 <U+2013> 250&nbsp;mm) falling in southwestern Mississippi and rain in excess of 4&nbsp;inches (100&nbsp;mm) falling throughout the majority of the state. Katrina caused eleven tornadoes in Mississippi on August 29, some of which damaged trees and power lines.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/>

Battered by wind, rain and storm surge, some beachfront neighborhoods were completely leveled. Preliminary estimates by Mississippi officials calculated that 90% of the structures within half a mile of the coastline were completely destroyed,<ref name="CBS Miss">Staff Writer.

More than half of the 13 casinos in the state, which were floated on barges to comply with Mississippi land-based gambling laws, were washed hundreds of yards inland by waves.<ref name="CBS Miss"/>

A number of streets and bridges were washed away. On [[U.S. Highway 90]] along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, two major bridges were completely destroyed: the Bay St. Louis - Pass Christian<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/> bridge, and the Biloxi - [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi|Ocean Springs]] bridge. In addition, the eastbound span of the I-10 bridge over the [[Pascagoula River]] estuary was damaged. In the weeks after the storm, with the connectivity of the coastal U.S. Highway 90 shattered, traffic traveling parallel to the coast was reduced first to State Road 11 (parallel to I-10) then to two lanes on the remaining I-10 span when it was opened.

All three coastal counties of the state were severely affected by the storm. Katrina's surge was the most extensive, as well as the highest, in the documented history of the United States; large portions of both [[Hancock County, Mississippi|Hancock]], [[Harrison County, Mississippi|Harrison]], and [[Jackson County, Mississippi|Jackson]] Counties were inundated by the storm surge, in all three cases affecting most of the populated areas.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] | title = Mississippi Hurricane Katrina Surge Inundation and Advisory Base Flood Elevation Map Panel Overview | month= November | year= 2005 | accessdate = 2006-07-16 | format = PDF | publisher = FEMA|url = http://www.fema.gov/pdf/hazard/flood/recoverydata/katrina/ms_overview.pdf}}</ref> Surge covered almost the entire lower half of Hancock County, destroying the coastal communities of [[Clermont Harbor, Mississippi|Clermont Harbor]] and Waveland, much of Bay St. Louis, and flowed up the Jourdan River, flooding Diamondhead and [[Kiln, Mississippi|Kiln]]. In Harrison County, [[Pass Christian]] was completely inundated, along with a narrow strip of land to the east along the coast, which includes the cities of Long Beach and Gulfport; the flooding was more extensive in communities such as D'Iberville, which borders Back Bay. [[Biloxi]], on a peninsula between the Back Bay and the coast, was particularly hard hit, especially the low-lying Point Cadet area. In Jackson County, storm surge flowed up the wide river [[estuary]], with the combined surge and freshwater flooding cutting the county in half. Remarkably, over 90% of Pascagoula, the easternmost coastal city in Mississippi, and about {{convert|75|mi|km|0}} east of Katrina's landfall near the Louisiana-Mississippi border, was flooded from surge at the height of the storm. Other large Jackson County neighborhoods such as Porteaux Bay and Gulf Hills were severely damaged with large portions being completely destroyed, and [[St. Martin, Mississippi|St. Martin]] was hard hit; Ocean Springs, [[Moss Point, Mississippi|Moss Point]], Gautier, and [[Escatawpa]] also suffered major surge damage.

Mississippi Emergency Management Agency officials also recorded deaths in [[Forrest County, Mississippi|Forrest]], [[Hinds County, Mississippi|Hinds]], [[Warren County, Mississippi|Warren]], and [[Leake County, Mississippi|Leake]] counties. Over 900,000&nbsp;people throughout the state experienced power outages.<ref name="Power failures"/>

===Southeast United States===
[[File:KatrinaMobileCourthouseSteps.jpg|thumb|left|Flood waters come up the steps of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile's]] federal courthouse.]]
Although Hurricane Katrina made landfall well to the west, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle were both affected by tropical-storm force winds and a storm surge varying from 12 to 16&nbsp;feet (3<U+2013>5&nbsp;m) around [[Mobile Bay]],<ref name=KatrinaTCR/> with higher waves on top. Sustained winds of 67&nbsp;mph (107&nbsp;km/h) were recorded in [[Mobile, Alabama]], and the storm surge there was approximately 12&nbsp;feet (3.7&nbsp;m).<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/> The surge caused significant flooding several miles inland along Mobile Bay. Four tornadoes were also reported in Alabama.<ref name=KatrinaTCR/> Ships, oil rigs, boats and fishing [[pier]]s were washed ashore along Mobile Bay: the cargo ship M/V ''Caribbean Clipper'' and many fishing boats were grounded at [[Bayou La Batre]].

An [[oil rig]] under construction along the [[Mobile River]] broke its moorings and floated 1.5&nbsp;miles (2&nbsp;km) northwards before striking the [[Cochrane Bridge]] just outside Mobile. No significant damage resulted to the bridge and it was soon reopened. The damage on [[Dauphin Island]] was severe, with the surge destroying many houses and cutting a new canal through the western portion of the island. An offshore oil rig also became grounded on the island. As in Mississippi, the storm surge caused significant beach erosion along the Alabama coastline.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/> More than 600,000&nbsp;people lost power in Alabama as a result of Hurricane Katrina and two people died in a traffic accident in the state. Residents in some areas, such as Selma, were without power for several days.<ref name="Power failures"/>

Along the Florida Panhandle the storm surge was typically about five&nbsp;feet (1.5&nbsp;m) and along the west-central Florida coast there was a minor surge of 1 <U+2013> 2&nbsp;feet (0.3 <U+2013> 0.6&nbsp;m). In [[Pensacola, Florida]] 56&nbsp;mph (90&nbsp;km/h) winds were recorded on August 29. The winds caused damage to some trees and structures and there was some minor flooding in the Panhandle. There were two indirect fatalities from Katrina in [[Walton County, Florida|Walton County]] as a result of a traffic accident.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/> In the Florida Panhandle, 77,000 customers lost power.<ref>Associated Press, "Katrina at a Glance" (August 31, 2005), page 4A, ''Mobile Register'', web: [http://www.al.com/mobileregister/pdf/register083105a.pdf MobileRegister-083105-PDF].</ref>

Northern and central [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] were affected by heavy rains and strong winds from Hurricane Katrina as the storm moved inland, with more than 3&nbsp;inches (75&nbsp;mm) of rain falling in several areas. At least 18 tornadoes formed in Georgia on August 29, the most on record in that state for one day in August. The most serious of these tornadoes was an F2 tornado which affected [[Heard County, Georgia|Heard County]] and [[Carroll County, Georgia|Carroll County]]. This tornado caused 3 injuries and one fatality and damaged several houses. In addition this tornado destroyed several poultry barns, killing over 140,000 chicks. The other tornadoes caused significant damages to buildings and agricultural facilities.

Katrina also had a profound impact on the environment. The storm surge caused substantial [[Coastal erosion|beach erosion]], in some cases completely devastating coastal areas. In Dauphin Island, approximately 90&nbsp;miles (150&nbsp;[[km]]) to the east of the point where the hurricane made landfall, the sand that comprised the [[barrier island]] was transported across the island into the [[Mississippi Sound]], pushing the island towards land.<ref>{{cite web | author = [[United States Geological Survey]] | date = September 14, 2005 | url = http://coastal.er.usgs.gov/hurricanes/katrina/lidar/dauphin-island.html | title = Daupin Island - Pre- and Post-Storm 3D Topography | work = Hurricane Katrina Impact Studies | publisher = [[USGS]] | accessdate = 2006-06-05}}</ref> The storm surge and waves from Katrina also obliterated the [[Chandeleur Islands]], which had been affected by Hurricane Ivan the previous year.<ref>{{cite web | author = United States Geological Survey | date = September 14, 2005 | url = http://coastal.er.usgs.gov/hurricanes/katrina/photo-comparisons/chandeleur.html | title = Before and After Photo Comparisons: Chandeleur Islands | work = Hurricane Katrina Impact Studies|publisher = USGS | accessdate = 2006-06-05}}</ref>  The US Geological Survey has estimated {{convert|217|sqmi|km2}} of land was transformed to water by the hurricanes Katrina and Rita.<ref>[http://www.nwrc.usgs.gov/releases/pr06_002.htm "USGS Reports Latest Land Change Estimates for Louisiana Coast", USGS National Wetlands Research Center, 3 Oct 2006], accessed 7 May 2008</ref>

Prior to the storm, [[subsidence]] and [[erosion]] caused erosion in the Louisiana wetlands and [[bayou]]s.

Within the United States and as delineated in the [[National Response Plan]], disaster response and planning is first and foremost a local government responsibility. When local government exhausts its resources, it then requests specific additional resources from the county level. The request process proceeds similarly from the county to the state to the federal government as additional resource needs are identified. Many of the problems that arose developed from inadequate planning and back-up communications systems at various levels.<ref name="usgovwh"/>

Some [[disaster recovery]] response to Katrina began before the storm, with [[Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States|Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) preparations that ranged from logistical supply deployments to a [[mortuary]] team with refrigerated trucks.

===Criticism of government response===
[[File:USNS Comfort.jpg|thumb|left|[[USNS Comfort|USNS ''Comfort'']] takes on supplies at [[Mayport, Florida]] en route to the Gulf Coast.]]
{{Main|Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina}}
The criticisms of the government's response to Hurricane Katrina primarily consisted of condemnations of [[Administrative incompetence|mismanagement]] and lack of [[leadership]] in the relief efforts in response to the storm and its aftermath. More specifically, the criticism focused on the delayed response to the flooding of New Orleans, and the subsequent state of chaos in the Crescent City.<ref name="thevenot" />  The [[neologism]] ''Katrinagate'' was coined to refer to this controversy, and was a runner-up for "2005 word of the year."<ref>Clark, Heather. "[http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=1480616 Linguists Vote 'Truthiness' Word of 2005]." ''ABC News.'' January 6, 2006. Retrieved on July 18, 2006.</ref>

Within days of Katrina's August 29, 2005 landfall, public debate arose about the local, state and federal governments' role in the [[Preparations for Hurricane Katrina|preparations]] for and response to the hurricane. [[Criticism]] was initially prompted by televised images of visibly shaken and frustrated political leaders, and of residents who remained stranded by flood waters without [[drinking water|water]], [[food]] or shelter. Deaths from [[thirst]], [[exhaustion]], and [[violence]], days after the storm had passed, fueled the criticism, as did the dilemma of the evacuees at facilities such as the Louisiana Superdome (designed to handle 800, yet 30,000 arrived)and the New Orleans Civic Center (not designed as an evacuation center, yet 25,000 arrived). Some alleged that [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[social class|class]], and other factors could have contributed to delays in government response. The percentage of black victims among storm-related deaths (49%)<ref name=LaDHH>{{cite web | title = Updated Number of Deceased Victims Recovered Following Hurricane Katrina | date = December 9, 2005 | accessdate = 2006-08-01 | publisher = Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals|url = http://www.dhh.state.la.us/news.asp?Detail=758}}</ref> was below their proportion in the area's population (approx. 60%<ref>"[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/08/18/national/main1913712.shtml?source=RSS&attr=U.S._1913712 New Orleans population statistics]."

).

In accordance with federal law, then-President George W. Bush directed the [[Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security]], Michael Chertoff, to coordinate the Federal response. Chertoff designated Michael D. Brown, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as the Principal Federal Official to lead the deployment and coordination of all federal response resources and forces in the Gulf Coast region. However, the President and Secretary Chertoff initially came under harsh criticism for what some perceived as a lack of planning and coordination, even though Governor Blanco resisted their efforts. Eight days later, Brown was recalled to Washington and Coast Guard Vice Admiral [[Thad W. Allen]] replaced him as chief of hurricane relief operations.<ref>Meserve, Jeanne; Barrett, Ted.

On September 2, 2005, during a [[benefit concert]] for Hurricane Katrina relief on [[NBC]], ''[[A Concert for Hurricane Relief]]'', [[Kanye West]] was a featured speaker. Controversy arose when West was presenting, as he deviated from the prepared script:

<blockquote>''I hate the way they portray us in the media. You see a black family, it says, 'They're looting.' You see a white family, it says, 'They're looking for food.' And, you know, it's been five days &#91;waiting for federal help&#93; because most of the people are black. And even for me to complain about it, I would be a hypocrite because I've tried to turn away from the teacher-the TV because it's too hard to watch. I've even been shopping before even giving a donation, so now I'm calling my business manager right now to see what is the biggest amount I can give, and just to imagine if I was down there, and those are my people down there. So anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can help <U+2014> with the way America is set up to help the poor, the black people, the less well-off, as slow as possible. I mean, the Red Cross is doing everything they can. We already realize a lot of people that could help are at war right now, fighting another way <U+2014> and they've given them permission to go down and shoot us!''</blockquote>

[[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]], with whom West was paired to present, spoke next and continued as normal by reading the script. Once it was his turn to speak again, West added, "George Bush doesn't care about [[black people]]." Although the camera quickly cut away to [[Chris Tucker]], West's comments still reached the East Coast broadcasts, and were replayed and discussed afterwards.<ref>{{cite news|last=de Moraes|first=Lisa|title=Kanye West's Torrent of Criticism, Live on NBC|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/03/AR2005090300165.html|work=The Washington Post|date=2005-09-03|accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref>

Criticism from politicians, activists, pundits and journalists of all stripes was directed at the local and state and governments headed by Mayor Ray Nagin of New Orleans and Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco. Nagin and Blanco were criticized for failing to implement New Orleans' evacuation plan and for ordering residents to a shelter of last resort without any provisions for food, water, security, or sanitary conditions. Perhaps the most important criticism of Nagin was that he delayed his emergency evacuation order until 19&nbsp;hours before landfall, which led to hundreds of deaths of people who (by that time) could not find any way out of the city.<ref name="CongressInvestigation"/>

The destruction wrought by Hurricane Katrina raised other, more general public policy issues about [[emergency management]], [[environmental policy]], [[poverty]], and [[unemployment]]. The discussion of both the immediate response and of the broader public policy issues may have affected [[elections]] and [[legislation]] enacted at various [[Executive (government)|levels of government]]. The storm's devastation also prompted a Congressional investigation, which found that FEMA and the Red Cross "did not have a logistics capacity sophisticated enough to fully support the massive number of Gulf coast victims." Additionally, it placed responsibility for the disaster on all three levels of government.<ref name="CongressInvestigation"/>

During and after the Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma and Rita, the American Red Cross had opened 1,470 different shelters across and registered 3.8&nbsp;million overnight stays. None were allowed in New Orleans however. A total of 244,000 Red Cross workers (95% of which were non-paid volunteers) were utilized throughout these three hurricanes. In addition, 346,980 comfort kits (such as toothpaste, soap, washcloths and toys for children) and 205,360 cleanup kits (containing brooms, mops and bleach) were distributed. For mass care, the organization served 68&nbsp;million snacks and meals to victims of the disasters and to rescue workers. The Red Cross also had its Disaster Health services meet 596,810 contacts, and Disaster Mental Health services met 826,590 contacts.

===Analysis of New Orleans levee failures===
{{Main|2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans}}
[[File:Hurricane Katrina Eye viewed from Hurricane Hunter.jpg|left|thumb|View of the eyewall of Hurricane Katrina taken on August 28, 2005, as seen from a [[NOAA]] [[WP-3D Orion|WP-3D]] [[hurricane hunter]] aircraft before the storm made landfall on the United States [[Gulf Coast]].]]
A June 2007 report released by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] states that the failures of the locally built and federally funded levees in New Orleans were found to be primarily the result of system design flaws.<ref name="ASCE HKERP report"/> The [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] who by federal mandate is responsible for the conception, design and construction of the region's flood-control system failed to pay sufficient attention to public safety. The Levee Boards had hamstrung the Army Corps.

According to new modeling and field observations by a team from [[Louisiana State University]], the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MRGO), a 200-meter-wide (660-foot-wide) canal designed to provide a shortcut from New Orleans to the Gulf of Mexico, helped provide a funnel for the storm surge, making it 20% higher and 100%-200% faster as it crashed into the city. St. Bernard Parish, one of the more devastated areas, lies just south of the MRGO. The [[Army Corps of Engineers]] disputes this causality and maintains Katrina would have overwhelmed the levees with or without the contributing effect of the MRGO.<ref>Warrick, Joby; Grunwald, Michael. "[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/23/AR2005102301200_pf.html Investigators Link Levee Failures to Design Flaws]." ''Washington Post.'' October 24, 2005. Retrieved on 2006-06-05.</ref> The water flowing west from the storm surge was perpendicular to MRGO, and thus the canal had a negligible effect.

On April 5, 2006, months after independent investigators had demonstrated that levee failures were not caused by natural forces beyond intended design strength, Lieutenant General Carl Strock testified before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Water that "We have now concluded we had problems with the design of the structure."<ref>Staff Writers "[http://www.unregisterednews.com/content/view/184/53/ Problems with the design of levees]{{Dead link|date=October 2008}}." ''[[Unregistered News]].'' September 29, 2005. Retrieved on 2007-05-25.</ref> He also testified that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers did not know of this mechanism of failure prior to August 29, 2005. The claim of ignorance is refuted, however, by the National Science Foundation investigators hired by the Army Corps of Engineers, who point to a 1986 study by the Corps itself that such separations were possible in the I-wall design.<ref>{{cite news| title = Corps chief admits to 'design failure' | author = Walsh, Bill | publisher = Times Picayune|date = April 6, 2006 | accessdate=2006-04-09 | url = http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?/base/news-5/1144306231230500.xml}}</ref> As the levee walls were mandated by the Levee Boards and were designed by local firms under the control of the Levee Boards, the Army Corps had little choice. The Army Corps had recommended 72 foot pilings be used, yet the Leveee Boards argued and prevailed that 24 foot pilings would be sufficient.

Various [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] began floating around that the levees were in fact deliberately demolished. A number of New Orleans residents described hearing "explosions" coming from the Industrial Canal levee in the [[Lower 9th Ward]] before the floodwaters rushed in. A National Guard worker claims he was sworn to secrecy upon finding explosives residue at the site of the break.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/orleans_levees.html|title=New Orleans Levees Were Blown In 1927}}</ref> The fracture of the wall due to a barge hitting it would also be an explanation of the loud noise heard.

Many of the levees have been reconstructed since the time of Katrina. In reconstructing them, precautions were taken to bring the levees up to modern building code standards and to ensure their safety. For example, in every situation possible, the Corps of Engineers replaced I-walls with T-walls. T-walls have a horizontal concrete base that protects against soil erosion underneath the floodwalls.<ref name=Walls>{{cite news | first=Matt | last=Crenson | publisher=Associated Press | url=http://www.constructionequipmentguide.com/story.asp?story=6589 | title=Levee Repairs to Be Finished By First Day of Hurricane Season | date=2006-02-02 | accessdate=2008-05-12}}</ref>

However, there are funding battles over the remaining levee improvements. In February 2008, the Bush administration requested that the state of Louisiana pay about $1.5&nbsp;billion of an estimated $7.2&nbsp;billion for Army Corps of Engineers levee work, a proposal which angered many Louisiana leaders.<ref name=funding>{{cite news | title=White House Budget for Levee Work Riles Many Louisiana Elected Officials | publisher=Associated Press | first=Cain | last=Burdeau | url=http://www.cegltd.com/story.asp?story=10045 | date=2008-02-12 | accessdate=2008-05-12}}</ref>

On May 2, 2008, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal used a speech to The National Press Club to request that President Bush free up money to complete work on Louisiana's levees. Bush promised to include the levee funding in his 2009 budget, but rejected the idea of including the funding in a war bill, which would pass sooner.<ref name=BushJindal>{{cite web | url=http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/18539869.html | title =Jindal asks Bush for levee cash | p ublisher=2theadvocate.com | first=Gerard | last=Shields | date=2008-05-03 | accessdate=2008-05-12}}</ref>

===Media involvement===
{{Main|Media involvement in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina}}
[[File:Geraldo-Rivera-Katrina-Aftermath-FNC.jpg|thumb|[[Geraldo Rivera]] reporting from the New Orleans Convention Center on September 2, 2005.]]
Many representatives of the [[news media]] reporting on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina became directly involved in the unfolding events, instead of simply reporting. Because of the loss of most means of communication, such as land-based and cellular telephone systems, field reporters in many cases became conduits for information between victims and authorities.

The authorities, who monitored local and network news broadcasts, as well as internet sites, would then attempt to coordinate rescue efforts based on the reports. One illustration was when [[Geraldo Rivera]] of [[Fox News]] tearfully pleaded for authorities to either send help or evacuate the thousands of evacuees stranded at the [[Ernest N. Morial Convention Center]].<ref>"[http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2678976 Geraldo Rivera & Shepard Smith Unleashed]." &mdash; ''Video.'' 2005. Retrieved on 2006-06-05.</ref>

The storm also brought a dramatic rise in the role of [[Website|Internet sites]] - especially [[blogging]] and community journalism. One example was the effort of ''NOLA.com'', the web affiliate of New Orleans' ''[[The Times-Picayune|Times-Picayune]]'', which was awarded the Breaking News [[Pulitzer Prize]],<ref name="Pulitzer BN">{{cite web | author = The Pulitzer Board | title = 2006 Pulitzer Prize Winners - Breaking News Reporting | year= 2006 | accessdate = 2008-11-15 | url = http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2006,Breaking+News+Reporting}}</ref> and shared the Public Service Pulitzer with the Biloxi-based ''[[The Sun Herald|Sun Herald]]''.<ref name="Pulitzer PS">{{cite web | author = The Pulitzer Board | title = 2006 Pulitzer Prize Winners - Public Service | year= 2006 | accessdate = 2008-11-15 | url = http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2006,Public+Service}}</ref> The newspaper's coverage was carried for days only on NOLA's blogs, as the newspaper lost its presses and evacuated its building as water rose around it on August 30. The site became an international focal point for news by local media, and also became a vital link for rescue operations and later for reuniting scattered residents, as it accepted and posted thousands of individual pleas for rescue on its blogs and forums. NOLA was monitored constantly by an array of rescue teams - from individuals to the Coast Guard - which used information in rescue efforts. Much of this information was relayed from trapped victims via the SMS functions of their cell phones, to friends and relatives outside the area, who then relayed the information back to NOLA.com. The aggregation of community journalism, user photos and the use of the internet site as a collaborative response to the storm attracted international attention, and was called a watershed moment in journalism.<ref name="OJR NOLA">{{cite web | author = Mark Glaser | title = NOLA.com blogs and forums help save lives after Katrina | date = September 13, 2005 | publisher = Online Journalism Review | accessdate = 2006-08-02 | url = http://www.ojr.org/ojr/stories/050913glaser/}}</ref> In the wake of these online-only efforts, the Pulitzer Committee for the first time opened all its categories to online entries.<ref name="Pulitzer speech">{{cite web | author = [[Paul Steiger]] | title = Remarks at Pulitzer Prize luncheon|date = May 22, 2006 | accessdate = 2008-11-15 | publisher = The Pulitzer Board | url = http://www.pulitzer.org/2006_luncheon_steiger}}</ref>

The role of AM radio was of importance to the hundreds of thousands of persons with no other ties to news. [[AM radio]] provided emergency information regarding access to assistance for hurricane victims. Immediately after Hurricane Katrina, radio station [[WWL-AM]] (New Orleans) was one of the few area radio stations in the area remaining on the air. The 870 kHz frequency has a [[Clear-channel stations|clear channel]] high power designation and the on-going nighttime broadcasts continued to be available up to {{convert|500|mi|km}} away. Announcers continued to broadcast from improvised studio facilities after the storm damaged their transmitter tower.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

During the period of several weeks when most area radio stations were off the air, WWL-AM's emergency coverage was simulcast on the frequencies of other area radio stations. This emergency service was named "[[United Radio Broadcasters of New Orleans|The United Radio Broadcasters of New Orleans]]." To reach emergency radio operators in storm-ravaged areas, many of whom made their volunteer services available to the Red Cross and government entities, WWL-AM was simulcast on shortwave outlet [[WHRI]], owned by World Harvest Radio International. The [[cellular phone]] antenna network was severely damaged and completely inoperable for several months.

As the U.S. military and rescue services regained control over the city, there were restrictions on the activity of the media. On September 9, the military leader of the relief effort announced that reporters would have "zero access" to efforts to recover bodies in New Orleans. Immediately following this announcement, CNN filed a [[lawsuit]] and obtained a temporary [[restraining order]] against the ban. The next day the government backed down and reversed the ban.<ref name="Media Ban">Staff Writer. "[http://edition.cnn.com/2005/LAW/09/10/katrina.media/ U.S. won't ban media from New Orleans searches]." ''CNN.'' September 11, 2005. Retrieved on 2006-06-05.</ref>

Hurricane Katrina has also been the centerpiece of several documentary films, including [[Spike Lee]]'s film, ''[[When the Levees Broke]]'', and [[Darren Martinez]]'s film, ''Hellp''.<ref>Britt, M. "Las Vegas Teen Helps Hurricane Victims In New Orleans", ''Las Vegas Daily Optic'', December 19, 2005,</ref>  An episode of the Fox TV series [[House (TV Series)|House]] first broadcast on May 16, 2006, featured a teenage victim of Hurricane Katrina at the center of the [[Who's Your Daddy? (House)|main medical storyline]].
