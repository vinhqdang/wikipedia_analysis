The '''Northern Woods and Water Route''' is a {{convert|2400|km|mi|adj=on|spell=Commonwealth|precision=-2| }} route through northern [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]]. As early as the 1950s community groups came together to establish a northern travel route; this was proposed as the Northern Yellowhead Transportation Route. The Northern Woods and Water Route Association was established in 1974, and encouraged promotion of the route with the promise of an increase in tourist travel.<ref name="Route">{{Cite web

Fur traders and early settlers utilised the rivers and [[Red River cart]] roads such as ''Long Trail'' until the early 1900s when the railroad and bush planes supplemented travel to this northern boreal transition area.  Corduroy roads provided a means for early land vehicles to cross over muskeg and swamp.  Horse drawn ploughs filled low areas, settlers hauled gravel and cleared bush for the road ways surveyed along high elevations following lake and river shore lines.  Municipalities would grade and gravel roads providing transportation between trading centres.  The all weather road arrived alongside of the NWWR association's impetus for a travel and tourism corridor along the northern area of the western provinces.  Traffic volume along the route is a major factor to determine highway classification, surface type, and construction upgrades.

==Travel Route==
===British Columbia===
[[File:Dawson Creek Art Gallery.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Dawson Creek, British Columbia]] ]]  In British Columbia (BC), the route starts within {{km to mi|num=17.6|abbr=no|spell=Commonwealth|precision=1|wiki=yes }} of the BC and Alberta (AB) border in [[Dawson Creek]] at the intersection of [[British Columbia Highway 2|BC Hwy 2]] and [[British Columbia Highway 49|British Columbia Spirit River Highway 49]] west.  The northern section of BC Hwy 97 is the [[Alaska Highway]], and the southern sections are the Okanagan Highway, Cariboo Highway, and John Hart Highway from south to north, as well, BC Hwy 2 is known as Tupper Highway.  The [[British Columbia Highway 49|British Columbia Spirit River Highway 49]] is the route designated in BC as the NWWR. {{Clear}}

===Alberta===
The NWWR continues east into Alberta on [[Alberta Highway 49|Highway 49]], the Spirit River Highway.  Alberta Highway 49 contributes {{km to mi|num=19.5|abbr=no|spell=Commonwealth|precision=1|}} to the NWWR in northwestern Alberta between Donnelly and the Alberta and BC border. The town of [[Spirit River, Alberta|Spirit River's]] population is just over 1,000 and is supported by agriculture and the oil and gas industry creating an annual average daily traffic (AADT) near Spirit River that is about 2,000 vehicles per day vpd.<ref name="ABVolume">{{Cite web

[[File:Borealforest.jpg|thumb|upright|Boreal forest]]
The ''Long Trail'' followed the Peace River {{mi to km|num=100|abbr=no|spell=Commonwealth|precision=2|wiki=yes}}530 across northern AB.  As the flow of traffic increased due to the fur trade industry along the Long Trail, stopping places developed providing rest and food for travelers.  In 1923, the three routes out of Lac La Biche were to the west, which corresponds to the route of AB Hwy 55 along the south shores of Lesser Slave Lake. Edmonton or Saddle Lake trail departed to the south, which would be the initial stages of AB Hwy 55 out of Lac La Biche.<ref name="Spirit"/>   Heart Lake trail traveled northeast from Lac La Biche, which would form a base for secondary AB Hwy 858.  Work was done on the Athabaska Trail to make it passable for motor traffic as many roads had been graded.<ref>{{Cite book
