'''Henry Seymour Kaplan''' MD (born in Chicago on April 24, 1918, died in San Francisco on February 4, 1984) was a [[radiologist]] who pioneered in [[radiation therapy]] and [[radiobiology]].

Together with [[Edward Ginzton]], he invented the first medical [[linear accelerator]] in the [[Western hemisphere]] while he worked at the [[Stanford University Medical Center]] of [[Stanford University]]. The six million volt machine was first used in 1955, six months after another model was first used in England.

The first patient treated by Dr. Kaplan was Gordon Isaacs, who suffered from [[retinoblastoma]] of his right eye, and the disease threatened his left eye. The patient survived into adulthood with normal vision in his left eye. His main focus was on [[Hodgkin's disease]], which was fatal before radiation therapy was used.

Kaplan earned his degree from [[Rush Medical College]] in Chicago, after which he trained at the [[University of Minnesota]], [[Yale University]] and the [[National Cancer Institute]]. He once said he became interested in oncology after his father died of [[lung cancer]], the same disease which killed Dr. Kaplan, a non-smoker.

In 1969, he became the first physician credited with the [[Atoms for Peace Prize]]. He was the first radiologist elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1972. In 1979, he received the Charles F. Kettering Prize from the [[General Motors]] Cancer Research Foundation.
