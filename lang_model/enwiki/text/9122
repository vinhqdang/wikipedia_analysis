'''Baden-Powell House''', colloquially known as '''B-P House''', is a [[Scouting]] hostel and conference centre in [[South Kensington]], [[London]], which was built as a tribute to [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Lord Baden-Powell]], the founder of Scouting. The house, owned by [[The Scout Association]], hosts a collection of Baden-Powell memorabilia, including the original Baden-Powell painting by [[David Jagger]], Baden-Powell's ''[[wikisource:Last message to scouts|Last Message to Scouts]]'', and a granite statue by [[Don Potter]].

The building committee, chaired by [[Harold Gillett|Sir Harold Gillett]], [[Lord Mayor of London]], purchased the site in 1956, and assigned [[Ralph Tubbs]] to design the house in the [[modern architecture|modern architectural]] style. The Foundation Stone was laid in 1959 by World Chief Guide [[Olave Baden-Powell|Olave, Lady Baden-Powell]], and it was opened in 1961 by [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. The largest part of the <U+00A3>400,000 cost was provided by the Scout Movement itself. Over the years, the house has been refurbished several times, so that it now provides modern and affordable lodging for [[Scouting|Scouts]], [[Girl Guides|Guides]], and their family, staying in London.

|<small> ''Baden-Powell himself has gone, but his Movement remains and grows&mdash;a memorial more enduring than stone or steel. It is, however, fitting that, here in England, where he started it, there should be a house, bearing his name and serving the needs of the Movement, which can express our gratitude to him in a practical way.''</small>

Acting on a 1942 initiative by [[Chief Scout]] [[Arthur Somers-Cocks, 6th Baron Somers|Lord Somers]], a formal Baden-Powell House Committee was established by [[The Scout Association]] in 1953 under the direction of [[Harold Gillett|Sir Harold Gillett]], later [[Lord Mayor of London]]. The committee's directive was to build a [[hostel]] to provide [[Scout]]s a place to stay at reasonable cost while visiting [[London]]. For this purpose, in 1956 the committee purchased a bombed-out property at the intersection of [[Cromwell Road]] and [[Queen's Gate]] at a cost of [[<U+00A3>]]39,000.<ref name="wood"/>

The [[Scouting|Scout Movement]] raised the major part of the funding of <U+00A3>400,000 for building and furnishing the building between 1957 and 1959.  Money was raised through public appeals supported by publication in Scout Movement magazines, a collection of donations in 15,000 brick-shaped boxes, and 5,000 appeal letters signed personally by then Chief Scout [[Thomas Corbett, 2nd Baron Rowallan|Lord Rowallan]].<ref name="wood"/>

In a celebration on [[1959-10-17]] the Foundation Stone was laid by the World Chief Guide [[Olave Baden-Powell|Olave, Lady Baden-Powell]], with Lord Mayor Sir Harold Gillett, the new Chief Scout [[Charles Maclean of Duart, Baron Maclean|Sir Charles Maclean]], and 400 other guests in attendance. A casket was buried under the foundation stone which held 1959 Scout mementoes, stamps, coins, photographs, etc., and a programme of the Foundation Stone Laying Ceremony.<ref name="wood" />

With 142 [[Queen's Scout]]s as Guard of Honour, and live broadcast by the BBC (commentator [[Richard Dimbleby]]), Baden-Powell House was opened on [[1961-07-12]] by [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. Afterwards, the Queen toured the house with the Chief Scout and the president of The Scout Association, [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]], her uncle. A black marble panel with gold lettering was put on the balcony in the hall to commemorate the event.<ref name="wood" />

The house was designed by the architect [[Ralph Tubbs]] in 1956, whose works included the [[Dome of Discovery]], the highlight of the 1951 [[Festival of Britain]]. Tubbs' floor plans and a model of his design were displayed during a fundraising campaign and exhibition on [[1957-02-21]] in the Egyptian Hall of the [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]].<ref name="wood"/><ref name="20cs">{{cite web | url=http://www.c20society.org.uk/docs/building/granada.html | title = The Twentieth Century Society, Building of the Month February 2005 | accessdate = 2006-07-08}}</ref>

The six storied Baden-Powell House is designed in the [[modern architecture|modern]] [[architectural style]], as pioneered by the Swiss architect [[Le Corbusier]] from the late 1920s onwards, and predominating in the 1950s. At Baden-Powell House, Tubbs made the first floor overhang the ground floor, a Le&nbsp;Corbusier architectural design choice to free the building from the ground, such as seen in his [[Pavillon Suisse]] at the [[Cit<U+00E9> Internationale Universitaire de Paris|Cit<U+00E9> Internationale Universitaire]] in [[Paris]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.archivision.com/analog/screen/P/1A1-LC-PS.jpg | title = Images of the Pavillon Suisse | accessdate = 2006-07-05}}</ref> Additionally, Le&nbsp;Corbusier's [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]] priory in [[Lyon]] shows two floors of monks cells with small windows, [[cantilever]]ed over the more open floors below, another design choice used by Tubbs in the [[facade]] of Baden-Powell House.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.washington.edu/ark2/archtm/MLC127.html | title = La Tourette Monastery | accessdate = 2006-07-05 }}</ref> While Tubbs created Baden-Powell House in the modern architecture style of Le&nbsp;Corbusier, he used more architectural restraint and his own design choices, such as making the main visible building component brick rather than concrete. Tubbs' heavier evolution of Le&nbsp;Corbusier's style was popular in England throughout the post-war years until replaced by the [[Brutalist]] style in the later 1960s.<ref name="cropplestone">{{cite book | last = Cropplestone |first = Trewin | year =  1963 | title = World Architecture | publisher = Hamlyn | pages = Pages 331-333, caption 1002 and onward to 341 }}</ref> 

Baden-Powell House was built to Tubbs' design by Harry Neal Ltd, for which they received the 1961 Gold Medal of the [[Worshipful Company of Tylers and Bricklayers]].<ref name="wood"/> At the opening, the house received the building design award for <U+2018>The building of most merit in London.'<ref name="factsheet">{{cite web | title = Scoutbase Fact Sheet on Baden-Powell House |

Thirty-five years after its opening, Baden-Powell House was refurbished in a six-month <U+00A3>2&nbsp;million programme, providing all modern amenities such as private facilities for all rooms, double glazing, and air conditioning, as well as enhancing conference facilities for large and small events. Upon completion of the programme, the house was opened by the president of The Scout Association, [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]] on [[1997-06-05]]. In 2002 a [[Starbucks]] coffee and sandwich bar was opened, as well as an outdoor roof garden adjacent to the meeting conference rooms on the second floor.<ref name="factsheet"/><ref name="passingyears">{{cite web | title = The Passing years, Milestones in the progress of Scouting | url=http://www.scouts.org.uk/aboutus/fs295306.pdf | publisher = [[The Scout Association]] | accessdate = 2006-05-01 | format=PDF}}</ref>

Since Baden-Powell House was intended as a tribute to Baden-Powell, a notable collection of Baden-Powell memorabilia has always been on display for visitors in 'The story of B-P' exhibition. This includes many drawings and letters by Baden-Powell himself, such as the original of his ''[[wikisource:Last message to scouts|Last Message to Scouts]]'', ''Laws for me when I am old'' and several [[first edition]]s of his books. The exhibition also displays the original painting by [[David Jagger]], as presented to Baden-Powell on [[1929-08-29]] at the 'Coming of Age' 21st [[World Jamboree]].<ref name="wood"/> This painting, a personal favourite of Baden-Powell, is often used in publications throughout the Scout movement.<ref name="scoutshop">{{cite web | url=http://www.scouting.outdoors.ltd.uk/acatalog/stationary.htm | title = Example of Jagger's painting on scout merchandise | accessdate = 2006-07-06 }}</ref> A facsimile of the famous painting is on display in the Geneva headquarters building of the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]].<ref name="pinetree">{{cite web | title = Robert Baden-Powell | publisher = Pinetree Web | url=http://www.pinetreeweb.com/B-P.htm | accessdate = 2006-05-01 }}</ref> 

The exhibition was augmented in 1971 by a bust of Baden-Powell, unveiled by Olave, Lady Baden-Powell. On the exhibition's 25th anniversary in 1986, the Duke of Kent re-opened the exhibition in a new setting.<ref name="factsheet" /> The Baden-Powell House regularly hosts temporary exhibitions on Scouting subjects, including (in 1976) an exhibition of [[stamp collecting|Scouting stamps]], [[book collecting|Scout book]] exhibitions, etc.<ref name="wood"/>

As an introductory part of the collection, a nearly 3&nbsp;meter high statue of Baden-Powell has been erected in front of Baden-Powell House, the only [[granite]] statue in London. The sculptor was Baden-Powell's personal friend [[Don Potter]]. It was unveiled on [[1961-07-12]] by the Duke of Gloucester, as part of the official opening of the house.<ref name="wood"/>

The hostel and conference centre is entered through a wide glazed [[atrium]] which serves as a large [[foyer]] containing the cafe and the exhibition centre. From the atrium the large hall is reached which can serve as as an [[auditorium]] with seating for up to 300 people. The first floor has a [[restaurant]] seating 100 guests; the second floor has meeting rooms, and conference facilities for groups up to 80 delegates per room. The upper floors contain 180 hostel bedrooms. Baden-Powell House was designed specifically for members of the Scout Movement. Nonetheless, it has always been fully open to family members of Scouts at reduced prices and to the general public at competitive commercial rates. In an average year, 30&nbsp;thousand people spend the night, and 100&nbsp;thousand meals are served in the restaurant.<ref name="factsheet"/> Souvenir badges and other Baden-Powell House merchandise can be purchased from the reception desk.

From 1974 to 2001, Baden-Powell House was the [[headquarter]]s of The Scout Association, for which a dedicated extension to the house was completed in 1976. In April 2001 the headquarters formally moved to new accommodation at [[Gilwell Park]], but Baden-Powell House still facilitates various departments of The Scout Association. As the owner of Baden-Powell House, The Scout Association receives a net income out of the revenues of approximately <U+00A3>1.5&nbsp;million.<ref name="factsheet" /><ref>{{cite book | first = John | last = Bevan | title = Annual report & accounts 2000&ndash;2001 | publisher = [[The Scout Association]] | date = 2001 }}</ref><ref name="annreport">{{cite book | first = John | last = Asplin | title = Join the adventure.
