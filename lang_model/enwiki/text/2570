== Summary ==
'''The Elmezzi Graduate School of Molecular Medicine''' is a unique program that confers the PhD degree in Molecular Medicine to highly trained young physicians who wish to pursue careers in biomedical research. <ref>{{cite web|title=Elmezzi Graduate School of Molecular Medicine|url=http://www.elmezzigraduateschool.org/|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref>  <ref>{{cite web|title=Feinstein Institute announces Elmezzi Graduate School|url=http://www.feinsteininstitute.org/Feinstein/gradschool|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref>   This graduate school provides the grounding for the Department of Molecular Medicine<ref>{{cite web|title=Department of Molecular Medicine|url=http://medicine.hofstra.edu/department/molecularmed/index.html|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref> for Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine at [[Hofstra University]]..  It is a registered non-profit organization. <ref>{{cite web|title=GuideStar|url=http://www2.guidestar.org/organizations/11-3284934/elmezzi-graduate-school-molecular-medicine.aspx|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref>  <ref>{{cite web|title=Razoo|url=http://www.razoo.com/story/North-Shore-Lij-Graduate-School-Of-Molecular-Medicine|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref>

==Mission==
To provide superior academic training of physicians to discover and understand the causes of human diseases and to rapidly and effectively translate this information into diagnostic and therapeutic solutions.

==Vision==
To train the next generation of leaders in the field of translational research.

== History ==
The Elmezzi Graduate School is part of the [[North Shore-LIJ Health System]] and a sister organization to the [[Feinstein Institute for Medical Research]] in Manhasset, NY.  It became part of the Health System and Feinstein Institute in 2011 and was renamed from [[Picower Graduate School Of Molecular Medicine]] to the Elmezzi Graduate School of Molecular Medicine in 2008 due to a $15 million dollar donation<ref name="Reuters press release">{{cite web|title=North Shore-LIJ Graduate School of Molecular Medicine Renamed in Recognition of $15M Donation From the Thomas and Jeanne Elmezzi Private Foundation|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/01/15/idUS174492+15-Jan-2008+PRN20080115|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title =$15M Donation to Support North Shore-LIJ Graduate School|url=http://www.northshorelij.com/NSLIJ/01142008|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref> to endow the graduate school from the Thomas and Jeanne Elmezzi Private Foundation<ref>{{cite web|title=Thomas and Jeanne Elmezzi Foundation|url=http://elmezzi.org/?page_id=15|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref> .  Biomedical research in the [[North Shore-LIJ Health System]] has been vital within its two major academic medical center - [[North Shore University Hopsital]] and [[Long Island Jewish Medical Center]] since their establishment in the early 1950's.  With continued growth, research through the system would become part of the [[Feinstein Institute for Medical Research]].  The Feinstein opened in 1999 to facilitate disease-oriented basic and clinical research.

Currently, more than 125 investigators and clinical scientists are enrolled in the Institute, conducting research in autoimmunity, rheumatology, oncology, immunology and inflammation, genetics, psychiatry, neurology, surgery, obstetrics/gynecology and many other specialties. Through its connection to the hospital system, the Elmezzi Graduate School and The Feinstein Institute bridge the gap between biomedical research and patient care, accessing hundreds of thousands of patients in the health system's 15 hospitals, four long-term care facilities, three trauma centers, six home health agencies and dozens of outpatient facilities. The scientists of the Institute and the students of the graduate school collaborate with clinicians (physicians, dentists, medical students, fellows and residents) throughout the system to identify critical unanswered questions relating to diseases treated in the hospitals. These questions are developed into research to shed light on basic biological processes underlying disease.
