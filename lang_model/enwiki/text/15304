'''''Hard Times <U+2013> For These Times''''' (commonly known as '''''Hard Times''''') is the tenth novel by [[Charles Dickens]], first published in 1854. The book appraises English society and is aimed at highlighting the social and economic pressures of the times.

==Background==
''Hard Times'' is unusual in several respects. It is by far the shortest of Dickens' novels, barely a quarter of the length of those written immediately before and after it.<ref>Phillip Collins, introduction to ''Hard Times''</ref> Also, unlike all but one of his other novels, ''Hard Times'' has neither a preface nor illustrations. Moreover, it is his only novel not to have scenes set in London.<ref>Philip Collins, introduction to ''Hard Times'', Everyman's Library, 1992</ref> Instead the story is set in the fictitious [[Victorian Era|Victorian]] industrial Coketown, a generic Northern English mill-town, in some ways similar to [[Manchester]], though smaller. Coketown may be partially based upon 19th-century [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]].

One of Dickens's reasons for writing ''Hard Times'' was that sales of his weekly periodical, ''[[Household Words]]'', were low, and it was hoped its publication in installments would boost circulation <U+2013> as indeed proved to be the case. Since publication it has received a mixed response from critics. Critics such as [[F. R. Leavis]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], and [[Thomas Macaulay]] have mainly focused on Dickens's treatment of trade unions and his post<U+2013>[[Industrial Revolution]] pessimism regarding the divide between capitalist mill owners and undervalued workers during the Victorian era.

==Prevalence of utilitarianism==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
The [[List of Utilitarians|Utilitarians]] were one of the targets of this novel. [[Utilitarianism]] was a prevalent school of thought during this period, its founders being [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[James Mill]], father to political theorist [[John Stuart Mill]]. Theoretical Utilitarian ethics hold that promotion of general social welfare is the ultimate goal for the individual and society in general: "the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number of people." Dickens believed that in practical terms, the pursuit of a totally rationalised society could lead to great misery.

Bentham's former secretary, [[Edwin Chadwick]], helped design the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|Poor Law of 1834]], which deliberately made workhouse life as uncomfortable as possible. In the novel, this is conveyed in Bitzer's response to Gradgrind's appeal for compassion.

Dickens was appalled by what was, in his interpretation, a selfish philosophy, which was combined with materialist ''laissez-faire'' capitalism in the education of some children at the time, as well as in industrial practices. In Dickens's interpretation, the prevalence of utilitarian values in educational institutions promoted contempt between mill owners and workers, creating young adults whose imaginations had been neglected, due to an over-emphasis on facts at the expense of more imaginative pursuits.

Dickens wished to satirise radical Utilitarians whom he described in a letter to [[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]] as "see[ing] figures and averages, and nothing else." He also wished to campaign for reform of [[List of topics on working time and conditions|working conditions]]. Dickens had visited factories in [[Manchester]] as early as 1839, and was appalled by the environment in which workers toiled. Drawing upon his own childhood experiences, Dickens resolved to "strike the heaviest blow in my power" for those who laboured in horrific conditions.

John Stuart Mill had a similar, rigorous education to that of Louisa Gradgrind, consisting of analytical, logical, mathematical, and statistical exercises. In his twenties, Mill had a nervous breakdown, believing his capacity for emotion had been enervated by his father's stringent emphasis on analysis and mathematics in his education. In the book, Louisa herself follows a parallel course, being unable to express herself and falling into a temporary depression as a result of her dry education.

==Publication==
The novel was published as a serial in Dickens's weekly publication, ''[[Household Words]]''. Sales were highly responsive and encouraging for Dickens who remarked that he was "Three parts mad, and the fourth delirious, with perpetual rushing at ''Hard Times''". The novel was serialised, in twenty weekly parts, between 1 April and 12 August 1854. It sold well, and a complete volume was published in August, totalling 110,000 words. Another related novel, ''[[North and South (1855 novel)|North and South]]'' by [[Elizabeth Gaskell]], was also published in this magazine.

==Adaptations==
The novel was adapted as a 1915 silent film, ''[[Hard Times (1915 film)|Hard Times]]'', directed by [[Thomas Bentley]].

''Hard Times'' has been adapted twice for BBC Radio, first in 1998 starring [[John Woodvine]] as Gradgrind, [[Tom Baker]] as Josiah Bounderby and [[Anna Massey]] as Mrs. Sparsit, and again in 2007 starring [[Kenneth Cranham]] as Gradgrind, [[Philip Jackson (actor)|Philip Jackson]] as Bounderby, [[Alan Williams (British actor)|Alan Williams]] as Stephen, [[Becky Hindley]] as Rachael, [[Helen Longworth]] as Louisa, [[Richard Firth]] as Tom and [[Eleanor Bron]] as Mrs. Sparsit.

The novel has also been adapted twice as a mini-series for British television, once in 1977 with [[Patrick Allen]] as Gradgrind, [[Timothy West]] as Bounderby, [[Rosalie Crutchley]] as Mrs. Sparsit and [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] as Harthouse, and again in 1994 with [[Bob Peck]] as Gradgrind, [[Alan Bates]] as Bounderby, [[Dilys Laye]] as Mrs. Sparsit, [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]] as Stephen, [[Harriet Walter]] as Rachael and [[Richard E. Grant]] as Harthouse.

==Synopsis==
The novel follows a classical tripartite structure, and the titles of each book are related to ''Galatians'' 6:7, "For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap." Book I is entitled "Sowing", Book II is entitled "Reaping", and the third is "Garnering."

===Book I: Sowing===
[[Gradgrind|Mr. Gradgrind]], whose voice is "dictatorial", opens the novel by stating "Now, what I want is facts" at his school in Coketown. He is a man of "facts and calculations." He interrogates one of his pupils, Sissy, whose father is involved with the circus, the members of which are "Fancy" in comparison to Gradgrind's espousal of "Fact." Since her father rides and tends to horses, Gradgrind demands from Sissy the definition of 'horse'. She is rebuffed for not being able to define a horse factually; her classmate Bitzer does, however, provide a zoological profile and factual definition. Sissy does not learn easily, and is censured for suggesting that she would carpet a floor with pictures of flowers: "So you would carpet your room <U+2013> or your husband's room, if you were a grown woman, and had a husband <U+2013> with representations of flowers, would you? Why would you?" She is taught to disregard Fancy altogether. It is Fancy vs. Fact.

Louisa and Thomas, two of Mr. Gradgrind's children, pay a visit after school to the touring circus run by Mr. Sleary, only to meet their father, who is disconcerted by their trip since he believes the circus to be the bastion of Fancy and conceit. With their father, Louisa and Tom trudge off in a despondent mood. Mr. Gradgrind has three younger children: Adam Smith, (after [[Adam Smith|the famous theorist]] of laissez-faire policy), Malthus (after Rev. [[Thomas Malthus]], who wrote ''An Essay on the Principle of Population'', warning of the dangers of future overpopulation), and Jane.

[[Image:Gradgrindapprehendshischildren.jpg|thumb|Gradgrind apprehends Louisa and Tom, his two eldest children, at the [[circus]].]]

Josiah Bounderby, "a man perfectly devoid of sentiment", is revealed as Gradgrind's boss. Bounderby is a manufacturer and mill owner who is affluent as a result of his [[Entrepreneur|enterprise]] and [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Bounderby is what one might call a "self-made man" who has risen from the gutter. He is not averse to giving dramatic summaries of his childhood, which terrify Mr. Gradgrind's wife <U+2013> she is often rendered insensate by these horrific stories. He is described in an acerbic manner as being "the Bully of Humility."

Mr. Gradgrind and Bounderby visit the public-house where Sissy resides to inform her that she cannot attend the school any more due to the risk of her ideas propagating in the class. Sissy meets the two collaborators, informing them her father has abandoned her not out of malice, but out of desire for Sissy to lead a better life without him. This was the reasoning behind him enlisting her at Gradgrind's school and Gradgrind is outraged at this desertion. At this point members of the circus appear, fronted by their manager, Mr. Sleary. Mr. Gradgrind gives Sissy a choice: either to return to the circus and forfeit her education, or to continue her education and never to return to the circus. Sleary and Gradgrind both have their say on the matter, and at the behest of Josephine Sleary she decides to leave the circus and bid all the close friends she had formed farewell, hoping she may one day be re-united with her father.

Back at the Gradgrind house, Tom and Louisa sit down and discuss their feelings, however repressed they seem to be. Tom, already at this present stage of education, finds himself in a state of dissatisfaction, and Louisa also expresses her discontent at her childhood while staring into the fire. Louisa's ability to wonder, however, has not been entirely extinguished by her rigorous education based on Fact.

We are introduced to the workers at the mills, known as the "Hands." Amongst them is a man named Stephen Blackpool or "Old Stephen" who has led a toilsome life. He is described as a "man of perfect integrity." He has ended his day's work, and his close companion Rachael is about somewhere. He eventually meets up with her, and they walk home discussing their day. On entering his house he finds that his drunken wretch of a wife, who has been in exile from Coketown, has made an unwelcome return to his house. She is unwell, and mumbles inebriated remarks to Stephen, who is greatly perturbed by this event.

The next day, Stephen makes a visit to Bounderby to try to end his woeful, childless marriage through divorce. Mrs. Sparsit, Mr. Bounderby's paid companion, is "dejected by the impiety" of Stephen and Bounderby explains that he could not afford to effect an annulment anyway. Stephen is very bewildered and dejected by this verdict given by Bounderby.

Meanwhile, Mr. Gradgrind prepares to talk to his daughter about a "business proposal", but she is seemingly apathetic in his company, and this seems to frustrate Mr. Gradgrind's efforts. He says that a proposal of marriage has been made to Louisa by Josiah Bounderby, who is some 30 years her senior. Gradgrind uses statistics to prove that an age inequity in marriage does not make it unhappy or short. Louisa passively accepts this offer. Bounderby is rendered ecstatic by the news, as is Louisa's mother, who again is so overwhelmed that she is overcome yet again. Sissy is confounded by, but piteous of, Louisa.

Bounderby and Louisa are married, and they set out to honeymoon in Lyons (Lyon), so that Bounderby can observe the progress of his 'Hands' (labourers who work in his factories there). Tom, her brother, bumps into her before they leave. They hug each other, Tom bidding her farewell and promising to look for her after they come back from their honeymoon.

===Book 2: Reaping===
Book Two opens with the attention focused on Bounderby's new bank in Coketown, over which Bitzer and the austere Mrs. Sparsit keep watch at night for intruders or burglars. A dashing gentleman enters, asking for directions to Bounderby's house, as Gradgrind has sent him from London, along with a letter. It is James Harthouse, a languid fellow, who became an MP out of boredom.

Harthouse is introduced to Bounderby, who regales him with improbable stories of his childhood. Harthouse is utterly bored by the blusterous millowner, yet is astounded by his wife, Louisa, and notices her melancholy nature. Louisa's brother Tom works for Bounderby, and he has become reckless and wayward in his conduct, despite his meticulous education. Tom decides to take a liking to James Harthouse, on the basis of his clothes, showing his superficiality. Tom is later debased to animal status, as he comes to be referred to as the "whelp", a denunciatory term for a young man. Tom is very forthcoming in his contempt for Bounderby in the presence of Harthouse, who soaks up all these secretive revelations.

Stephen is called to Bounderby's mansion, where he informs him of his abstention from joining the union led by the orator Slackbridge, and Bounderby accuses Stephen of fealty and of pledging an oath of secrecy to the union. Stephen denies this, and states that he avoided the Union because of a promise he'd made earlier to Rachael. Bounderby is bedevilled by this conflict of interest and accuses Stephen of being waspish. He dismisses him on the spot, on the basis that he has betrayed both employer and union. Later on a bank theft takes place at the Bounderby bank, and Stephen Blackpool is inculpated in the crime, due to him loitering around the bank at Tom's promise of better times to come, the night before the robbery.

Sparsit observes that the relationship between James Harthouse and Louisa is moving towards a near tryst. She sees Louisa as moving down her "staircase", metaphorically speaking. She sets off from the bank to spy upon them, and catches them at what seems to be a propitious moment. However, despite Harthouse confessing his love to Louisa, Louisa is restrained, and refuses an affair. Sparsit is infatuated with the idea that the two do not know they are being observed. Harthouse departs as does Louisa, and Mrs. Sparsit tries to stay in pursuit, thinking that Louisa is going to assent to the affair, though Louisa has not. She follows Louisa to the railway station, assuming that Louisa has hired a coachman to dispatch her to Coketown. Sparsit, however, misses the fact that Louisa has instead boarded a train to her father's house. Sparsit admits defeat and proclaims "I have lost her!" When Louisa arrives at her father's house, she is revealed to be in an extreme state of disconsolate grief. She accuses her father of denying her the opportunity to have an innocent childhood, and says that her rigorous education has stifled her ability to express her emotions. Louisa collapses at her father's feet, into an insensible torpor.

===Book 3: Garnering===
Mrs. Sparsit arrives at Mr. Bounderby's house, and reveals to him the news her surveillance has brought. Mr. Bounderby, who is rendered irate by this news, journeys to Stone Lodge, where Louisa is resting. Mr. Gradgrind tries to disperse calm upon the scene, and reveals that Louisa resisted the temptation of adultery. Bounderby is inconsolable and he is immensely indignant and ill-mannered towards everyone present, including Mrs. Sparsit, for her falsehood. Bounderby finishes by offering the ultimatum to Louisa of returning to him, by 12 o'clock the next morning, else the marriage is forfeited. Suffice it to say, Mr. Bounderby resumes his bachelorhood when the request is not met.

The discomfited Harthouse leaves Coketown, on an admonition from Sissy Jupe, never to return. He submits. Meanwhile, Mr. Gradgrind and Louisa cast suspicions that Tom, the "whelp", may have committed the bank robbery. Stephen Blackpool, who has been absent from Coketown, trying to find mill work under a pseudonym, tries to exculpate himself from the robbery. On walking back to Coketown, he falls down the Old Hell Shaft, an old pit, completing his terminal bad luck in life. He is rescued by villagers, but after speaking to Rachael for the last time, he dies.

Louisa suspects that Tom had a word with Stephen, making a false offer to him, and therefore urging him to loiter outside the bank. Mr. Gradgrind and Sissy concur with this theory and resolve to find Tom, since he is in danger. Sissy makes a plan for rescue and escape, however, and she reveals that she suspected Tom early on during the proceedings. She sends Tom off to the circus that she used to be a part of, namely Mr. Sleary's. Louisa and Sissy travel to the circus; Tom is there, disguised in [[blackface]]. Remorselessly, Tom says that he had little money, and that robbery was the only solution to his dilemma. Mr. Sleary is not aware. The two have feelings of acrimony towards each other. Bounderby dies of a fit in a street one day. Tom dies in the Americas, having begged for penitence in a half-written letter to his sister, Louisa. Louisa herself grows old and never remarries. Mr. Gradgrind abandons his Utilitarian stance, which brings contempt from his fellow MPs, who give him a hard time. Rachael continues to labour while still consistently maintaining her work ethic and honesty. Sissy is the moral victor of the story, as her children have also escaped the desiccative education of the Gradgrind school and grown learned in "childish lore."

==Major characters==

===Mr. Gradgrind===
'''Thomas Gradgrind''' is a utilitarian who is the founder of the educational system in Coketown. "Eminently practical" is Gradgrind's recurring description throughout the novel. He believes in facts, and statistics. Only after his daughter's breakdown does he come to a realisation that things such as poetry, fiction, and other pursuits are not "destructive nonsense."

===Mr. Bounderby===
'''Josiah Bounderby''' is a business associate of Mr. Gradgrind. Given to boasting about being a self-made man, he employs many of the other central characters of the novel. He has risen to a position of power and wealth from humble origins (though not as humble as he claims). He marries Mr. Gradgrind's daughter Louisa, some 30 years his junior, in what turns out to be a loveless marriage. They have no children. Bounderby is callous, self-centred and ultimately revealed to be a liar and fraud.

===Louisa ===
'''Louisa (Loo) Gradgrind''', later '''Louisa Bounderby''', is the eldest child of the Gradgrind family. She has been taught to suppress her feelings and finds it hard to express herself clearly, saying as a child that she has "unmanageable thoughts."  After her unhappy marriage, she is tempted to adultery by James Harthouse, but resists him and returns to her father. Her rejection of Harthouse leads to a new understanding of life and of the value of emotions and the imagination. She reproaches her father for his dry and fact-based approach to the world and convinces him of the error of his ways.

===Sissy Jupe===
'''Cecilia (Sissy) Jupe''' is a circus girl of Sleary's circus, as well as a student of Thomas Gradgrind's very strict classroom. Sissy has her own set of values and beliefs which make her seem unintelligent in the Gradgrind household. At the end of the novel, when the Gradgrinds' philosophy of religiously adhering solely to facts breaks down, Sissy is the character who teaches them how to live.

Sissy Jupe is first introduced to the readers as Girl Number Twenty in Gradgrind's classroom. She struggles to keep up with Gradgrind's extreme reliance on the recitation of facts, and therefore is seen as not worthy of the school. Sissy is also representative of creativity and wonderment because of her circus background, and those were things that the Gradgrind children were not allowed to engage in. With the urging of Josiah Bounderby, Mr. Gradgrind goes to inform Sissy's father that she can no longer attend his school.

Gradgrind and Bounderby arrive at the Pegasus' Arms, the Coketown public-house where Sissy, her father, and the rest of Sleary's circus were staying. While Sissy and her father were very close once, Mr. Jupe packed up and abandoned his daughter, leaving Sissy alone. In a moment of compassion, Mr. Gradgrind takes Sissy into his home and gives her a second chance at the school. Sissy continues to fall behind in the school, so Mr. Gradgrind keeps her at home to tend to his invalid wife.

While Sissy is the device of imagination and fantasy in the novel, she also serves as the voice of reason. The reason she cannot grasp the philosophy of Gradgrind's classroom is because she actually has a more realistic view of how the world should be perceived. After Louisa and Mr. Gradgrind come to terms with the fact that their way of life is not working, Sissy is the one they come to; she takes care of Louisa and helps her live a new, happy life.

===Tom===
'''Thomas (Tom) Gradgrind, Junior''' is the oldest son and second child of the Gradgrinds. Initially sullen and resentful of his father's Utilitarian education, Tom has a strong relationship with his sister Louisa. He works in Bounderby's bank (which he later robs), and turns to gambling and drinking. Louisa never ceases to adore Tom, and she aids Sissy and Mr. Gradgrind in saving her brother from arrest.

===Old Stephen===
'''Stephen Blackpool''' is a worker at one of Bounderby's mills. He has a drunken wife who no longer lives with him but who appears from time to time. He forms a close bond with Rachael, a co-worker, whom he wishes to marry. After a dispute with Bounderby, he is dismissed from his work at the Coketown mills and, shunned by his former fellow workers, is forced to look for work elsewhere. While absent from Coketown, he is wrongly accused of robbing Bounderby's bank. On his way back to vindicate himself, he falls down a mine-shaft. He is rescued but dies of his injuries.

===Other characters===
'''Bitzer''' <U+2013> is a very pale classmate of Sissy's who is brought up on facts and taught to operate according to self-interest. He takes up a job in Bounderby's bank, and later tries to arrest Tom.

'''Rachael''' <U+2013> is the friend of Stephen Blackpool who attests to his innocence when he is accused of robbing Bounderby's bank. She is a factory worker, childhood friend of Blackpool's drunken and often absent wife, and becomes the literary tool for bringing the two parallel story lines together at the brink of Hell's Shaft in the final book.

'''Mrs. Sparsit''' <U+2013> is a "classical" widow who has fallen on hard times. She is employed by Bounderby, and is jealous when he marries Louisa, delighting in the belief that Louisa is later about to elope with James Harthouse. Her machinations are unsuccessful and she is ultimately sacked by Bounderby.

'''James Harthouse''' <U+2013> is an indolent, languid, upper-class gentleman, who attempts to woo Louisa.

'''Mrs. Gradgrind''' <U+2013> the wife of Mr. Gradgrind, is an invalid and complains constantly.

==Major themes==
Relating back to Dickens' aim to "strike the heaviest blow in my power," he wished to educate readers about the working conditions of some of the factories in the industrial towns of [[Manchester]], and [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]]. Relating to this also, Dickens wished to confront the assumption that prosperity runs parallel to morality, a notion which is systematically deconstructed in this novel through his portrayal of the moral monsters, Mr. Bounderby and James Harthouse. Dickens was also campaigning for the importance of imagination in life, and for people's life to not be reduced to a collection of material facts and statistical analyses. Dickens's favourable portrayal of the Circus, which he describes as caring so "little for Plain Fact", is an example of this.

===Fact vs. Fancy===
This theme is developed early on, the bastion of Fact being the eminently practical Mr. Gradgrind, and his model school, which teaches nothing but [[Fact]]s. Any [[imaginative]] or [[aesthetic]] subjects are eradicated from the curriculum, but analysis, deduction and mathematics are emphasised. Conversely, Fancy is the opposite of Fact, encompassing fiction, music, poetry, and novelty shows such as Sleary's circus. It is interesting that Mr. Sleary is reckoned to be a fool by the Fact men, but it is Sleary who realises people must be "amuthed" (amused). This is made cognisant by Tom's sybaritic gambling and Louisa, who is virtually [[soul]]less as a young child, and as a married woman. Bitzer, who has adhered to Gradgrind's teachings as a child, turns out to be an uncompassionate [[egotist]].

===Officiousness and spying===
Prying and knowledge is key to several characters, namely Mrs. Sparsit and Mr. Bounderby. Mr. Bounderby spends his whole time fabricating stories about his childhood, covering up the real nature of his upbringing, which is solemnly revealed at the end of the novel. While not a snooper himself, he is undone by Sparsit unwittingly revealing the mysterious old woman to be his own mother, and she unravels Josiah's secrets about his upbringing and fictitious stories. Mr. Bounderby himself superintends through calculating tabular statements and statistics, and is always secretly rebuking the people of Coketown for indulging in conceitful activities. This gives Bounderby a sense of superiority, as it does with Mrs. Sparsit, who prides herself on her salacious knowledge gained from spying on others. Bounderby's grasp for superiority is seen in Blackpool's talks to Bounderby regarding divorce proceedings and a union movement at his factory, accusing him that he is on a quest 'to feast on turtle soup and venison, served with a golden spoon.' All "superintendents" of the novel are undone in one way or another.

===Honesty===
This is closely related to Dickens's typical social commentary, which is a theme he uses throughout his entire ''<U+0153>uvre''. Dickens portrays the wealthy in this novel as being morally corrupt. Bounderby has no moral scruples; he fires Blackpool "for a novelty". He also conducts himself without any shred of decency, frequently losing his temper. He is cynically false about his childhood. Harthouse, a leisured gent, is compared to an "iceberg" who will cause a wreck unwittingly, due to him being "not a moral sort of fellow", as he states himself. Stephen Blackpool, a destitute worker, is equipped with perfect morals, always abiding by his promises, and always thoughtful and considerate of others, as is Sissy Jupe.

==Literary significance & criticism==
[[Image:George bernard shaw.jpg|thumb|[[George Bernard Shaw]] was critical of the book's message]]

[[Literary criticism|Critics]] have had a diverse range of opinions on the novel. The critic [[John Ruskin]] declared ''Hard Times'' to be his favourite Dickens work due to its exploration of important social questions. However, [[Thomas Macaulay]] branded it "sullen socialism", on the grounds that Dickens did not fully comprehend the politics of the time. This point was also made by [[George Bernard Shaw]], who decreed ''Hard Times'' to be a novel of "passionate revolt against the whole industrial order of the modern world." Shaw criticised the novel for its failure to provide an accurate account of [[trade unionism]] of the time, deeming Dickens's character of Slackbridge, the poisonous orator, "a mere figment of middle-class imagination." However, believing it to be very different from Dickens's other novels, he also said: "Many readers find the change disappointing. Others find Dickens worth reading almost for the first time." <ref>George Bernard Shaw, quoted in ''Hard Times: The Dickens Critics'', 1966.</ref>

[[F. R. Leavis]], in ''The Great Tradition'', described the book as essentially a moral fable, and said that 'of all Dickens' works (it is) the one that has all the strengths of his genius <U+2013> that of a completely serious work of art'.<ref>F.R. Leavis, ''The Great Tradition'', 1948</ref> This, however, was a view which he later revised in ''Dickens the Novelist'', which recognised that Dickens's strengths and artistry appeared fully in other works.

[[Walter Allen]], in an introduction to an alternative edition, characterised ''Hard Times'' as being an unsurpassed "critique of industrial society", which was later superseded by works of [[D. H. Lawrence]]. Other writers have described the novel as being, as [[G. K. Chesterton]] commented in his work ''Appreciations and Criticisms'', "the harshest of his stories"; whereas [[George Orwell]] praised the novel (and Dickens himself) for "generous anger."
