The '''Youngstown Ohio Works''' baseball team was a [[minor league baseball|minor league]] club that was known for winning the premier championship of the [[Ohio-Pennsylvania League|Ohio<U+2013>Pennsylvania League]] in 1905,<ref name="ohio-pa-1905">{{cite web | url = http://www.sabr.org/sabr.cfm?a=cms,c,412,5,0 | first = Jim | last = Holl | title = Ohio-Pennsylvania League of 1905 | publisher = Society for American Baseball Research | accessdate = 2007-03-04}}</ref> and for launching the professional career of [[pitcher]] [[Roy Castleton]] a year later.<ref name="Society for American Baseball Research ">{{cite web | url = http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&pid=2264&bid=1194 | first = Craig | last = Lammers | title = Roy Castleton | publisher = Society for American Baseball Research | accessdate = 2007-03-08}}</ref> A training ground for several players and officials who later established careers in [[Major League Baseball]], the team proved a formidable regional competitor and also won the 1906 league championship.

During its brief span of activity, the Ohio Works team faced challenges that reflected common difficulties within the Ohio-Pennsylvania League, including weak financial support for teams.<ref name="sp217">''Spalding's Official Athletic Library Baseball Guide'' (New York: American Sports Publishing Co., 1910), p. 217.</ref> Following a dispute over funding, the team's owners sold the club to outside investors, just a few months before the opening of the 1907 season.<ref name="vindy-yo-2-24-07">{{cite news

The club's strong record and regional visibility spurred the growth of amateur and minor league baseball in the Youngstown area, and the community's minor league teams produced notable players throughout the first half of the 20th century.<ref name="Landolf">{{cite news

Competition among league participants was intense, and games were often raucous affairs. On July 16, 1905, a riot broke out during a contest with a team in neighboring Niles, Ohio. According to a newspaper account, the trouble began when two female fans became involved in a "hair-pulling fight". At one point, two "well-known men" were arrested for "taking an umbrella from a woman and breaking it after she had been annoying them with it". Finally, dozens of fans swarmed into the field, where they "pushed around the umpire and interfered with the defensive play of the Youngstown fielders".<ref name="vind-yo-04-11-99">

In September 1905, the Youngstown Ohio Works won the first league championship, though sources disagree on the club's final record. This confusion may be due to the disorganized nature of the new league, with its sprawling roster of teams.<ref name="ohio-pa-1905">{{cite web | url = http://www.sabr.org/sabr.cfm?a=cms,c,412,5,0 | title = Ohio<U+2013>Pennsylvania League of 1905 | publisher = Society for American Baseball Research | accessdate = 2007-03-04}}</ref> According to the ''Spalding Guide'' (1906), "The failure to furnish official reports was probably due to the clubs being new to a league".<ref name="sp289">''Spalding's Official Athletic Library Baseball Guide'' (New York: American Sports Publishing Co., 1906), p. 289.</ref> Baseball researcher Jim Holl summarizes the varied accounts as follows: "''The Reach Guide'' (1906) credits Youngstown with an 84<U+2013>32 won<U+2013>lost record where the ''Spalding Guide'' of the same year list a 90<U+2013>35 record. The ''Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball'' (1993) tells a third story, giving Youngstown an 88<U+2013>35 mark".<ref name="ohio-pa-1905"/> Despite this uncertainty over the club's record, its championship status was not in dispute, and the team became popularly known as "the Champs".<ref name="vindy-yo-06-19-06">{{cite news

By the outset of the 1906 season, the Ohio<U+2013>Pennsylvania League had trimmed down to a more manageable eight teams. Departing teams included franchises from Barberton, Braddock, Bucyrus, Butler, Canton, Homestead, Kent, Lima, Massillon, McKeesport, Mount Vernon, Niles, Steubenville, Washington, and Wooster. At the same time, the league attracted new teams from [[New Castle, Pennsylvania]], and [[Mansfield, Ohio]].<ref name="Society for American Baseball Research"/>

The Ohio Works team opened with 16 players, three of whom had been part of the club during the 1905 season.<ref name="sportinglife02-17-06">

Early in the season, as the Ohio Works team prepared for a second game with the Zanesville Moguls (close rivals in the 1905 championship games),<ref name="sp289"/> the club manager, Hogan, spoke confidently on their chances of capturing the league pennant. "If the boys go through the season as they are playing now, we will have no trouble winning out", he said to a reporter with ''The Youngstown Daily Vindicator''. "Our pitchers are in good condition and are holding the opposing batsmen to few hits. It is the pitching staff that has saved many a game for us. We have no .350 batters on the club, but any man on it is liable to step in and break up a game".<ref name="vindy-yo-06-19-06"/> A local newspaper confirmed Hogan's assessment of the team, observing that only one player, outfielder Will Thomas, had worked up a [[batting average]] of .306.<ref name="vindy-yo-06-25-1906">{{cite news

At some point, however, disagreements over funding evidently arose between the McDonald brothers and Hogan. On February 18, 1907, the ''Zanesville Signal'' reported that Hogan had received permission from "the Messrs.
