'''Cholangiocarcinoma''' is a medical term denoting a form of [[cancer]] that is composed of [[mutation|mutated]] [[epithelial]] cells (or cells showing characteristics of epithelial [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]]) that originate in the [[bile duct]]s which drain [[bile]] from the [[liver]] into the [[small intestine]]. Other [[biliary tract]] cancers include [[pancreatic cancer]], [[gallbladder cancer]], and cancer of the [[ampulla of Vater]].

Cholangiocarcinoma is a relatively rare [[neoplasm]] that is classified as an [[adenocarcinoma]] (a cancer that forms glands or secretes significant amounts of [[mucin]]s). It has an annual [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] rate of 1<U+2013>2 cases per 100,000 in the Western world,<ref name="Landis">{{cite journal |author=Landis S, Murray T, Bolden S, Wingo P |title=Cancer statistics, 1998 |journal=CA Cancer J Clin |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=6<U+2013>29 |year= 1998|pmid=9449931 |doi=10.3322/canjclin.48.1.6}}</ref> but rates of cholangiocarcinoma have been rising worldwide over the past several decades.<ref name="rising">{{cite journal |author=Patel T |title=Worldwide trends in mortality from biliary tract malignancies |journal=BMC Cancer |volume=2|pages=10 |year= 2002|pmid=11991810 |doi=10.1186/1471-2407-2-10 |pmc=113759}}</ref>

Prominent signs and symptoms of cholangiocarcinoma include abnormal [[liver function]] tests, [[abdominal pain]], [[jaundice]], and [[weight loss]]. [[Pruritis|generalized itching]], [[fever]], and changes in color of [[human feces|stool]] or [[urine]] may also occur. The disease is diagnosed through a combination of [[blood test]]s, imaging, [[endoscopy]], and sometimes surgical exploration, with confirmation obtained after a [[pathologist]] examines cells from the tumor under a [[microscope]]. Known risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma include [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]] (an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts), congenital liver malformations, infection with the parasitic [[liver fluke]]s ''[[Opisthorchis viverrini]]'' or ''[[Clonorchis sinensis]]'', and exposure to [[Thorotrast]] ([[thorium dioxide]]), a chemical formerly used in [[medical imaging]]. However, most patients with cholangiocarcinoma have no identifiable specific risk factors.

Cholangiocarcinoma is considered to be an incurable and rapidly [[Lethality|lethal]] malignancy unless both the primary tumor and any [[metastasis|metastases]] can be fully [[Segmental resection|resected]] (removed surgically). No potentially curative treatment yet exists except surgery, but most patients have [[cancer staging|advanced stage]] disease at presentation and are inoperable at the time of diagnosis. Patients with cholangiocarcinoma are generally managed - though never cured - with [[chemotherapy]], [[radiation therapy]], and other [[palliative care]] measures. These are also used as [[adjuvant#oncology|adjuvant]] therapies (i.e. post-surgically) in cases where resection has apparently been successful (or nearly so). Some areas of ongoing [[medical research]] in cholangiocarcinoma include the use of newer [[targeted therapy|targeted therapies]], (such as [[erlotinib]]) or [[photodynamic therapy]] for treatment, and the techniques to measure the concentration of byproducts of cancer [[stromal cell]] formation in the blood for [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] purposes.

==Staging==
Although there are at least three [[cancer staging|staging systems]] for cholangiocarcinoma (e.g. those of Bismuth, Blumgart, and the [[American Joint Committee on Cancer]]), none have been shown to be useful in predicting survival.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zervos E, Osborne D, Goldin S, Villadolid D, Thometz D, Durkin A, Carey L, Rosemurgy A |title=Stage does not predict survival after resection of hilar cholangiocarcinomas promoting an aggressive operative approach |journal=Am J Surg |volume=190 |issue=5 |pages=810<U+2013>5 |year=2005 |pmid=16226963 |doi=10.1016/j.amjsurg.2005.07.025}}</ref> The most important staging issue is whether the tumor can be [[Segmental resection|surgically removed]], or whether it is too advanced for surgical treatment to be successful.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:Jaundice eye.jpg|thumb|Yellowing of the skin and eyes ([[jaundice]])]]
The most common physical indications of cholangiocarcinoma are abnormal [[liver function tests]], [[jaundice]] (yellowing of the eyes and skin occurring when bile ducts are blocked by tumor), [[abdominal pain]] (30%<U+2013>50%), [[pruritis|generalized itching]] (66%), [[weight loss]] (30%<U+2013>50%), [[fever]] (up to 20%), and changes in [[human feces|stool]] or [[urine]] color.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nagorney D, Donohue J, Farnell M, Schleck C, [[Duane Ilstrup|Ilstrup D]] |title=Outcomes after curative resections of cholangiocarcinoma |journal=Arch Surg |volume=128 |issue=8 |pages=871<U+2013>7; discussion 877<U+2013>9 |year=1993 |pmid=8393652}}</ref><ref>[http://www.surgery.usc.edu/divisions/tumor/pancreasdiseases/web%20pages/BILIARY%20SYSTEM/cholangiocarcinoma.html Bile duct cancer: cause and treatment<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> To some extent, the symptoms depend upon the location of the tumor: patients with cholangiocarcinoma in the extrahepatic bile ducts (outside the liver) are more likely to have jaundice, while those with tumors of the bile ducts within the liver more often have pain without jaundice.<ref name="nakeeb">{{cite journal |author=Nakeeb A, Pitt H, Sohn T, Coleman J, Abrams R, Piantadosi S, Hruban R, Lillemoe K, Yeo C, Cameron J |title=Cholangiocarcinoma.

[[Liver function tests|Blood tests of liver function]] in patients with cholangiocarcinoma often reveal a so-called "obstructive picture," with elevated [[bilirubin]], [[alkaline phosphatase]], and [[gamma glutamyl transferase]] levels, and relatively normal [[transaminase]] levels.

==Risk factors==
[[Image:Clonorchis sinensis LifeCycle.gif|thumb|right|Life cycle of ''[[Clonorchis sinensis]]'', a [[liver fluke]] associated with cholangiocarcinoma]]

Although most patients present without any known risk factors evident, a number of [[risk factor]]s for the development of cholangiocarcinoma have been described. In the Western world, the most common of these is [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]] (PSC), an [[inflammatory disease]] of the bile ducts which is itself closely associated with [[ulcerative colitis]] (UC).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chapman R |title=Risk factors for biliary tract carcinogenesis |journal=Ann Oncol |volume=10 |issue=Suppl 4 |pages=308<U+2013>11 |year= 1999|pmid=10436847}}</ref> Epidemiologic studies have suggested that the lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma for a person with PSC is on the order of 10%<U+2013>15%,<ref>Epidemiologic studies which have addressed the incidence of cholangiocarcinoma in people with primary sclerosing cholangitis include the following:

==Pathophysiology==
Cholangiocarcinoma can affect any area of the bile ducts, either within or outside the liver. Tumors occurring in the bile ducts within the liver are referred to as ''intrahepatic'', those occurring in the ducts outside the liver are ''extrahepatic'', and tumors occurring at the site where the bile ducts exit the liver may be referred to as ''perihilar''. A cholangiocarcinoma occurring at the junction where the left and right hepatic ducts meet to form the [[common bile duct]] may be referred to [[eponym]]ously as a [[Klatskin tumor]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Klatskin G |title=Adenocarcinoma Of The Hepatic Duct At Its Bifurcation Within The Porta Hepatis.

Although cholangiocarcinoma is known have the histological and molecular features of an [[adenocarcinoma]] of epithelial cells lining the biliary tract, the actual cell of origin is unknown. Recent evidence has suggested that the initial transformed cell that generates the primary tumor may arise from a [[pluripotent]] hepatic [[adult stem cell|stem cell]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Roskams T |title=Liver stem cells and their implication in hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma |journal=Oncogene |volume=25 |issue=27 |pages=3818<U+2013>22 |year=2006 |pmid=16799623 |doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1209558}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Liu C, Wang J, Ou Q |title=Possible stem cell origin of human cholangiocarcinoma |journal=World J Gastroenterol |volume=10 |issue=22 |pages=3374<U+2013>6 |year=2004 |pmid=15484322}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sell S, Dunsford H |title=Evidence for the stem cell origin of hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma |journal=Am J Pathol |volume=134 |issue=6 |pages=1347<U+2013>63 |year=1989 |pmid=2474256 |pmc=1879951}}</ref> Cholangiocarcinoma is thought to develop through a series of stages - from early [[hyperplasia]] and [[metaplasia]], through [[dysplasia]], to the development of frank [[carcinoma]] - in a process similar to that seen in the development of [[colon cancer]].<ref name="targeting">{{cite journal |author=Sirica A |title=Cholangiocarcinoma: molecular targeting strategies for chemoprevention and therapy |journal=Hepatology |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=5<U+2013>15 |year=2005 |pmid=15690474 |doi=10.1002/hep.20537}}</ref> [[inflammation|Chronic inflammation]] and obstruction of the bile ducts, and the resulting impaired bile flow, are thought to play a role in this progression.<ref name="targeting"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Holzinger F, Z'graggen K, B<U+00FC>chler M |title=Mechanisms of biliary carcinogenesis: a pathogenetic multi-stage cascade towards cholangiocarcinoma |journal=Ann Oncol |volume=10 |issue=Suppl 4 |pages=122<U+2013>6 |year= 1999|pmid=10436802}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Gores G |title=Cholangiocarcinoma: current concepts and insights |journal=Hepatology |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=961<U+2013>9 |year=2003 |pmid=12717374 |doi=10.1053/jhep.2003.50200}}</ref>

[[Histology|Histologically]], cholangiocarcinomas may vary from [[cellular differentiation|undifferentiated to well-differentiated]].

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Cholangiocarcinoma - high mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of an intrahepatic, i.e. in the liver, cholangiocarcinoma (right of image); benign [[hepatocyte]]s are seen (left of image).  Histologically, this is a cholangiocarcinoma as (1) atypical bile duct-like cells (left of image) extend from the tumor in an interlobular septum (the normal anatomical location of bile ducts), and (2) the tumor has the abundant desmoplastic stroma often seen in cholangiocarcinomas.  A [[portal triad]] (upper-left of image) has a [[histologically]] normal [[bile duct]]. [[H&E stain]].]]
Cholangiocarcinoma is definitively diagnosed from tissue, i.e. it is proven by [[biopsy]] or examination of the tissue excised at surgery. It may be suspected in a patient with [[jaundice#Post-hepatic|obstructive jaundice]]. Considering it as the working diagnosis may be challenging in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC); such patients are at high risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma, but the symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from those of PSC. Furthermore, in patients with PSC, such diagnostic clues as a visible mass on imaging or biliary ductal dilatation may not be evident.

===Blood tests===
There are no specific [[blood test]]s that can diagnose cholangiocarcinoma by themselves. Serum levels of [[carcinoembryonic antigen]] (CEA) and CA19-9 are often elevated, but are not [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitive]] or [[specificity (tests)|specific]] enough to be used as a general [[screening (medicine)|screening]] tool. However, they may be useful in conjunction with [[medical imaging|imaging methods]] in supporting a suspected diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma.<ref>Studies of the performance of serum markers for cholangiocarcinoma (such as carcinoembryonic antigen and CA19-9) in patients with and without primary sclerosing cholangitis include the following:

===Imaging of the biliary tree===
[[Image:ERCP cholangioca.jpg|thumb|right|[[ERCP]] image of cholangiocarcinoma, showing common bile duct stricture and dilation of the proximal common bile duct]]
While abdominal imaging can be useful in the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, direct imaging of the [[bile duct]]s is often necessary. [[Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography]] (ERCP), an [[endoscopy|endoscopic]] procedure performed by a [[gastroenterologist]] or specially trained surgeon, has been widely used for this purpose. Although ERCP is an invasive procedure with attendant risks, its advantages include the ability to obtain [[biopsy|biopsies]] and to place [[stent]]s or perform other interventions to relieve biliary obstruction.<ref name="feldman"/> [[Endoscopic ultrasound]] can also be performed at the time of ERCP and may increase the accuracy of the biopsy and yield information on [[lymph node]] invasion and operability.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sugiyama M, Hagi H, Atomi Y, Saito M |title=Diagnosis of portal venous invasion by pancreatobiliary carcinoma: value of endoscopic ultrasonography |journal=Abdom Imaging |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=434<U+2013>8 |year= 1997|pmid=9157867 |doi=10.1007/s002619900227}}</ref> As an alternative to ERCP, [[percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography]] (PTC) may be utilized.

===Surgery===
[[Image:Cholangiocarcinoma.png|right|thumb|Photograph of cholangiocarcinoma in human liver.]]
[[Surgery|Surgical exploration]] may be necessary to obtain a suitable [[biopsy]] and to accurately [[cancer staging|stage]] a patient with cholangiocarcinoma. [[Laparoscopy]] can be used for staging purposes and may avoid the need for a more invasive surgical procedure, such as [[laparotomy]], in some patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weber S, DeMatteo R, Fong Y, Blumgart L, Jarnagin W |title=Staging Laparoscopy in Patients With Extrahepatic Biliary Carcinoma: Analysis of 100 Patients |journal=Ann Surg |volume=235 |issue=3 |pages=392<U+2013>9 |year=2002 |pmid=11882761 |doi=10.1097/00000658-200203000-00011 |pmc=1422445}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Callery M, Strasberg S, Doherty G, Soper N, Norton J |title=Staging laparoscopy with laparoscopic ultrasonography: optimizing resectability in hepatobiliary and pancreatic malignancy |journal=J Am Coll Surg |volume=185 |issue=1 |pages=33<U+2013>9 |year=1997 |pmid=9208958}}</ref> Surgery is also the only curative option for cholangiocarcinoma, although it is limited to patients with early-stage disease.

===Pathology===
Histologically, cholangiocarcinomas are classically well to moderately differentiated [[adenocarcinoma]]s. [[Immunohistochemistry]] is useful in the diagnosis and may be used to help differentiate a cholangiocarcinoma from, [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] and metastasis of other gastrointestinal tumors.<ref>{{cite journal |author=L<U+00E4>nger F, von Wasielewski R, Kreipe HH |title=[The importance of immunohistochemistry for the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinomas] |language=German |journal=Pathologe |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=244<U+2013>50 |year=2006 |pmid=16758167 |doi=10.1007/s00292-006-0836-z}}</ref> [[Cytopathology|Cytological scrapings]] are often nondiagnostic,<ref>Darwin PE, Kennedy A. {{EMedicine|med|343|Cholangiocarcinoma}}</ref> as these tumors typically have a [[desmoplasia|desmoplastic]] stroma and, therefore, do not release diagnostic tumor cells with scrapings.

==Treatment==
Cholangiocarcinoma is considered to be an incurable and rapidly lethal disease unless all the tumors can be fully [[Segmental resection|resected]] (that is, cut out surgically). Since the operability of the tumor can only be assessed during surgery in most cases,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Su C, Tsay S, Wu C, Shyr Y, King K, Lee C, Lui W, Liu T, P'eng F |title=Factors influencing postoperative morbidity, mortality, and survival after resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma |journal=Ann Surg |volume=223 |issue=4 |pages=384<U+2013>94 |year=1996 |pmid=8633917 |doi=10.1097/00000658-199604000-00007 |pmc=1235134}}</ref> a majority of patients undergo exploratory surgery unless there is already a clear indication that the tumor is inoperable.<ref name="feldman"/>

Adjuvant therapy followed by [[liver transplantation]] may have a role in treatment of certain unresectable cases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Heimbach JK, Gores GJ, Haddock MG, ''et al.'' |title=Predictors of disease recurrence following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and liver transplantation for unresectable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma |journal=Transplantation |volume=82 |issue=12 |pages=1703<U+2013>7 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17198263 |doi=10.1097/01.tp.0000253551.43583.d1 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0041-1337&volume=82&issue=12&spage=1703}}</ref>

===Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy===
If the tumor can be removed surgically, patients may receive [[adjuvant#oncology|adjuvant]] [[chemotherapy]] or [[radiation therapy]] after the operation to improve the chances of cure.

==Prognosis==
Surgical resection offers the only potential chance of cure in cholangiocarcinoma.

==Epidemiology==
Cholangiocarcinoma is an [[adenocarcinoma]] of the [[biliary tract]],<ref>http://training.seer.cancer.gov/ss_module13_biliary_tract/unit01_sec01_intro.html Introduction<!-- Bot generated title --></ref> along with [[pancreatic cancer]] (which occurs about 20 times more frequently),<ref>http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2005/results_single/sect_01_table.01.pdf</ref> [[gall bladder]] cancer (which occurs twice as often), and cancer of the [[ampulla of Vater]]. Treatments and clinical trials for pancreatic cancer, being far more prevalent, are often taken as a starting point for managing cholangiocarcinoma, even though the biologies are different enough that chemotherapies can put pancreatic cancer into permanent remission whereas there are no reports in the literature of long-term survival due to chemotherapy or radiation applied to an inoperable cholangiocarcinoma case.

Cholangiocarcinoma is a relatively rare form of cancer; each year, approximately 2,000 to 3,000 new cases are diagnosed in the United States, translating into an annual [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of 1<U+2013>2 cases per 100,000 people.<ref name="Landis"/> [[Autopsy]] series have reported a [[prevalence]] of 0.01% to 0.46%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vauthey J, Blumgart L |title=Recent advances in the management of cholangiocarcinomas |journal=Semin Liver Dis |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=109<U+2013>14 |year=1994 |pmid=8047893 |doi=10.1055/s-2007-1007302}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cancer.gov/statistics/ Cancer Statistics Home Page <U+2014> National Cancer Institute<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> There is a higher prevalence of cholangiocarcinoma in Asia, which has been attributed to endemic chronic parasitic infestation. The incidence of cholangiocarcinoma increases with age, and the disease is slightly more common in men than in women (possibly due to the higher rate of [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]], a major risk factor, in men).<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite journal |author=Henson D, Albores-Saavedra J, Corle D |title=Carcinoma of the extrahepatic bile ducts.
