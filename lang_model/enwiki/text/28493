'''The Kinks''' were<!-- Please do not change. If you would like to change this to "are", please post on the talk page for this article, and add a proper source --> an English rock band formed in [[Muswell Hill]], North London, by brothers [[Dave Davies]] and [[Ray Davies]] in 1963. The Kinks, who rose to fame during the mid-1960s and were part of the [[British Invasion]] of the US, are recognised as one of the most important and influential rock groups of the era.<ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web|title=The Kinks Biography on All Music.com|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4690|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen|accessdate=20 November 2009}}</ref><ref name="Hall Bio">{{cite web|title=The Kinks|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/the-kinks|year=2007|publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|accessdate=20 November 2009}}</ref>

Their music was influenced by a wide range of genres, including [[rhythm and blues]], British [[music hall]], [[Folk music|folk]] and [[country music|country]]. Ray Davies (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and Dave Davies (lead guitar, vocals) remained members throughout the group's 32-year run. Longest serving member [[Mick Avory]] (drums and percussion) was replaced by [[Bob Henrit]] formerly of [[Argent (band)|Argent]] in 1984. Original bassist [[Pete Quaife]] was replaced by [[John Dalton (musician)|John Dalton]] in 1969 and Dalton was in turn replaced by [[Jim Rodford]] in 1978. Keyboardist [[Nicky Hopkins]] accompanied the band during studio sessions in the mid-1960s. In 1969 keyboardist [[John Gosling]] joined the band, making them an official five-piece, while [[Ian Gibbons]] replaced him in 1979, playing in the band until its eventual demise.

The Kinks' subsequent theatrical concept albums met with less success, but the band experienced a revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s with albums ''[[Sleepwalker (The Kinks album)|Sleepwalker]]'', ''[[Misfits (The Kinks album)|Misfits]]'', ''[[Low Budget (album)|Low Budget]]'', ''[[Give the People What They Want]]'' and ''[[State of Confusion]]''. In addition, groups such as  [[Van Halen]], [[the Jam]], [[the Knack]] and [[the Pretenders]] covered their songs, helping to boost the Kinks' record sales. In the 1990s, [[Britpop]] acts such as [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] cited the band as a major influence.<ref name="AllMusic"/> The Kinks broke up in 1996, a result of the commercial failures of their last few albums and creative tension between the Davies brothers.<ref name="Hinman 340<U+2013>342">Hinman, Doug (2004). pp.&nbsp;340<U+2013>342</ref>

=== Formation (1962<U+2013>1963) ===

Visible is a door at left, with a bowfront window at right; various tomato plants are also visible growing in front of the window.|6 Denmark Terrace, the childhood home of the Davies brothers. Visible at right is the front room, where the family's frequent Saturday night parties were held.]]
The Davies brothers were born in suburban [[North London]] on Huntingdon Road, [[East Finchley]], the youngest and only boys among their family's eight children.<ref name="Hinman 6">Hinman, Doug (2004). p.&nbsp;6</ref> Their parents, Frederick and Annie Davies, soon moved the family to 6 Denmark Terrace, [[Fortis Green]], in the neighbouring suburb of [[Muswell Hill]].<ref name="Kitts 1-3">Kitts, Thomas (2007). pp.&nbsp;1<U+2013>5</ref> At home they were immersed in a world of varied musical styles, from the [[music hall]] of their parents' generation to the [[jazz]] and early [[rock and roll]] that their older sisters enjoyed.<ref name="Kitts 1-3"/> These musical experiences centred around nightlong parties held in the front room of their house, which made a great impression on the Davies brothers. Thomas Kitts writes, "The influence of these parties on The Kinks ... is remarkable. Whether consciously or unconsciously, [onstage] it seemed as if Ray was trying to recreate the Saturday night parties of his family's home<U+2014>complete with chaos, beer and singalongs."<ref name="Kitts 5">Kitts, Thomas (2007). p. 5</ref> Both Ray and his brother Dave, younger by almost three years, learned to play guitar, and they played [[skiffle]] and rock and roll together.<ref name="Hinman 6"/>

The brothers attended William Grimshaw Secondary Modern School (later merged with [[Tollington School|Tollington Grammar School]] to become [[Fortismere School]]), where they formed a band, the Ray Davies Quartet, with Ray's friend and classmate Pete Quaife and Quaife's friend John Start. Their debut at a school dance was well received, which encouraged the group to play at local pubs and bars. The band went through a series of lead vocalists; the most notable was [[Rod Stewart]],<ref name="Hinman 8-9">Hinman, Doug (2004). pp.&nbsp;8<U+2013>9</ref> another student at William Grimshaw,<ref>Ewbank, Tim and Stafford Hildred. ''Rod Stewart: The New Biography'' (2005), p.&nbsp;7.</ref> who performed with the group at least once in early 1962.<ref name="allday">Hinman (2004). p.&nbsp;9</ref> He soon formed his own group, Rod Stewart and the Moonrakers, which became a local rival to the Ray Davies Quartet.<ref name="Hinman 8-9"/><ref name="allday"/> In late 1962, Ray Davies left home to study at [[Hornsey College of Art]]. He pursued interests in subjects such as film, [[Sketch (drawing)|sketching]], theatre and music such as jazz and blues. He gained experience as a guitarist with the [[Soho]]-based Dave Hunt Band, a professional group of musicians who played jazz and R&B.<ref name="Kitts 23-30">Kitts, Thomas (2007). pp. 23<U+2013>30</ref><ref name="Hinman 12">Hinman, Doug (2004) p.&nbsp;12</ref> Davies soon quit school and returned to Muswell Hill, where the brothers and Quaife re-formed their old group,<ref name="Kitts 23-30"/> performing under several names, including the Pete Quaife Band, The Bo-Weevils and The Ramrods, before (temporarily) settling on The Ravens.<ref name="Blender"/><ref name="Hinman 9-20">Hinman (2004). pp.&nbsp;9<U+2013>20</ref>

The fledgling group hired two managers, Grenville Collins and Robert Wace, and in late 1963 former pop singer [[Larry Page (British singer and manager)|Larry Page]] signed on as their third. American record producer [[Shel Talmy]] began working with the band, and [[The Beatles]]' promoter, Arthur Howes, was retained to schedule The Ravens' live shows.<ref name="Savage 15-19">Savage, Jon (1984). pp. 15<U+2013>19</ref> The group unsuccessfully auditioned for various record labels until early 1964, when Talmy secured them a contract with [[Pye Records]]. During this period they had acquired a new drummer, Mickey Willet; however, Willet left the band shortly before they signed to Pye.<ref name="Hinman 9-20"/> The Ravens invited Mick Avory to replace him after seeing an advertisement Avory had placed in ''[[Melody Maker]]''.<ref name="Hinman 17-20">Hinman, Doug (2004). pp. 17<U+2013>20</ref> Avory had a background in jazz drumming, and had played one gig with the fledgling [[Rolling Stones]].<ref name="Hinman 17-20"/>

Around this period, the Ravens decided on a new, permanent name: the Kinks. Numerous explanations of the name's genesis have been offered. In [[Jon Savage]]'s analysis, "[They] needed a gimmick, some edge to get them attention. Here it was: 'Kinkiness'<U+2014>something newsy, naughty but just on the borderline of acceptability. In adopting the 'Kinks' as their name at that time, they were participating in a time-honoured pop ritual<U+2014>fame through outrage."<ref name="Savage Name">Savage, Jon (1984). p. 17</ref> Manager Robert Wace related his side of the story: "I had a friend. ... He thought the group was rather fun. If my memory is correct, he came up with the name just as an idea, as a good way of getting publicity. ... When we went to [the band members] with the name, they were ... absolutely horrified. They said, 'We're not going to be called kinky!{{'"}}<ref name="Savage Name"/> Ray Davies' account conflicts with Wace's<U+2014>he recalled that the name was coined by Larry Page, and referenced their "kinky" fashion sense. Davies quoted him as saying, "The way you look, and the clothes you wear, you ought to be called the Kinks."<ref name="Savage Name"/> "I've never really liked the name," Ray stated.<ref name="Savage Name"/>

The Kinks' first single was a cover of the [[Little Richard]] song "[[Long Tall Sally]]". [[Bobby Graham]], a friend of the band,<ref>Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 20</ref> was recruited to play drums on the recording. He would continue to occasionally substitute for Avory in the studio and play on several of the Kinks' early singles.<ref>Hinman, Doug (2004). pp. 20<U+2013>46</ref> "Long Tall Sally" was released in February 1964, but despite the publicity efforts of the band's managers, the single was almost completely ignored.

The Kinks made their first tour of Australia, New Zealand  beginning in January 1965 as part of a package bill that included [[Manfred Mann]] and [[The Honeycombs]].<ref name="All Day 47">Hinman, Doug (2004). p.&nbsp;47</ref> An intensive performing schedule saw them headline other package tours throughout the year with acts such as [[The Yardbirds]] and Mickey Finn.<ref name="Kitts58">Kitts, Thomas (2007). p.&nbsp;58</ref> Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, [[Cardiff]], Wales on 19 May.<ref name="Kitts58"/><ref name="All Day55"/> After finishing the first song, "You Really Got Me", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set.<ref name="Kitts58"/><ref name="All Day55"/> Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate.

A stopover in [[Mumbai|Bombay, India]], during the band's Australian and Asian tour had led Davies to write the song "[[See My Friends]]", released as a single in July 1965.<ref name="Bellman 294">Bellman, Jonathan (1998). p.&nbsp;294</ref> This was an early example of [[crossover music]] and one of the first pop songs of the period to display the direct influence of traditional music from the Indian subcontinent.<ref name="Bellman 294"/> In his autobiography, ''X-Ray'', Davies noted he was inspired to write "See My Friends" after hearing the songs of local fishermen during an early morning walk:

{{quote|I remember getting up, going to the beach and seeing all these fishermen coming along. I heard chanting to start with, and gradually the chanting came a bit closer and I could see it was fishermen carrying their nets out. When I got to Australia I wrote lots of songs, and that one particularly.<ref name="Bellman 294"/>}}

Music historian [[Jonathan Bellman]] argues that the song was "extremely influential" on Davies' musical peers: "And while much has been made of the Beatles' '[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)|Norwegian Wood]]' because it was the first pop record to use a [[sitar]], it was recorded well after the Kinks' clearly Indian 'See My Friends' was released."<ref name="Bellman 294"/> [[Pete Townshend]] of [[The Who]] was particularly affected by the song: {{"'}}See My Friends' was the next time I pricked up my ears and thought, 'God, he's done it again. He's invented something new.' That was the first reasonable use of the drone<U+2014>far, far better than anything the Beatles did and far, far earlier. It was a European sound rather than an Eastern sound but with a strong, legitimate Eastern influence which had its roots in European folk music."<ref name="Savage 58">Savage, Jon (1984). p. 58</ref> In a widely quoted<ref name="Bellman 294">Bellman, Jonathan (1998). p.&nbsp;363</ref><ref name="Bellman 294"/><ref name="Savage 58"/> statement by [[Barry Fantoni]], 1960s celebrity and friend of the Kinks, the Beatles and the Who, he recalled that it was also an influence on The Beatles: "I remember it vividly and still think it's a remarkable pop song. I was with the Beatles the evening that they actually sat around listening to it on a gramophone, saying 'You know this guitar thing sounds like a sitar. We must get one of those.{{'"}}<ref name="Savage 58"/> The song's radical departure from popular music conventions proved unpopular with the band's American following<U+2014>it hit number 11 in the UK, but stalled at number 111 in the US.<ref name="Hinman 62a">Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 62</ref>

Davies later expressed his dissatisfaction with the production, saying, "a bit more care should have been taken with it. I think [producer] [[Shel Talmy]] went too far in trying to keep in the rough edges. Some of the double tracking on that is appalling. It had better songs on it than the first album, but it wasn't executed in the right way. It was just far too rushed."<ref name="Liner Notes"/>

A significant stylistic shift became evident in late 1965, with the appearance of singles like "[[A Well Respected Man]]" and "[[Dedicated Follower of Fashion]]", as well as the band's third album, ''[[The Kink Kontroversy]]'',<ref name="Hall Bio"/> on which [[session musician]] [[Nicky Hopkins]] made his first appearance with the group on keyboards.<ref name="Hinman 68">Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 68</ref> These recordings exemplified the development of Davies' songwriting style, from hard-driving rock numbers toward songs rich in social commentary, observation and idiosyncratic character study, all with a uniquely English flavour.<ref name="Hall Bio"/><ref name="RollinStone"/>

"Sunny Afternoon" was a dry run for the band's next album ''[[Face to Face (The Kinks album)|Face to Face]]'', which displayed Davies' growing ability to craft gentle yet cutting narrative songs about everyday life and people.<ref name="AllMusic"/> Hopkins returned for the sessions to play various keyboard instruments, including piano and [[harpsichord]].

While it was co-written by Ray Davies and recorded by the Kinks, it was also released as a Dave Davies solo single.<ref name="Charts Kinda"/><ref name="SomethingE"/> Overall, however, the album's commercial performance was disappointing, prompting The Kinks to rush out a new single, "[[Autumn Almanac]]", in early October. Backed with "[[Mister Pleasant]]", the single quickly became another Top 5 success for the group. Andy Miller points out that, despite its success, the single marks a turning point in the band's career<U+2014>it would be their last entry into the UK Top Ten for three years: "In retrospect, 'Autumn Almanac' marked the first hint of trouble for The Kinks. This glorious single, one of the greatest achievements of British 60s pop, was widely criticised at the time for being too similar to previous Davies efforts."<ref name=Miller15>Miller, Andy (2003). p. 15.</ref> Nick Jones of ''Melody Maker'' asked, "Is it time that Ray stopped writing about grey suburbanites going about their fairly unemotional daily business? ... Ray works to a formula, not a feeling, and it's becoming rather boring."<ref name=Miller15/> Disc jockey Mike Ahern called the song "a load of old rubbish".<ref name=Miller15/> Dave's second solo single, "[[Susannah's Still Alive]]", was released in the UK on 24 November. It sold a modest 59,000 copies, but failed to reach the Top 10. Miller states that "by the end of the year, The Kinks were rapidly sliding out of fashion."<ref>Miller, Andy (2003). p. 16.</ref>

The venues were largely cabarets and clubs; headlining was [[Peter Frampton]]'s group [[The Herd (UK band)|The Herd]]. "In general, the [[teenybopper]]s were not there to see the boring old Kinks, who occasionally had to endure chants of "We Want The Herd!" during their brief appearances,"<ref name="Miller 27">Miller, Andy (2003). p. 27</ref> commented Andy Miller. The tour proved taxing and stressful<U+2014>Pete Quaife recalled, "It was a chore, very dull, boring and straightforward. ... We only did twenty minutes, but it used to drive me absolutely frantic, standing on stage and playing three notes over and over again."<ref name="Miller 27"/> At the end of June, The Kinks released the single "[[Days (The Kinks song)|Days]]", which provided a minor, but only momentary, comeback for the group. "I remember playing it when I was at Fortis Green the first time I had a tape of it," Ray said. "I played it to Brian, who used to be our [[roadie]], and his wife and two daughters. They were crying at the end of it. Really wonderful<U+2014>like going to Waterloo and seeing the sunset. ...

''Village Green'' eventually morphed into their next album, ''[[The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society]]'', released in late 1968 in the UK.

It included the US Top 40 hit "[[A Rock 'N' Roll Fantasy]]",<ref name="Hinman 218-219"/> which helped make the record another success for the band. Dalton left the band permanently at the end of their UK tour, and Gordon John Edwards soon followed. Ex-[[Argent (band)|Argent]] bassist [[Jim Rodford]] joined the band before the recording of ''[[Low Budget (album)|Low Budget]]'', on which Ray Davies played the keyboard sections. Keyboardist [[Ian Gibbons]] was recruited for the subsequent tour, and soon became a permanent member of the group. Despite the personnel changes, the popularity of the band's records and live shows continued to grow.

Beginning in the late 1970s, bands such as [[the Jam]] ("[[David Watts (song)|David Watts]]"), [[the Pretenders]] ("Stop Your Sobbing", "I Go to Sleep") and [[the Knack]] ("The Hard Way") recorded covers of Kinks songs, which helped bring attention to the group's new releases.<ref name="AllMusic"/><ref name="Hall Bio"/> In 1978, [[Van Halen]] covered "You Really Got Me" for their debut single, a Top 40 U.S. hit (the band later covered "[[Where Have All the Good Times Gone]]", another early Kinks song). The hard rock sound of ''Low Budget'', released in 1979, helped make it the Kinks' second [[gold album]] and highest charting original album in America, where it peaked at number 11.<ref name="AllMusic"/><ref name="Hall Bio"/><ref name="Charts Kinda"/> In 1980, the group's third live album, ''[[One for the Road (The Kinks album)|One for the Road]]'', was produced, along with a video of the same title, bringing the group's concert-drawing power to a peak that would last into 1983.<ref name="AllMusic"/><ref name="Hall Bio"/> Dave Davies also took advantage of the group's improved commercial standing to fulfill his decade-long ambitions to release albums of his solo work. The first was the [[eponym]]ous ''Dave Davies'' in 1980. It was also known by its catalogue number "AFL1-3603" because of its cover art, which depicted Dave Davies as a leather-jacketed piece of price-scanning barcode. He produced another, less successful, solo album in 1981, ''Glamour''.<ref name="Dave Davies">{{cite web|title=Dave Davies|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p16868|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|last=Unterberger|first=Richie|accessdate=27 November 2009}}</ref><ref name="AFLI">{{cite web|title=AFL1-3603|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r66481|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|last=Chrispell|first=James|accessdate=27 November 2009}}</ref>

Davies eventually refused to work with Avory,<ref name="Hinman 300"/> and called for him to be replaced by [[Bob Henrit]], former drummer of [[Argent (band)|Argent]] (of which Jim Rodford had also been a member).<ref name="Hinman 300"/> Avory left the band, and Henrit was brought in to take his place. Ray Davies, who was still on amiable terms with Avory, invited him to manage Konk Studios. Avory accepted, and continued to serve as a producer and occasional contributor on later Kinks albums.<ref name="Hinman 300"/>

Between the completion of ''Return to Waterloo'' and Avory's departure, the band had begun work on ''[[Word of Mouth (The Kinks album)|Word of Mouth]]'', their final Arista album, released in November 1984. As a result it features Avory on three tracks,<ref name="Hinman 300"/> with Henrit and a [[drum machine]] on the rest.<ref name="Rogan 142">Rogan, Johnny (2004). p.&nbsp;142</ref> Many of the songs also appeared as solo recordings on Ray Davies' ''Return to Waterloo'' soundtrack album.<ref name="Return To Music"/> ''Word of Mouth''{{'}}s lead track, "Do it Again", was released as a single in April 1985.

Coinciding with the album's release, the first three books on The Kinks were published.<ref name="Hinman 272">Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 272</ref> ''The Kinks: The Official Biography'', by [[Jon Savage]], drew on extensive interviews with members of the band. Ray Davies had even helped Savage and his agent set up the book deal. However, shortly before the publication date, he tried three times to halt its release. ''The Observer'' reported that "first was an objection to the text, even though the singer had approved it earlier. ... Then there came a threatened injunction ... because of objections to some of the photographs.

=== Decline in popularity and split (1986<U+2013>1996) ===
In early 1986, the group signed with [[MCA Records]] in the United States and London Records in the UK.<ref name="Disc"/><ref name="Rogan 142"/> Their first album for the new labels, ''[[Think Visual]]'', released later that year, was a moderate success, peaking at number 81 on the ''Billboard'' albums chart.<ref name="Charts Kinda"/><ref name="Disc"/><ref name="Rogan 142a">Rogan, Johnny (2004). pp.&nbsp;142<U+2013>154</ref> Songs like the ballad "Lost and Found" and "Working at the Factory" concerned blue-collar life on an assembly line, while the title track was an attack on the very MTV video culture from which the band had profited earlier in the decade.<ref name="Allmusic Think Visual">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r11034|pure_url=yes}}|title=Think Visual|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=27 November 2009}}</ref> The Kinks followed ''Think Visual'' in 1987 with another live album, ''The Road'', which was a mediocre commercial and critical performer.<ref name="Charts Kinda"/> In 1989, The Kinks released ''[[UK Jive]]'', a commercial failure, making only a momentary entry into the album charts at number 122.<ref name="Charts Kinda"/> MCA Records ultimately dropped them, leaving The Kinks scrambling to find a label deal for the first time in over a quarter of a century. Longtime keyboardist Ian Gibbons left the group and was replaced by Mark Haley.<ref name="Hinman 320">Hinman, Doug (2004). pp.&nbsp;300<U+2013>320</ref>

In 1990, their first year of eligibility, the Kinks were inducted into the [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name="Hall Bio"/> Mick Avory and Pete Quaife were present for the award.<ref name="Hall Bio"/><ref name="Hinman 320"/> The induction, however, did not resuscitate The Kinks' stalled career. A compilation from the [[MCA Records]] period was produced in 1991, titled ''[[Lost & Found (1986-1989)]]''. It was primarily released to fulfill contractual obligations, and marked the official end of the group's relationship with MCA.<ref name="Disc"/> The band then signed with [[Columbia Records]] and released the five-song EP ''Did Ya'' in 1991 which, despite being coupled with a new studio re-recording of the band's 1968 British hit "Days", failed to chart.<ref name="Charts Kinda"/><ref name="Disc"/>

The Kinks reverted to a four-piece band for the recording of their first Columbia album, ''[[Phobia (The Kinks album)|Phobia]]'', in 1993.<ref name="Hinman 320"/><ref name="Hinman 325">Hinman, Doug (2004). p.&nbsp;325</ref> Following Mark Haley's departure after the band's sellout performance at the Royal Albert Hall, London, Gibbons rejoined The Kinks for a US tour.<ref name="Hinman 320"/> ''Phobia'' managed only one week in the US ''Billboard'' chart at number 166;<ref name="Charts Kinda"/><ref name="Hinman 320"/> as had by then become usual for the band, it made no impression in the UK.<ref name="Hinman 325"/> One single, "Only a Dream", narrowly failed to reach the British chart. "Scattered", the album's final candidate for release as a single, was announced, followed by TV and radio promotion, but the record was unavailable in stores<U+2014>several months later a small number appeared on the collector market.<ref name="Hinman 325"/> The group was dropped by Columbia in 1994.<ref name="Hinman 325"/> In the same year, the band released the first version of the album ''[[To the Bone (The Kinks album)|To the Bone]]'' on their own [[Konk (recording)|Konk]] label in the UK. This live acoustic album was partly recorded on the highly successful UK tours of 1993 and 1994 and partly in the Konk studio, before a small, invited audience.<ref name="Hinman 340">Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 340</ref> Two years later the band released a new, improved, live double CD set in the USA, which retained the same name and contained two new studio tracks, "Animal" and "To The Bone". The CD set also featured new treatments of many old Kinks hits.<ref name="Hinman 340"/> The record drew respectable press but failed to chart in either the US or the UK.<ref name="Charts Kinda"/><ref name="Hinman 340"/>

The band's profile rose considerably in the mid-1990s, primarily as a result of the "[[Britpop]]" boom.<ref name="AllMusic"/><ref name="Hinman 340"/> Several of the most prominent bands of the decade cited The Kinks as a major influence. Blur frontman [[Damon Albarn]] and Oasis chief songwriter [[Noel Gallagher]] both described The Kinks as having a major impact on their songwriting as well as their overall development as musical artists. Gallagher declared The Kinks the fifth best band of all time.<ref name="Oasis Top 10">{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/oasis/39454|title=Oasis' Noel Gallagher Reveals His Top 10 Bands|work=NME |date=3 September 2008|accessdate=27 November 2009}}</ref> Despite such accolades, the group's commercial viability continued to decline.<ref name="AllMusic"/> They gradually became less active, leading Ray and Dave Davies to pursue their own interests. Each released an autobiography; Ray's ''X-Ray'' was published in early 1995, and Dave responded with his memoir ''Kink'', published a year later.<ref name="Hinman 333">Hinman, Doug (2004). p.&nbsp;333</ref> The Kinks gave their last public performance in mid-1996,<ref name="Hinman 325">Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 325-350</ref> and the group assembled for what would turn out to be their last time together at a party for Dave's 50th birthday. Kinks chronicler and historian Doug Hinman stated, "The symbolism of the event was impossible to overlook. The party was held at the site of the brothers' very first musical endeavour, the Clissold Arms pub, across the street from their childhood home on Fortis Green in North London."<ref name="Hinman 337">Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 337</ref>

=== Solo work and potential reunion (1997<U+2013>present) ===
[[Image:Dave Davies.jpg|right|thumb|220px|alt=A man, wearing blue, plays an electric guitar and gazes down on the ground.|Dave Davies at the Dakota Creek Roadhouse, 2002]]
The band members subsequently focused on solo projects, and Ray and Dave released their own studio albums.<ref name="Hinman 333"/> Talk of a Kinks reunion circulated (including an aborted studio reunion of the original band members in 1999), but neither Ray nor Dave Davies showed much interest in playing together again.<ref name="Hinman 325"/> Meanwhile, former members John Gosling, John Dalton and Mick Avory had regrouped in 1994 and started performing on the oldies circuit along with guitar-player/singer [[Dave Clarke (musician)|Dave Clarke]] as [[The Kast Off Kinks]].<ref name="Allmusic Mick Avory">{{cite web|title=Mick Avory|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p53104|pure_url=yes}}|last=Eder|first=Bruce|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=27 November 2009}}</ref> Gosling and Dalton retired in 2008 and were replaced in the band by former Kinks members Jim Rodford and Ian Gibbons. Ray Davies, Pete Quaife and Bob Henrit have occasionally made guest appearances with the group at Kinks fan club conventions.

Ray Davies came out with the solo album ''Storyteller'', a companion piece to ''X-Ray'', in 1998. Originally written two years earlier as a cabaret-style show, it celebrated his old band and his estranged brother.<ref name="Davies"/> Seeing the programming possibilities in his music/dialogue/reminiscence format, the American music television network [[VH1]] launched a series of similar projects featuring established rock artists titled ''[[VH1 Storytellers]]''.<ref name="Davies">{{cite web|title=Ray Davies|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p35394|pure_url=yes}}|last1=Ruhlman|first1=William|last2=Erlewine|first2=Stephen|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=27 November 2009}}</ref> Dave Davies spoke favourably of a Kinks reunion in early 2003, and as the 40th anniversary of the group's breakthrough neared, both of the Davies brothers expressed interest in working together again.<ref name="Hinman 342">Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 342</ref> However, hopes for a reunion were eliminated when in June 2004 Dave suffered a stroke while exiting an elevator, temporarily impairing his ability to speak and play guitar.<ref name=Independent>{{cite news|title=Ray Davies' well-respected legacy|last=McNair|first=James|date=23 September 2008|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/ray-davies-wellrespected-legacy-1709342.html|work=The Independent |accessdate=27 November 2009 | location=London}}</ref> Following Dave's recovery, The Kinks were inducted into the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in November 2005, with all four of the original band members in attendance.

In December 2007, ''[[Record Collector]]'' published an interview with Ray Davies in which he said, "I spoke to Quaife about a month ago and he dearly wants to make another record with me.

In a September 2008 interview with [[BBC Radio 4]], Ray Davies said of a possible reunion, "There is a desire to do it", but that he wouldn't participate if it were a nostalgia act: "The thing that would make me decide 'yes' or 'no' would be whether or not we could do new songs".

In June 2009, Ray Davies told ''[[The Independent]]'' that while a full-fledged reunion was unlikely, "I will continue to play with ex-band members like Mick Avory from time to time.

In separate interviews early in 2011 both Davies brothers spoke positively about a potential reunion. Dave Davies explained, "There's nothing in the pipeline yet, but...we'll see. It's possible."

== Legacy ==
The Kinks are recognised as one of the most important and influential rock acts of the 1960s and early 1980s.<ref name="AllMusic"/><ref name="Hall Bio"/> Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the Kinks "one of the most influential bands of the British Invasion".<ref name="AllMusic"/> Artists influenced by The Kinks include [[punk rock]] groups such as the [[Ramones]],<ref name="Harrington">Harrington, Joe S. ''Sonic Cool: The Life & Death of Rock 'n' Roll'' (2002), p. 165</ref>  [[The Clash]],<ref name="Gracyk">Gracyk, Theodore. ''I Wanna Be Me: Rock Music and the Politics of Identity'' (2001), p. 75</ref> and [[The Jam]], [[New Wave music|New Wave]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] acts like [[Van Halen]] and [[Britpop]] groups such as [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]].<ref name="AllMusic"/> [[Pete Townshend]], guitarist with The Kinks' contemporaries [[The Who]], was particularly influenced by the group's sound: "the Kinks were ... quintessentially English. I always think that Ray Davies should one day be poet laureate. He invented a new kind of poetry and a new kind of language for pop writing that influenced me from the very, very, very beginning."<ref name="Rock Hist">{{cite video|year=1995 |title=The History of Rock 'n' Roll |medium=Television |publisher=Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution |accessdate =13 January 2010}}</ref> Jon Savage wrote that The Kinks were an influence on late-1960s American psychedelic groups, "like [[the Doors]], [[Love (band)|Love]] and [[Jefferson Airplane]]".<ref name="Savage 87"/>

[[Musicology|Musicologist]] Joe Harrington has described the Kinks' influence on the development of hard rock and heavy metal: "{{'}}You Really Got Me', 'All Day and All of the Night' and 'I Need You' were predecessors of the whole three-chord genre ... the Kinks did a lot to help turn rock 'n' roll ([[Jerry Lee Lewis]]) into rock ([[Led Zeppelin]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[the Stooges]])."<ref name="Harrington"/>

== Charts, sales certifications and recognition ==
The Kinks had five Top 10 singles on the US ''Billboard'' chart. Nine of their albums charted in the Top 40.<ref name="Disc"/> In the UK, the group had seventeen Top 20 singles along with five Top 10 albums.<ref name="Rogan, Johnny 2004"/> The [[RIAA]] has certified four of The Kinks' albums as [[gold record]]s. ''[[Greatest Hits!]]'', released in 1965, was certified gold for sales of $1,000,000 on 28 November 1968<U+2014>six days after the release of ''The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society'', which failed to chart worldwide.<ref name="Hinman 121">Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 121</ref> The group would not receive another gold record award until 1979's ''Low Budget''; the 1980 live album ''One For The Road'' followed soon after, and was certified gold on 8 December 1980. ''Give The People What They Want'', released in 1981, received its certification on 25 January 1982, for sales of 500,000 copies.<ref name="Hinman 256">Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 256</ref> [[ASCAP]], the [[Performing rights|performing-rights]] group, presented The Kinks with an award for "One of the Most Played Songs Of 1983" for the hit single "Come Dancing".<ref name="Hinman 272"/>

The group received the [[Ivor Novello Award]] for "Outstanding Service to British Music",<ref name="Hinman, Doug 2004. p. 303"/> and in 1990 the original four members of The Kinks were inducted into the [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name="Hall Bio"/><ref name="Blender"/> The Kinks were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2005.<ref name="UK Music Hall"/>

== Musical style ==
The Kinks initially stayed within the boundaries of genres such as [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[blues]], but soon began experimenting with louder rock and [[hard rock]] sounds<U+2014>due to their pioneering of the field, they have often been labelled as "the original [[Punk rock|punks]]".<ref name="Hinman p. 1">Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 1</ref><ref name="Hall of Fame Rocks">{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/hall-of-fame-anniversary-rocks-on-with-second-all-star-night-20091030|title=Hall of Fame Anniversary Rocks on With Second All-Star Night |author=Ganz, Caryn |date=30 October 2009 |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=8 February 2010}}</ref> Dave Davies became bored with the traditional "clean" guitar style of the period; in search of a louder, more biting sound, he famously split the speaker cone of his Elpico [[amplifier]] (nicknamed "the little green amp"): "I started to get really frustrated [with the amp's sound], and I said, 'I know! I'll fix you!' I got a single-sided Gillette razorblade and cut ... [from the centre to the edge of the] [[Speaker cone|cone]] ... so it was all shredded but still on there, still intact. I played and I thought it was amazing."<ref name="Hunter, Dave">{{Cite journal |last=Hunter |first=Dave |title=Voxes, Vees And Razorblades|work=The Guitar Magazine |date=January 1999}}</ref> The jagged sound of the amplifier was replicated in the studio; the Elpico was plugged into a larger [[Vox AC30]], and the resulting effect became a mainstay in The Kinks' early recordings<U+2014>most notably on "You Really Got Me" and "All Day and All of the Night".<ref name="AllMusic"/>

However, the group soon abandoned its R&B and hard rock leanings. From 1966 onwards,<ref name="AllMusic"/> The Kinks came to be known for their adherence to traditions of English music and culture, during a period when many other British groups dismissed their heritage in favour of American blues, R&B and pop styles.<ref name="AllMusic"/> Ray Davies recalled that at a distinct moment in 1965 he decided to break away from the American scene, and write more introspective and intelligent songs. "I decided I was going to use words more, and say things. I wrote '[[Well Respected Man]]'. That was the first real word-oriented song I wrote. ... [I also] abandoned any attempt to Americanise my accent."<ref name="Hinman">Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 61</ref> The Kinks' allegiance to English styles was strengthened by the ban placed on them by the [[American Federation of Musicians]]. The ban cut them off from the American record buying public, the world's largest musical market,<ref name="AllMusic"/> forcing them to focus on Britain and mainland Europe. The Kinks expanded on their English sound throughout the remainder of the 1960s, fusing music hall and folk, and creating some of the most influential and important music of the period.<ref name="AllMusic"/>

Beginning with ''Everybody's In Show-biz'' (1972), Ray Davies began exploring theatrical concepts on the group's albums; these themes became manifest on the 1973 album ''Preservation Act 1'' and continued through ''Schoolboys In Disgrace'' (1976).<ref name="AllMusic"/> The Kinks found little success with these conceptual works, and reverted to a traditional rock format throughout the remainder of the 1970s. ''Sleepwalker'' (1977), which heralded their return to commercial success, featured a mainstream, relatively slick production style that would become their norm.<ref name="Sleepwalker"/> The band returned to hard rock for ''Low Budget'' (1979), and continued to record within the genre throughout the remainder of their career.<ref name="AllMusic"/>

== Documentation, unreleased material and out-takes ==
The recording histories of contemporary acts were well-documented but little survived from studio archives of the Kinks' 1960s recording history.<ref name="Hinman 4-5">Hinman, Doug (2004). pp. 4<U+2013>5</ref> Ray Davies kept a diary,<ref name="Hinman 4">Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 4</ref> but he had, by 2004, not published it.<ref name="Hinman 4-5"/> Unlike larger record companies like [[EMI]], [[Pye Records]], kept few of the Kinks' session tapes, [[wiping]] or recording over most acetates and out-takes<U+2014>by the mid-1980s.<ref name="Hinman 5"/> From 1971 - and the move to RCA - both documentation and tapes were preserved because, at their own Konk Studios, The Kinks kept creative licence <U+2013> but "until and unless there is some access to the vaults of Konk Studios, this aspect of the Kinks' recording legacy will remain far from definitive", Doug Hinman wrote in 2004.<ref name="Hinman 5">Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 5</ref> Later compilation releases, such as [[Picture Book (The Kinks album)|"Picture Book"]], increasingly included previously-unreleased material and commentary.
