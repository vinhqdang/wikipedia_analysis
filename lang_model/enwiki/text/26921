A '''copycat suicide''' is defined as an emulation of another [[suicide]] that the person attempting suicide knows about either from local knowledge or due to accounts or depictions of the original suicide on [[television]] and in other [[mass media|media]].

A spike of emulation suicides after a widely publicized suicide is known as the '''Werther effect''', following Goethe's novel ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]''.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3263660  The Werther effect after television films: new evidence for an old hypothesis], Psychol Med. 1988 Aug;18(3):665-76.</ref>

The well-known suicide serves as a model, in the absence of protective factors, for the next suicide. This is referred to as '''suicide contagion'''.<ref name="AbnormalPsychologyBook">{{cite book |last=Halgin |first=Richard P. |coauthors=Susan Whitbourne |title=Abnormal Psychology with MindMap II CD-ROM and PowerWeb |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |year=2006 |pages=62 |month=January |isbn=0-07-322872-9}}</ref> They occasionally spread through a [[school]] system, through a community, or in terms of a celebrity suicide wave, nationally. This is called a '''suicide cluster'''.<ref name="AbnormalPsychologyBook"/> Suicide clusters are caused by the social learning of suicide related behaviors, or "copycat suicides". Point clusters are clusters of suicides in both time and space, and have been linked to direct social learning from nearby individuals.<ref name="Goleman (1987)">{{cite news|last=Golman|first=D|title=Pattern of Death: Copycat Suicides among Youths.|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/18/nyregion/pattern-of-death-copycat-suicides-among-youths.html|work=1987|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=April 21, 2011|date=1987-03-18}}</ref> Mass clusters are clusters of suicides  in time but not space, and have been linked to the broadcasting of information concerning celebrity suicides via the mass media<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mesoudi|first=A|title=The Cultural Dynamics of Copycat Suicide.|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2009|volume=4|issue=9}}</ref>  Examples of celebrities whose suicides have inspired suicide clusters include [[Ruan Lingyu]], the Japanese musicians [[Yukiko Okada]] and [[Hide (musician)|hide]], and [[Marilyn Monroe]], whose death was followed by an increase of 200 more suicides than average for that August month.<ref name=AbnormalPsychologyBook />

Another famous case is the [[self-immolation]] of [[Mohamed Bouazizi]], a Tunisian street vendor who set himself on fire on December 17, 2010, an act that was a catalyst for the [[Tunisian Revolution]] and sparked the [[Arab Spring]], including several men who [[Mohamed Bouazizi#Copycat incidents|emulated Bouazizi's act]]. 

To prevent this type of suicide, it is customary in some countries for the media to discourage suicide reports except in special cases.

==History==
One of the earliest known associations between the media and suicide arose from [[Goethe]]'s novel ''Die Leiden des jungen Werthers'' (''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]''). Goethe's novel was published in 1774 and not long after young men began to mimic the character Werther by dressing in yellow pants and blue jackets. The new fashion trend seemed to be entertaining to the public. A new trend also emerged from the book causing it to be banned in numerous areas. In the novel, Werther commits suicide with a pistol after he is rejected by the woman he loves. Many men replicated this trend in an act of hopelessness.<ref name="Meyer's Social Psychology">{{cite book|last=Meyers|first=David G.|title=Social Psychology (10th Ed)|year=2009|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-337066-8}}</ref> In that work the hero shoots himself after an ill-fated love, and shortly after its publication there were many reports of young men using the same method to commit suicide. This resulted in a ban of the book in several places. Hence the term "Werther effect", used in the technical literature to designate copycat suicides.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/entity/mental_health/media/en/426.pdf |title=Preventing suicide: A report for media professionals |accessdate=2007-06-09 |year=2000 |format=PDF |publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}</ref> The term was coined by researcher [[David Phillips]]{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2013}} in 1974.<ref>{{cite news |last=De Wyze |first=Jeannette |title=Why Do They Die? |publisher= San Diego Reader |date=2005-02-31 |url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2005/mar/31/why-do-they-die/ |accessdate=2008-02-05}}</ref> Two centuries after Goethe's novel was published, David Phillips confirmed imitative suicides as the "Werther effect." Reports in 1985 and 1989 by Phillips and his colleagues found that suicides and other accidents seem to incline after a well publicized suicide.<ref name="Meyer's Social Psychology" /> Copycat suicide is mostly blamed on the media. "Hearing about a suicide seems to make those who are vulnerable feel they have permission to do it," Dr. Phillips said. He cited studies that showed that people were more likely to engage in dangerous deviant behavior, such as drug taking, if someone else had set the example first.<ref name="Goleman (1987)" />

==Factors in suicide reporting==
The Werther effect not only predicts an increase in suicide, but the majority of the suicides will take place in the same or a similar way as the one publicized. The more similar the person in the publicized suicide is to the people exposed to the information about it, the more likely the age group or demographic is to commit suicide. The increase generally happens only in areas where the suicide story was highly publicized.<ref name="Meyer's Social Psychology" /> Upon learning of someone else's suicide, many people decide that action is appropriate for them as well, especially if the publicized suicide was of someone in a similar situation as them.

Publishing the means of suicides, romanticized and sensationalized reporting, particularly about celebrities, suggestions that there is an epidemic, glorifying the deceased and simplifying the reasons all lead to increases in the suicide rate. People may see  suicide as a glamorous ending <U+2014> with youth getting a lot of attention, lots of sympathy, lots of national concern that they never got in life. The second possible factor is that vulnerable youth may feel like, "If they couldn't cut it, neither can I".<ref name=Mulvihill>{{cite news|last=Mulvihill|first=G|title=Experts Fear Copycat Suicides After Bullying Cases.

Studies based on a real as opposed to fictional story were 4.03 times more likely to uncover a copycat effect and research based on televised stories was 82% less likely to report a copycat effect than research based on newspapers. Other scholars have been less certain about whether copycat suicides truly happen or are selectively hyped. For instance, fears of a suicide wave following the [[death of Kurt Cobain]] never materialized in an actual increase in suicides.<ref>Jobes, D., Berman, A., O'Carroll, P., & Eastgard, S. (1996). The [[Death of Kurt Cobain|Kurt Cobain]] suicide crisis: Perspectives from research, public health and the news media. Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior, 26(3), 260-271.</ref> Furthermore, there is evidence for an indirect Werther effect, i.e. the perception that suicidal media content has an impact on others which, in turn, can concurrently or additionally influence one person's own future thoughts and behaviors.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Scherr |first=S. |last2=Reinemann |first2=C. |year=2011 |title=Belief in a Werther effect.

Many people interviewed after the suicide of a relative or friend have a tendency to simplify the issues; their grief can lead to their minimizing or ignoring significant factors. Studies show a high incidence of [[psychiatric disorder]]s in suicide victims at the time of their death with the total figure ranging from 98%<ref>Bertolote JM, Fleischmann A, De Leo D, Wasserman D. (2004) Psychiatric diagnoses and suicide: revisiting the evidence. ''Crisis.'', 25(4):147-55. {{DOI|10.1027/0227-5910.25.4.147}} PMID 15580849</ref> to 87.3%<ref>Arsenault-Lapierre G, Kim C, Turecki G. (2004) Psychiatric diagnoses in 3275 suicides: a meta-analysis. ''BMC Psychiatry'', Nov 4;4:37. {{DOI|10.1186/1471-244X-4-37}} PMID 15527502</ref> with [[mood disorder]]s and [[substance abuse]] being the two most common. These are often undiagnosed or untreated and treatment can result in reductions in the suicide rate. Reports that minimize the impact of psychiatric disorders contribute to copycat suicides whereas reports that mention this factor and provide help-line contact numbers and advice for where sufferers may gain assistance can reduce suicides.

==Social proof model==
An alternate model to explain copycat suicide, called "[[social proof]]" by Cialdini,<ref name="isbn0-688-12816-5">{{cite book |author=Robert B. Cialdini |title=Influence: the psychology of persuasion |publisher=Morrow |location=New York |year=1993 |page=336 |isbn=0-688-12816-5}}</ref> goes beyond the theories of glorification and simplification of reasons to look at why copycat suicides are so similar, demographically and in actual methods, to the original publicized suicide. In the social proof model, people imitate those who seem similar, despite or even because of societal disapproval. This model is important because it has nearly opposite ramifications for what the media ought to do about the copycat suicide effect than the standard model does.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} To deal with this problem, Alex Mesoudi of Queen Mary University, London, developed a computer model of a community of 1000 people, to examine how copycat suicides occur.
These were divided into 100 groups of 10, in a model designed to represent different levels of social organization, such as schools or hospitals within a town or state.
Mesoudi then circulated the simulation through 100 generations. He found the simulated people acted just as sociologists' theory predicted. They were more likely to commit suicide in clusters, either because they had learned this trait from their friends, or because suicidal people are more likely to be like one another.<ref name=Hamzelou>{{cite news|last=Hamzelou|first=J|title=Copycat suicides fuelled by media reports.|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17889-copycat-suicides-fuelled-by-media-reports.html|accessdate=April 21, 2011|newspaper=Newscientist|year=2009}}</ref>

==Journalism codes==
Various countries have national journalism codes which range from one extreme of, "Suicide and attempted suicide should in general never be given any mention" ([[Norway]]) to a more moderate, "In cases of suicide, publishing or broadcasting information in an exaggerated way that goes beyond normal dimensions of reporting with the purpose of influencing readers or spectators should not occur." The study's author, University of London psychologist Alex Mesoudi, recommends reporters to follow the sort of guidelines the World Health Organization and others endorse for coverage of any suicide: Use extreme restraint in covering these deaths <U+2014> keep the word "suicide" out of the headline, don't romanticize the death, and limit the number of stories.<ref name=Franklin>{{cite news|last=Franklin|first=D|title=Copycat Suicides: What's The Media's Role?|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2009/09/copycat_suicides_whats_the_med.html|accessdate=April 21, 2011|newspaper=NPR|year=2009}}</ref> Photography, pictures, visual images or film depicting such cases should not be made public" ([[Turkey]]).<ref name="MediaWise Covering">{{cite web |url=http://www.mediawise.org.uk/files/uploaded/Covering%20Suicide%20Worldwide.pdf |title=Covering suicide worldwide: media responsibilities |accessdate=2007-06-09 |last=Norris |first=Bill |coauthors=Mike Jempson; Lesley Bygrave |month=September |year=2001 |format=PDF |publisher=[[National Institute on Media and the Family|The MediaWise Trust]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070614001050/http://www.mediawise.org.uk/files/uploaded/Covering+Suicide+Worldwide.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-14}}</ref> Many countries do not have national codes but do have in-house guidelines along similar lines. In the [[United States]] there are no industrywide standards and a survey of inhouse guides of 16 US daily [[newspaper]]s showed that only three mentioned the word ''suicide'' and none gave guidelines about publishing the method of suicide. Craig Branson, online director of the [[American Society of News Editors]] (ASNE), has been quoted as saying, "Industry codes are very generic and totally voluntary. Most ethical decisions are left to individual editors at individual papers. The industry would fight any attempt to create more specific rules or standards, and editors would no doubt ignore them."<ref name="MediaWise Covering"/> Guidelines on the reporting of suicides in Ireland were introduced recently which attempt to remove any positive connotations the act might have (e.g. using the term "completed" rather than "successful" when describing a suicide attempt which resulted in a death).{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's]] journalistic standards and practices manual discourages the reporting of the details of suicide.<ref>{{cite web

==Journalist training ==
Australia is one of the few countries where there is a concerted effort to teach journalism students about this subject. The Mindframe national media initiative<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mediawise.org.uk/display_page.php?id=171 |title=Reporting Suicide: Guidance for journalists |accessdate=2007-06-09 |publisher=[[National Institute on Media and the Family|The MediaWise Trust]], Spanish, French}}</ref> followed an ambivalent response by the [[Australian Press Council]] to an earlier media resource kit issued by Suicide Prevention Australia and the Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention. The UK-based media ethics charity [http://www.mediawise.org.uk/ MediaWise] provides training for journalists on reporting suicide and related issues, and has compiled other useful information on the topic at [http://www.mediawise.org.uk/suicide/]

[[Headline]] is Ireland's media monitoring programme for suicide and mental health issues, set up by Shine and the Health Service Executives National Office for Suicide Prevention as part of 'Reach Out: National Strategy for action on Suicide Prevention.' Headline works with media professionals and students to find ways to collaborate to ensure that suicide, mental health and mental illness are responsibly covered in the media and provides information on reporting on mental health and suicidal behavior, literature and daily analysis of news stories. Headline also serves as a vehicle for the public to become involved in helping to monitor the Irish media on issues relating to mental health and suicide.
