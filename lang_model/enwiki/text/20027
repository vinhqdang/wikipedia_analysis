[[Image:Caged bird2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Cover from the first edition of ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' (1969)]]

'''''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings''''' is the 1969 [[autobiography]] about the early years of African-American writer and poet [[Maya Angelou]]. The first in a seven-volume series, it is a [[Bildungsroman|coming-of-age story]] that illustrates how strength of character and a love of literature can help overcome [[racism]] and [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]. The book begins when three-year-old Maya and her older brother are sent to [[Stamps, Arkansas|Stamps]], [[Arkansas]], to live with their grandmother and ends when Maya becomes a mother at the age of 16. In the course of ''Caged Bird'', Maya transforms from a victim of racism with an [[inferiority complex]] into a self-possessed, dignified young woman capable of responding to prejudice.

Angelou was challenged by her friend, author [[James Baldwin]], and her editor, [[Robert Loomis]], to write an autobiography that was also a piece of literature. Reviewers often categorize ''Caged Bird'' as [[autobiographical fiction]] because Angelou uses thematic development and other techniques common to fiction, but the prevailing critical view characterizes it as an autobiography, a genre she attempts to critique, change, and expand. The book covers topics common to autobiographies written by Black American women in the years following the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|civil rights movement]]: a celebration of Black motherhood; a critique of racism; the importance of family; and the quest for independence, personal dignity, and self-definition.

Angelou uses her autobiography to explore subjects such as [[Cultural identity|identity]], [[rape]], racism, and [[literacy]]. She also writes in new ways about women's lives in a male-dominated society. Maya, the younger version of Angelou and the book's central character, has been called "a symbolic character for every black girl growing up in America".<ref name="tate-150">Tate, p. 150</ref> Angelou's description of being raped as an eight-year-old child overwhelms the book, although it is presented briefly in the text. Rape is used as a [[metaphor]] for the suffering of her race. Another metaphor, that of a bird struggling to escape its cage, is a central image throughout the work, which consists of "a sequence of lessons about resisting racist oppression".<ref name="walker-93">Walker, p. 93</ref> Angelou's treatment of racism provides a thematic unity to the book. Literacy and the power of words helps young Maya cope with her bewildering world; books become her refuge as she works through her trauma.

''Caged Bird'' was nominated for a [[National Book Award]] in 1970 and remained on [[New York Times bestseller list|''The New York Times'' paperback bestseller list]] for two years. It has been used in educational settings from high schools to universities, and the book has been celebrated for creating new literary avenues for the American memoir. However, the book's graphic depiction of childhood rape, racism, and sexuality has caused it to be challenged or banned in some schools and libraries.

==Background==
[[Image:Paul Laurence Dunbar.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The book's title comes from a poem by [[African-American]] poet [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]]. The caged bird, a symbol for the chained [[slave]], is an image Angelou uses throughout all her writings.<ref>Lupton, p. 66.</ref>]]

Before writing ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' at the age of forty, Angelou had a long and varied career, holding jobs such as fry cook, dancer, actress, poet, educator, and brothel madam.<ref name="songbird" /> In the late 1950s, she joined the [[Harlem Writers Guild]], where she met a number of important African-American authors, including her friend and mentor [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]]. After hearing civil rights leader [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] speak for the first time in 1960, she was inspired to join the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|Civil Rights movement]]. She organized several benefits for him, and he named her Northern Coordinator of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]]. She worked for several years in [[Ghana]], West Africa, as a journalist, actress, and educator. She was invited back to the US by [[Malcolm X]] to work for him shortly before his assassination in 1965.<ref name="poetry" /> In 1968, King asked her to organize a march, but he too was [[Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination|assassinated]].<ref>Younge, Gary (25 May 2002).

Although she did not intend to compose a series of autobiographies,<ref name="poetry" /> Angelou later wrote six additional volumes, covering a variety of her young adult experiences.

==Plot summary==
{{see also|List of characters in I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings}}

''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' follows Marguerite's (called "My" or "Maya" by her brother) life from the age of three to seventeen and the struggles she faces <U+2013> particularly with [[racism]] <U+2013> in the [[Southern United States]]. Abandoned by their parents, Maya and her older brother Bailey are sent to live with their paternal grandmother (Momma) and crippled uncle (Uncle Willie) in [[Stamps, Arkansas]]. Maya and Bailey are haunted by their parents' abandonment throughout the book <U+2013> they travel alone and are labeled like baggage.<ref>Bloom, p. 19</ref>
[[Image:Lafayette County Arkansas Incorporated and Unincorporated areas Stamps Highlighted.svg|thumb|right|The community of [[Stamps, Arkansas]], is the setting for most of the book.]]

Many of the problems Maya encounters in her childhood stem from the overt racism of her white neighbors. Although Momma is relatively wealthy because she owns the general store at the heart of Stamps' Black community, the white children of their town hassle Maya's family relentlessly. One of these "powhitetrash" girls, for example, reveals her pubic hair to Momma in a humiliating incident. Early in the book, Momma hides Uncle Willie in a vegetable bin to protect him from [[Ku Klux Klan]] raiders. Maya has to endure the insult of her name being changed to Mary by a racist employer. A white speaker at her eighth grade graduation ceremony disparages the Black audience by suggesting that they have limited job opportunities. A white dentist refuses to treat Maya's rotting tooth, even when Momma reminds him that she had loaned him money during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]. The Black community of Stamps enjoys a moment of racial victory when they listen to the radio broadcast of [[Joe Louis]]'s championship fight, but generally they feel the heavy weight of racist oppression.

A turning point in the book occurs when Maya and Bailey's father unexpectedly appears in Stamps. He takes the two children with him when he departs, but leaves them with their mother in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Eight-year-old Maya is sexually abused and raped by her mother's boyfriend, Mr. Freeman. He is found guilty during the trial, but escapes jail time and is murdered, presumably by Maya's uncles. Maya feels guilty and withdraws from everyone but her brother. Even after returning to Stamps, Maya remains reclusive and nearly mute until she meets Mrs. Bertha Flowers, "the aristocrat of Black Stamps",<ref>Angelou, p. 93</ref> who encourages her through books and communication to regain her voice and soul. This coaxes Maya out of her shell.

Later, Momma decides to send her grandchildren to their mother in [[San Francisco, California]], to protect them from the dangers of racism in Stamps. Maya attends [[George Washington High School (San Francisco)|George Washington High School]] and studies dance and drama on a scholarship at the [[California Labor School]]. Before graduating, she becomes the first Black female [[streetcar]] conductor in San Francisco. While still in high school, Maya visits her father in southern California one summer, and has some experiences pivotal to her development. She drives a car for the first time when she must transport her intoxicated father home from an excursion to Mexico. She experiences homelessness for a short time after a fight with her father's girlfriend.

During Maya's final year of high school, she worries that she might be a [[lesbian]] (which she equates with being a [[hermaphrodite]]), and initiates sexual intercourse with a teenage boy. She becomes pregnant, which on the advice of her brother, she hides from her family until her eighth month of pregnancy in order to graduate from high school. Maya gives birth at the end of the book.

==Style and genre==
[[File:Richard Wright.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Like [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]]'s novel ''[[Native Son]]'', ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' has been classified as a ''[[Bildungsroman]]''.]]

''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' has been called a ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' or coming-of-age story.  Although ''Caged Bird'' is an [[autobiography]], critic Mary Jane Lupton compares it to [[George Eliot|George Eliot's]] novel ''[[The Mill on the Floss]]''. According to Lupton, the two books share the following similarities: a focus on young strong-willed heroines who have solid relationships with their brothers, an examination of the role of literature in life, and an emphasis on the importance of family and community life.<ref>Lupton, p. 30</ref> Like [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright's]] ''[[Native Son]]'', the protagonist in ''Caged Bird'' serves as an example of how a young African American can survive. As critic Susan Gilbert states, Angelou was reporting not one person's story, but the collective's.<ref>Gilbert, Susan (1999). "Paths to Escape". In Joanne M. Braxton. ''Maya Angelou's I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings: A Casebook''. New York: Oxford Press. pp. 104<U+2013>105. ISBN 0-19-511606-2</ref>  Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe agrees, and sees Angelou as representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that speaks for an entire group of people.<ref>Cudjoe, pp. 10<U+2013>11</ref>

Angelou made a deliberate attempt while writing ''Caged Bird'' to challenge the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre.<ref name="poetry" /><ref>Lupton, p. 98</ref> Her use of fiction-writing techniques such as dialogue, characterization, and thematic development often lead reviewers to categorize her books as [[autobiographical fiction]].<ref>Lupton, pp. 29<U+2013>30</ref> Lupton insists that all of Angelou's autobiographies conform to the genre's standard structure: they are written by a single author, they are chronological, and they contain elements of character, technique, and theme.<ref>Lupton, p. 32</ref> In a 1983 interview with African-American literature critic [[Claudia Tate]], Angelou calls her books autobiographies.<ref>Tate, p. 153</ref>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="text-align:left; width:25%; float:right; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">"During the months she spent writing the book, [Angelou] practically withdrew from the world. She'd set the bar high. Her ambition was to write a book that would honor the Black experience and affirm the 'human spirit.' She more than achieved her goal. She wrote a coming-of-age story that has become a modern classic".
<p style="text-align: right;">Marcia Ann Gillespie, 2008<ref name="gillespie-101">Gillespie et al, p. 101</ref></blockquote> 
When speaking of her use of autobiography, Angelou acknowledges that she has followed the [[slave narrative]] tradition of "speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'".<ref name="poetry" />  She uses the [[First-person narrative|first-person narrative voice]] customary with autobiographies, but also includes fiction-like elements, told from the perspective of a child that is "artfully recreated by an adult narrator".<ref>Lupton, p. 52</ref>  She uses two distinct voices, the adult writer and the child who is the focus of the book, whom Angelou calls "the Maya character". Angelou reports that maintaining the distinction between herself and the Maya character is "damned difficult", but "very necessary".<ref name="tate-150"/> Scholar Liliane Arensberg suggests that Angelou "retaliates for the tongue-tied child's helpless pain" by using her adult's [[irony]] and wit.<ref>Arensberg, p. 114</ref>

Angelou recognizes that there are fictional aspects to her books <U+2013> she tends to "diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth".<ref>Lupton, p. 34</ref> Her approach parallels the conventions of many African-American autobiographies written during the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] period in the US, when truth was often censored for purposes of self-protection.<ref>Sartwell, p. 26</ref> Author Lyman B. Hagen places Angelou in the long tradition of African-American autobiography, but insists that she has created a unique interpretation of the autobiographical form.<ref>Hagen, pp. 6<U+2013>7</ref> In a 1998 interview with journalist [[George Plimpton]], Angelou discussed her writing process, and "the sometimes slippery notion of truth in nonfiction" and memoirs.<ref name="journalism">Rogers, Ronald R. (Spring 2006). "Journalism: The Democratic Craft". ''Newspaper Research Journal''.</ref> When asked if she changed the truth to improve her story, she stated, "Sometimes I make a diameter from a composite of three or four people, because the essence in only one person is not sufficiently strong to be written about."<ref name="journalism" /> Although Angelou has never admitted to changing the facts in her stories, she has used these facts to make an impact with the reader. As Hagen states, "One can assume that 'the essence of the data' is present in Angelou's work".<ref name="hagen-18">Hagen, p. 18</ref> Hagen also states that Angelou "fictionalizes, to enhance interest".<ref name="hagen-18" /> Angelou's editor, [[Robert Loomis]], agrees, stating that she could rewrite any of her books by changing the order of her facts to make a different impact on the reader.

Scholar Joanne M. Braxton sees ''Caged Bird'' as a representative example of the autobiographies written by African-American women in the years following the civil rights movement. The book presents themes that are common in autobiography by Black American women: a celebration of Black motherhood; a criticism of racism; the importance of family; and the quest for independence, personal dignity, and self-definition.<ref>Braxton (2004), p. 64</ref> Angelou introduces a unique point of view in American autobiography by revealing her life story through a narrator who is a Black female, at some points a child, and other points a mother.<ref>Lupton, pp. 52<U+2013>53</ref> Writer [[Hilton Als]] calls Angelou one of the "pioneers of self-exposure", willing to focus honestly on the more negative aspects of her personality and choices.<ref name="songbird" /> For example, while Angelou was composing her second autobiography, ''[[Gather Together in My Name]]'', she was concerned about how her readers would react to her disclosure that she had been a prostitute. Her husband Paul Du Feu talked her into publishing the book by encouraging her to "tell the truth as a writer" and to "be honest about it".<ref>Lupton, p. 14</ref>

==Themes==
As critic Pierre A. Walker notes, when Angelou wrote ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' at the end of the 1960s, one of the necessary and accepted features of literature was thematic unity, and one of Angelou's goals was to create a book that satisfied this criterion. The structure of the text, which resembles a series of short stories, is not chronological but rather thematic. Walker believes that Angelou succeeded in emphasizing identity, racism, rape, and literacy, despite the narrative's episodic quality.<ref name="walker-93"/> As Hagen states, she structures the book into three parts: arrival, sojourn, and departure, which occur both geographically and psychologically.<ref>Hagen, p. 58</ref>

===Identity===
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="text-align:left; width:25%; float:right; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">The Black female is assaulted in her tender years by all those common forces of nature at the same time that she is caught in the tripartite crossfire of male prejudice, white illogical hate and Black lack of power.
<p align="right">Maya Angelou, ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings''<ref>Angelou, p. 265</ref></blockquote>

In the course of ''Caged Bird'', Maya, who has been described as "a symbolic character for every black girl growing up in America",<ref name="tate-150"/> goes from being a victim of racism with an inferiority complex to a self-aware individual who responds to racism with dignity and a strong sense of her own identity. [[Feminist literary criticism|Feminist scholar]] Maria Lauret states that the "formation of female cultural identity" is woven into the book's narrative, setting Maya up as "a role model for Black women".<ref name="lauret-97">Lauret, p. 97</ref> African-American literature scholar Dolly McPherson states that Angelou, in her demonstration of the passage from childhood to young adulthood, creatively uses "the Christian myth" and presents the themes of death, regeneration, and rebirth.<ref name="mcpherson-28" />  Scholar Liliane Arensberg calls this presentation Angelou's "identity theme" and a major motif in Angelou's narrative.  Maya's unsettled life in ''Caged Bird'' suggests her sense of self "as perpetually in the process of becoming, of dying and being reborn, in all its ramifications".<ref>Arensberg, p. 115</ref>

As Lauret indicates, Angelou and other female writers in the late 1960s and early 1970s used the autobiography to reimagine ways of writing about women's lives and identities in a male-dominated society. Up until this time, Black women were not depicted realistically in African American fiction and autobiography, so Angelou was one of the first Black autobiographers to present, as Cudjoe put it, "a powerful and authentic signification of [African American] womanhood in her quest for understanding and love rather than for bitterness and despair".<ref>Cudjoe, p. 11</ref> Lauret sees a connection between Angelou's autobiographies, which Lauret calls "fictions of subjectivity" and "feminist first-person narratives", and fictional first-person narratives (such as ''[[The Women's Room]]'' by [[Marilyn French]] and ''[[The Golden Notebook]]'' by [[Doris Lessing]]) written during the same period.  Both genres employ the narrator as [[protagonist]] and "rely upon the illusion of presence in their mode of signification".<ref>Lauret, p. 98</ref>

As a displaced girl, Maya's pain is worsened by an awareness of her displacement.  She is "the forgotten child", and must come to terms with "the unimaginable reality" of being unloved and unwanted;<ref name="mcpherson-28">McPherson, p. 28</ref> she lives in a hostile world that defines beauty in terms of whiteness and that rejects her simply because she is a Black girl. Maya internalizes the rejection she has experienced <U+2013> her belief in her own ugliness was "absolute".<ref>McPherson, p. 25</ref> McPherson believes that the concept of family, or what Lupton called "kinship concerns",<ref>Lupton, p. 11</ref> in Angelou's books must be understood in the light of the children's displacement at the beginning of ''Caged Bird''.<ref>McPherson, p. 14.</ref> Being sent away from their parents was a psychological rejection, and resulted in a quest for love, acceptance, and self-worth for both Maya and Bailey.<ref>Smith, p. 52.</ref>
[[Image:Angeloupoem.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Maya Angelou|Angelou]] (shown here in 1993, reciting her poem, "On the Pulse of Morning", at President [[Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton's]] inauguration) demonstrates an evolution of female identity throughout her autobiographical works.]]

Lauret agrees with other scholars that Angelou uses her many roles, incarnations, and identities throughout her books to illustrate how oppression and personal history are interrelated. For example, in ''Caged Bird'', Angelou demonstrates the "racist habit"<ref name="lauret-97" /> of renaming African Americans, as shown when her white employer insists on calling her "Mary".  Angelou describes the employer's renaming as the "hellish horror of being 'called out of [one's] name'".<ref>Angelou, p. 91</ref>  Scholar Debra Walker King calls it a racist insult and an assault against Maya's race and self-image.<ref>King, p. 189</ref>  According to scholar Sidonie Ann Smith, the renaming emphasizes Maya's feelings of inadequacy and denigrates her identity, individuality, and uniqueness. Maya understands that she is being insulted and rebels by breaking Mrs. Cullinan's favorite dish.<ref>Smith, p. 53</ref>

An incident in the book that solidifies Maya's identity is her trip to Mexico with her father, when she has to drive a car for the first time.  Contrasted with her experience in Stamps, Maya is finally "in control of her fate".<ref name="smith">Smith, p. 54</ref>  This experience is central to Maya's growth, as is the incident that immediately follows it, her short period of homelessness after arguing with her father's girlfriend.  These two incidents give Maya a knowledge of self-determination and confirm her self-worth.<ref name="smith" />

Beginning in ''Caged Bird'', motherhood is a "prevailing theme"<ref name="poetry">[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=180 "Maya Angelou".] ''Poetry Foundation''. Retrieved 16 December 2013</ref> in Angelou's autobiographies.  Scholar Mary Burgher believes that female Black autobiographers like Angelou have debunked the stereotypes of African American mothers as "breeder and matriarch", and have presented them as having "a creative and personally fulfilling role".<ref>Burgher, p. 115</ref> Lupton believes that Angelou's plot construction and character development were influenced by the same mother/child motif found in the work of [[Harlem Renaissance]] poet [[Jessie Fauset]].<ref>Lupton, p. 49</ref> For the first five years of her life, Maya thinks of herself as an orphan and finds comfort in the thought that her mother was dead.  Maya's feelings for and relationship with her own mother, whom she blames for her abandonment, express themselves in ambivalence and "repressed violent aggression".<ref>Arensberg, p. 118</ref> For example, Maya and her brother destroy the first Christmas gifts sent by their mother. These strong feelings are not resolved until the end of the book, when Maya becomes a mother herself, and her mother finally becomes the nurturing presence for which Maya has longed.<ref>Arensberg, p. 126</ref> The two main maternal influences on Maya's life change as well; Vivian becomes a more active participant, while Momma becomes less effective as Maya, by becoming a mother herself, moves from childhood to adulthood.<ref>Hagen, p. 59</ref>

===Racism===
[[Image:Martin-Luther-King-1964-leaning-on-a-lectern.jpg|thumb|upright|For several years before writing ''Caged Bird'', Angelou worked with [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] during the 1960s to combat racism.]]

''Caged Bird'' has been called "perhaps the most aesthetically satisfying autobiography written in the years immediately following the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|Civil Rights]] era".<ref name="braxton-4">Braxton (1999), p. 4</ref> Critic Pierre A. Walker agrees, and places it in the African American literature tradition of political protest.<ref name="walker-93"/> Angelou demonstrates, through her involvement with the Black community of Stamps, as well as her presentation of vivid and realistic racist characters and "the vulgarity of white Southern attitudes toward African Americans",<ref>Lupton, p. 63</ref> her developing understanding of the rules for surviving in a racist society.  Angelou's autobiographies, beginning with ''Caged Bird'', contain a sequence of lessons about resisting oppression.  The sequence she describes leads Angelou, as the protagonist, from "helpless rage and indignation to forms of subtle resistance, and finally to outright and active protest".<ref name="walker-93"/>

Walker insists that Angelou's treatment of racism is what gives her autobiographies their thematic unity and underscores one of their central themes: the injustice of racism and how to fight it. The structure of ''Caged Bird'' helps to illustrate this theme. ''Caged Bird'', like most autobiographies, begins with Angelou's earliest memories, but she relates events non-chronologically.  For example, the description of the "powhitetrash" girls taunting Maya's grandmother appears in chapter five when Maya was about ten years old, two years after her rape, which occurs in chapter twelve. Maya reacts to the "powhitetrash" incident with rage, indignation, humiliation, and helplessness, but Momma teaches her how they can maintain their personal dignity and pride while dealing with racism.  Walker calls Momma's way a "strategy of subtle resistance"<ref>Walker, p. 96</ref> and McPherson calls it "the dignified course of silent endurance".<ref>McPherson, p. 37</ref>

In the course of her book, Angelou demonstrates that Momma's approach to coping with racism serves as a basis for actively protesting and combating racism. Momma is portrayed as a realist whose patience, courage, and silence ensured the survival and success of those who came after her.<ref>Hagen, p. 70</ref> For example, Maya breaks the race barrier to become the first black streetcar operator in San Francisco, and responds assertively to the demeaning treatment by her white employer Mrs. Cullinan.<ref>Walker, p. 101</ref> In addition, Angelou's description of the strong and cohesive black community of Stamps demonstrates how African Americans subvert repressive institutions to withstand racism.<ref>McPherson, p. 38</ref> Arensberg insists that Angelou demonstrates how she, as a Black child, evolves out of her "racial hatred",<ref name="arensberg-116">Arensberg, p. 116</ref> common in the works of many contemporary Black novelists and autobiographers.  At first Maya wishes that she could become white, since growing up Black in white America is dangerous; later she sheds her self-loathing and embraces a strong racial identity.<ref name="arensberg-116" />

===Rape===
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="text-align:left; width:25%; float:right; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">It should be clear, however, that this portrayal of rape is hardly titillating or "pornographic." It raises issues of trust, truth and lie, love, the naturalness of a child's craving for human contact, language and understanding, and the confusion engendered by the power disparities that necessarily exist between children and adults.
<p align="right">Opal Moore<ref>Moore, p. 53</ref></blockquote>

Angelou's description of being raped as an eight-year-old child overwhelms the autobiography, although it is presented briefly in the text.<ref>Lupton, p. 67</ref> Scholar Mary Vermillion compares Angelou's treatment of rape to that of [[Harriet Jacobs]] in her autobiography ''[[Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl]]''. Jacobs and Angelou both use rape as a metaphor for the suffering of African Americans; Jacobs uses the metaphor to critique slaveholding culture, while Angelou uses it to first internalize, then challenge, twentieth-century racist conceptions of the Black female body (namely, that the Black female is physically unattractive).<ref>Vermillion, p. 66</ref> Rape, according to Vermillion, "represents the black girl's difficulties in controlling, understanding, and respecting both her body and her words".<ref>Vermillion, p. 67</ref>

Arensberg notes that Maya's rape is connected to the theme of death in ''Caged Bird'', as Mr. Freeman threatens to kill Maya's brother Bailey if she tells anyone about the rape. After Maya lies during Freeman's trial, stating that the rape was the first time he touched her inappropriately, Freeman is murdered (presumably by one of Maya's uncles) and Maya sees her words as a bringer of death. As a result, she resolves never to speak to anyone other than Bailey. Angelou connects the violation of her body and the devaluation of her words through the depiction of her self-imposed, five-year-long silence.<ref>Vermillion, p. 73</ref> As Angelou later stated, "I thought if I spoke, my mouth would just issue out something that would kill people, randomly, so it was better not to talk".<ref>Healy, Sarah (21 February 2001). [http://www.dailynexus.com/2001-02-21/maya-angelou-speaks-to-2000-at-arlington-theater/ "Maya Angelou Speaks to 2,000 at Arlington Theater".] ''Daily Nexus'' (UC Santa Barbara) '''81''' (82). Retrieved 16 December 2013.</ref>

Maya's rape demonstrates how as a Black woman, she is violated as she moves from childhood to adolescence.<ref name="poetry" />  African American literature scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe calls its depiction "a burden": a demonstration of "the manner in which the Black female is violated in her tender years and&nbsp;... the 'unnecessary insult' of Southern girlhood in her movement to adolescence".<ref name="poetry" /> Vermillion goes further, maintaining that a Black woman who writes about her rape risks reinforcing negative stereotypes about her race and gender.<ref>Vermillion, pp. 60<U+2013>61</ref> When asked decades later how she was able to survive such trauma, Angelou explained it by stating, "I can't remember a time when I wasn't loved by somebody."<ref>Braxton, p. 11</ref> When asked by the same interviewer why she wrote about the experience, she indicated that she wanted to demonstrate the complexities of rape.  She also wanted to prevent it from happening to someone else, so that anyone who had been raped might gain understanding and not blame herself for it.<ref>Braxton, p. 12</ref>

===Literacy===
[[File:Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Angelou has described [[William Shakespeare]] as a strong influence on her life and works, especially his identification with marginalized people, writing "Shakespeare was a black woman".<ref>Sawyer, Robert (2003). [http://books.google.com/?id=F82jtLKL0QwC&printsec=copyright#PPA82,M1 ''Victorian Appropriations of Shakespeare''.] Cranberry, NJ: Associated University Presses. p. 82. ISBN 0-8386-3970-4</ref>]]

As Lupton points out, all of Angelou's autobiographies, especially ''Caged Bird'' and its immediate sequel ''[[Gather Together in My Name]]'', are "very much concerned with what [Angelou] knew and how she learned it".  Lupton compares Angelou's informal education with the education of other Black writers of the twentieth century, who did not earn official degrees and depended upon the "direct instruction of African American cultural forms".<ref>Lupton, p. 16</ref> Angelou's quest for learning and literacy parallels "the central myth of black culture in America":<ref>Hagen, p. 62</ref> that freedom and literacy are connected.  Angelou is influenced by writers introduced to her by Mrs. Flowers during her self-imposed muteness, including [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[William Shakespeare]]. Angelou states, early in ''Caged Bird'', that she, as the Maya character, "met and fell in love with William Shakespeare".<ref>Angelou, p. 13</ref> Critic Mary Vermillion sees a connection between Maya's rape and Shakespeare's "[[The Rape of Lucrece]]", which Maya memorizes and recites when she regains her speech.  Vermillion maintains that Maya finds comfort in the poem's identification with suffering.<ref>Vermillion, p. 69</ref> Maya finds novels and their characters complete and meaningful, so she uses them to make sense of her bewildering world. She is so involved in her fantasy world of books that she even uses them as a way to cope with her rape,<ref name="arensberg-113">Arensberg, p. 113</ref> writing in ''Caged Bird'', "...I was sure that any minute my mother or Bailey or the [[The Green Hornet|Green Hornet]] would bust in the door and save me".<ref>Angelou, p. 78</ref>

According to Walker, the power of words is another theme that appears repeatedly in ''Caged Bird''. For example, Maya chooses to not speak after her rape because she is afraid of the destructive power of words. Mrs. Flowers, by introducing her to classic literature and poetry, teaches her about the positive power of language and empowers Maya to speak again.<ref>Walker, p. 97</ref>  The importance of both the spoken and written word also appears repeatedly in ''Caged Bird'' and in all of Angelou's autobiographies.{{#tag:ref|There are over 100 references to literary characters throughout all of Angelou's autobiographies.<ref name="hagen-63"/>|group=note}} Referring to the importance of literacy and methods of effective writing, Angelou once advised [[Oprah Winfrey]] in an 1993 interview to "do as West Africans do&nbsp;... listen to the deep talk", or the "utterances existing beneath the obvious".<ref>King, p. 215</ref> McPherson says, "If there is one stable element in Angelou's youth it is [a] dependence upon books". The public library is a "quiet refuge" to which Maya retreats when she experiences crisis.<ref name="arensberg-113" /> Hagen describes Angelou as a "natural storyteller",<ref name="hagen-19" /> with an ear for dialogue that reflect someone who is a good listener with a rich oral heritage. Hagen also insists that Angelou's years of muteness provided her with this skill.

Angelou was also powerfully affected by [[slave narratives]], [[spirituals]], poetry, and other autobiographies.<ref>Lupton, [http://books.google.com/books?id=nBsaFf4qzRQC&pg=PA32&sig=ACfU3U0XPBycQl_hVfY3SOgK_Is66pAtPw p. 32.]</ref> Angelou read through the [[Bible]] twice as a young child, and memorized many passages from it.<ref name="hagen-19">Hagen, p. 19</ref> African-American spirituality, as represented by Angelou's grandmother, has influenced all of Angelou's writings, in the activities of the church community she first experiences in Stamps, in the sermonizing, and in scripture.<ref name="hagen-63">Hagen, p. 63</ref> Hagen goes on to say that in addition to being influenced by rich literary form, Angelou has also been influenced by oral traditions. In ''Caged Bird'', Mrs. Flowers encourages her to listen carefully to "Mother Wit",<ref>Angelou, p. 83</ref> which Hagen defines as the collective wisdom of the African-American community as expressed in [[folklore]] and humor.<ref>Hagan, p. 28</ref>{{#tag:ref|Hagen, in his analysis of ''Caged Bird'', goes through the book and lists all the folk stories and jokes Angelou refers to and uses.<ref>Hagen, pp. 30<U+2013>45</ref>|group=note}}

Angelou's humor in ''Caged Bird'' and in all her autobiographies is drawn from Black folklore and is used to demonstrate that in spite of severe racism and oppression, they thrive and are, as Hagen states, "a community of song and laughter and courage".<ref name="hagen-50">Hagen, p. 50</ref> Hagen states that Angelou is able to make an indictment of institutionalized racism as she laughs at her flaws and the flaws of her community and "balances stories of black endurance of oppression against white myths and misperceptions".<ref name="hagen-50" /> Hagan goes on to characterize ''Caged Bird'' as a "blues genre autobiography"<ref>Hagen, p. 60</ref> because it uses elements of blues music. These elements include the act of testimony when speaking of one's life and struggles, ironic understatement, and the use of natural metaphors, rhythms, and intonations. Hagan also sees elements of African American sermonizing in ''Caged Bird''. Angelou's use of African American oral traditions creates a sense of community in her readers, and identifies those who belong to it.<ref>Hagen, p. 61</ref>

==Reception and legacy==

===Critical reception and sales===
''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' is the most highly acclaimed of Angelou's autobiographies. The other volumes in her series of seven autobiographies are judged and compared to ''Caged Bird.''<ref name="poetry" /> It became a bestseller immediately after it was published,<ref name="gillespie-101" /> and Angelou became known, according to the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'', as an author who "writes like a song, and like the truth. The wisdom, rue and humor of her storytelling are borne on a lilting rhythm completely her own."<ref name="poetry" /> Angelou's friend and mentor, [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]], maintained that her book "liberates the reader into life" and called it "a Biblical study of life in the midst of death".<ref name="moore" />  According to Angelou's biographers, "Readers, especially women, and in particular Black women, took the book to heart".<ref name="gillespie-101" />

By the end of 1969, critics had placed Angelou in the tradition of other Black autobiographers. Poet [[James Bertolino]] asserts that ''Caged Bird'' "is one of the essential books produced by our culture". He insists that "[w]e should all read it, especially our children".<ref>Bertolino, p. 199</ref> It was nominated for a [[National Book Award]] in 1970. The book has never been out of print and has been published in many languages.<ref name="gillespie-101" /> In 1995, Angelou's publishing company, [[Bantam Books]], recognized her for having the longest-running record (two years) on [[New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' paperback nonfiction bestseller list]].<ref>[http://mayaangelou.com/bio/ "Biography".] ''Maya Angelou.com.''

Critic Robert A. Gross called ''Caged Bird'' "a ''tour de force'' of language".<ref name="mcpherson-23">McPherson, p. 23</ref>  Edmund Fuller insisted that Angelou's intellectual range and artistry were apparent in how she told her story.<ref name="mcpherson-23" /> ''Caged Bird'' catapulted Angelou to international fame and critical acclaim, and "heralded the success of other now prominent [black women] writers".<ref>Baisn<U+00E9>e, p. 56</ref> Other reviewers have praised Angelou's use of language in the book, including critic E.

Gross praised Angelou for her use of rich and dazzling images.<ref name="hagen-56" />

By the mid-1980s, ''Caged Bird'' had gone through twenty hardback printings and thirty-two paperback printings.<ref name="hagen-56">Hagen, p. 56</ref> Angelou recited her poem "[[On the Pulse of Morning]]" at President [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1993 inauguration; in the following week, sales of the paperback version of ''Caged Bird'' and her other works rose by 300<U+2013>600 percent.

In one of the few negative reviews of ''Caged Bird'', author [[Francine Prose]] considers its inclusion in the high school curriculum as partly responsible for the "dumbing down" of American society. Prose calls the book "manipulative melodrama", and considers Angelou's writing style an inferior example of poetic prose in memoir. She accuses Angelou of combining a dozen metaphors in one paragraph and for "obscuring ideas that could be expressed so much more simply and felicitously".<ref>Prose, Francine (September 1999).

===Influence===
When ''Caged Bird'' was published in 1969, Angelou was hailed as a new kind of memoirist, one of the first African-American women who was able to publicly discuss her personal life. Up to that point, Black women writers were marginalized to the point that they were unable to present themselves as central characters. Writer Julian Mayfield, who called ''Caged Bird'' "a work of art that eludes description",<ref name="songbird" /> has insisted that Angelou's autobiographies set a precedent not only for other Black women writers, but for African American autobiography as a whole. Als insisted that ''Caged Bird'' marked one of the first times that a Black autobiographer could, as Als put it, "write about blackness from the inside, without apology or defense".<ref name="songbird" />  Through the writing of her autobiography, Angelou became recognized as a respected spokesperson for blacks and women.<ref name="poetry" /> ''Caged Bird'' made her "without a doubt,&nbsp;... America's most visible black woman autobiographer".<ref name="braxton-4" /> Although Als considers ''Caged Bird'' an important contribution to the increase of Black [[feminist]] writings in the 1970s, he attributes its success less to its originality than to "its resonance in the prevailing [[Zeitgeist]]",<ref name="songbird" /> of its time, at the end of the American Civil Rights movement. Angelou's writings, more interested in self-revelation than in politics or feminism, freed many other women writers to "open themselves up without shame to the eyes of the world".<ref name="songbird" />

Angelou's autobiographies, especially the first volume, have been used in narrative and multicultural approaches to [[teacher education]]. Dr. Jocelyn A. Glazier, a professor at [[George Washington University]], has used ''Caged Bird'' and ''[[Gather Together in My Name]]'' to train teachers how to "talk about racism" in their classrooms. Due to Angelou's use of understatement, self-mockery, humor, and irony, readers of Angelou's autobiographies wonder what she "left out" and are unsure about how to respond to the events Angelou describes. These techniques force white readers to explore their feelings about race and their privileged status in society. Glazier found that although critics have focused on where Angelou fits within the genre of African American autobiography and her literary techniques, readers react to her storytelling with "surprise, particularly when [they] enter the text with certain expectations about the genre of autobiography".<ref>Glazier, Jocelyn A. (Winter 2003).

Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book, ''Stories of Resilience in Childhood'', analyzed the events in ''Caged Bird'' to illustrate resiliency in children. Challener states that Angelou's book provides a useful framework for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children succeed as Angelou did.<ref>Challener, Daniel D. (1997). ''Stories of Resilience in Childhood.'' London, England: Taylor & Francis. pp. 22<U+2013>23. ISBN 0-8153-2800-1</ref>  Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has used ''Caged Bird'' to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of [[child development]] topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He has called the book a highly effective tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.<ref> Boyatzis, Chris J. (February 1992).
