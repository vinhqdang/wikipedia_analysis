The '''Ballard Carnegie Library''', also known as the ''Seattle Public Library-Ballard Branch'', is a historic library in the [[Ballard, Seattle, Washington|Ballard]] neighborhood in [[Seattle, Washington]]. The library was predated by a freeholders' library in the [[1860s]], which eventually gave way to a reading room that was organized and funded by a womens' group in [[1901]]. With a grant for $15,000, among other funds, a new library for the then independent City of Ballard was created as a [[Carnegie library]]. The building, located at 2026 N.W. Market Street in downtown Ballard, opened to the public on [[June 24]], [[1904]].<ref name=HistoryLink_3855>HistoryLink.org, [http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=3855 "Carnegie Free Library in Ballard opens on June 24, 1904."].

After its sale, the old library building housed a variety of private commercial enterprises, including an antique shop, a restaurant and a [[kilt]] manufacturer.<ref name=HistoryLink_3855/><ref name=SeattlePI_030501/>

After being nominated in [[1976]] for the recognition by Seattle [[architect]] Larry E. Johnson, it was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP) in 1979 (ID #79002535).<ref name=PreservationSeattle_Carnegie1>Larry E.

==History==
In the late 1860s, when Ballard was a new settlement along the edge of [[Salmon Bay]], a [[homesteader]] named Ira Wilcox Utter helped create a freeholders' library.<ref name=HistoryLink_3878/> Later, in 1901, the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] of Ballard began raising money with fairs and socials for a new reading room on Ballard Avenue; it moved and expanded several times to different locations.<ref name=HistoryLink_3878/><ref name=SEAGove_carnegie1>Seattle.gov Department of Neighborhoods, [http://web1.seattle.gov/DPD/historicalsite/QueryResult.aspx?ID=362 "Summary for 2026 NW Market ST NW / Parcel ID 276700960 / Inv # BA003"]. Retrieved [[October 9]], 2007.</ref> Having decided to build a proper library, the Ballard City Council established a library board in [[1903]]  and the city applied to the [[philanthropist]] [[Andrew Carnegie]] for a library grant to help underwrite the costs of construction of a new library.<ref name=HistoryLink_3878/> The library was built on a lot of {{convert|100|sqft|sqm|1|lk=on}}, which was purchased for $2,100 raised by local businesses and citizens, supported by the earlier fundraising and book collections of the women's union, and a $15,000 grant from Carnegie.<ref name=HistoryLink_3878>HistoryLink.org, [http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=3878 "Ballard Branch, The Seattle Public Library."]. Retrieved [[October 10]], 2007.</ref><ref name=HistoryLink_3855/> When construction was completed, the building included features such as a 500-seat auditorium and a men's [[smoking room]], which was later converted into a reading room. Part of the construction work was executed by a [[chain gang]].<ref name=HistoryLink_3855/>

Initially, the library had a cache of books waiting for the completion and grand opening that was provided by local residents and schools, as Carnegie's gift for the construction did not cover the initial costs of new books.<ref name=HistoryLink_3878 /> A call was also put out for citizens to donate books to the new facility to expand the collection. In 1907, the [[Seattle Public Library]] took control of the Carnegie library, when Ballard was annexed by the neighboring City of Seattle government. Early [[Scandinavian people|Scandinavian]] immigrants to Ballard and the [[Pacific Northwest]] in particular made use of the new facility; Ballard as an area has a strong historical presence of Scandanavian people.<ref name=SEAGove_carnegie1>Seattle.gov Department of Neighborhoods, [http://web1.seattle.gov/DPD/historicalsite/QueryResult.aspx?ID=362 "Summary for 2026 NW Market ST NW / Parcel ID 276700960 / Inv # BA003"].

Retrieved [[October 10]], 2007.</ref> With the arrival of [[World War I]], the Carnegie Library became home to various community activities, such as dispensing information on the war, and also provided [[Red Cross]] and [[English language|English]] language classes.
<ref name=HistoryLink_3878 /> In 1942, during [[World War II]], one of the first [[African American]] librarians in Seattle, Lucille Smith, was assigned to the Carnegie library.<ref name=HistoryLink_3878 />

In 1956, Seattle voters approved a [[Municipal bonds|municipal bond]] to replace what was by then considered the "inadequate and impractical" library.<ref name=SeattlePI_123102>Kathy Mulady, Seattle P.I., [http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/102184_library31xx.shtml "West Seattle Library closing -- but just until fall"], [[December 31]], 2002. Retrieved [[October 10]], 2007.</ref> The Ballard Carnegie Library eventually was shut in 1963, when a new, larger public library was built in the area, and the Carnegie building became an antique store.<ref name=HistoryLink_3855/> One of the cited reasons for the closure and sale of the library building were expert claims that the building would never survive an earthquake (of which Seattle had numerous instances, both before and after 1963). The building has, in fact, survived several quakes since 1963.<ref name=SeattlePI_030501 />
