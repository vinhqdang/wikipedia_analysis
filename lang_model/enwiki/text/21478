'''Homeopathy''' (also hom<U+0153>opathy or homoeopathy; from the [[Greek]], ''<U+1F45><U+03BC><U+03BF><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03C2>, h<U+00F3>moios'', "similar" + ''<U+03C0><U+03AC><U+03B8><U+03BF><U+03C2>, p<U+00E1>thos'', "suffering" or "disease") is a controversial form of [[alternative medicine]] that aims to treat "like with like". Substances that cause symptoms similar to the disease in large quantities are heavily diluted, with shaking at each stage of the dilution. Homeopaths contend that the shaking causes some imprint (or [[water memory|memory]]) of the diluted substance, despite the fact that at many common homeopathic dilutions, no molecules of the original substance are likely to remain.<ref name=homsim>{{cite news  | title= Similia similibus curentur (Like cures like) | publisher= Creighton University Department of Pharmacology | url =http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/philosophy/similia.htm |  accessdate = 2007-08-20 }}</ref> Homeopathy is based on a [[vitalist]] world view, which sees the underlying causes of sickness as imbalances in a hypothetical [[vital force]]. Proponents claim that homeopathic treatment can harmonize and re-balance the vital force in the body, so restoring health. This claim is unsupported by modern [[biology]] or [[medicine]].<ref name=pmid14651731/><ref name=pmid14973954/><ref name=pmid12535487/><ref name=pmid11212088/><ref name="pmid16125589"/>

Homeopathy traces its origins to the late 18th century when it was founded by [[Germany|German]] [[physician]] [[Samuel Hahnemann]], who noted some similarity of the symptoms of undiluted cinchona bark in healthy individuals with those of [[malaria]], which it is used to treat. Hahnemann decided that an effective drug must produce the symptoms in healthy individuals that are similar to the symptoms of the sick patient which they are supposed to be treating.<ref name="homhist1"/> Based on later experiments, Hahnemann reasoned that using natural doses of substances would generally not help patients because, if they produced effects similar to those of the disease, they would only make symptoms worse, and thus proposed the [[dilution]] of substances in water or [[alcohol]], with shaking (known as "succussion") after each dilution, in order to try and imprint the liquid with the memory of the original substance. To account for homeopathic remedies sometimes failing to produce lasting cures of long-standing chronic diseases, Hahnemann proposed that the vital force in the body has the ability to react or adapt to disturbances, referred to as the "law of susceptibility", and that various causes can attract hypothetical disease-causing entities called "miasms", which he claimed could produce symptoms of disease within the body, and formed a deeper, harder to treat cause of illness.<ref name="homhist1"/>  

The medical efficacy of homeopathic treatments is unconfirmed by [[scientific method|scientific]] and [[clinical]] studies.<ref name="nhspseudo"/><ref name="amapseudo"/><ref name="pmid11416076" />  The hypothesis that extreme dilution makes any [[pharmaceutical|drug]] more powerful is antithetical to the principles of [[chemistry]] and [[physics]] as well as the observed [[dose-response relationship]]s of conventional medicines. The [[scientific community]] asserts there is no scientific evidence supporting the contention that water or alcohol retain any memory of a substance. Researchers conclude that any positive effects of homeopathic treatment are simply a [[placebo effect]].<ref name=pmid16125589/> Homeopaths are also often accused of giving 'false hope' to patients who might be better advised to seek effective conventional treatments. Studies have shown homeopaths frequently advise patients to avoid standard medical procedures including drugs which can prevent diseases such as malaria.<ref name=pmid9243229/><ref name=pmid8554846/> The meta-analyses that have been done on homeopathy have confirmed that its effects are unlikely to be beyond that of placebo, and those studies that have shown positive results for homeopathic treatments were flawed in design. These findings, along with the proscription by homeopaths against conventional medicine and their encouragement of a "holistic" approach to health, are in keeping with the conclusion of many scientists that homeopathy is a sort of [[quackery]].<ref name=pmid11316508/><ref name=pmid8255290/><ref name=pmid1376282/>

==History==
Modern homeopathy was created by [[Germany|German]] [[physician]] [[Samuel Hahnemann]] during the late 18th and early 19th century. The system of similars emphasized in homeopathy was first described by doctors of the ''[[vitalist]]'' school of medicine and one of the most prominent proponents of vitalism was the [[Renaissance]] physician [[Paracelsus]]. Paracelsus subscribed to many of the same principles as the modern founder of homeopathy, Samuel Hahnemann. [[Vienna]] physician [[:de:Anton von St<U+00F6>rck|Anton Freiherr von St<U+00F6>rck]] and [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[physician]] [[John Brown (doctor)|John Brown]] also held similar medical beliefs to Samuel Hahnemann prior to the conception of homeopathy

===18th century medicine===

In Hahnemann's day, mainstream medicine was a degenerate form of [[Galenic|Galenism]], with a theory of disease based upon the ancient [[Greek]] idea of four [[humours]]. Medicine of the time professed to restore the balance of the humours, mostly by employing such measures as [[bloodletting]] and purging, use of [[laxative]]s, [[enema]]s and substances that induced vomiting, as well as suppressing symptoms using complex mixtures of plant and mineral drugs in strong doses. Such measures often made symptoms worse or proved fatal. By contrast, Hahnemann rebelled against these methods, and the use of mixed drugs in strong doses, favoring the use of single drugs in milder doses. He later came to promote an immaterial, [[vitalism|vitalistic]] view of how living organisms function and thought that diseases have [[Spirituality|spiritual]], as well as physical causes.<ref>{{cite book

However, in the twentieth century, medicine discarded vitalism in favor of the [[germ theory]] of disease, following the work of [[Robert Koch]], [[Louis Pasteur]], [[Alexander Fleming]], [[Joseph Lister]] and many others.

===Concepts===
[[Image:Samuel Hahnemann.png|thumb|right|'''Samuel Hahnemann''', considered to be the father of homeopathy]]
Samuel Hahnemann conceived of homeopathy while translating a [[Materia Medica]], a treatise by [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[physician]] and [[chemist]] [[William Cullen]], into [[German language|German]]. On reading about [[cinchona]] bark, from which [[quinine]] is extracted and is used to treat malaria, he noticed that Cullen described the mechanism of the substance as having "stomach strengthening properties". Hahnemann was skeptical of this explanation and decided to understand the effects of Cinchona bark by taking it himself. Upon ingesting the bark, he noticed that he experienced [[fever]], [[shivering]] and [[arthralgia]] (joint pain). These symptoms are similar to some of those of [[malaria]], which the substance was supposed to be treating, and from this he decided that all effective drugs must produce the symptoms in healthy individuals that are similar to the diseases which they are supposed to be treating. This later became known as the "Law of similars", and the most important concept of homeopathy.<ref name=homhist1>{{cite news | title=History of Homeopathy | publisher= Creighton University Department of Pharmacology | url =http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/history.htm  | accessdate = 2007-07-23 }}</ref> The term "homeopathy" was coined by Hahnemann and first appeared in print in 1807,<ref name= Hahnemannprint>Hahnemann, S.

This article can be read in English translation on the [http://www.minutus.org/index.asp Minutus] website, where it appears as [http://www.minutus.org/library/article_read.asp?id=6 ''Essay On A New Principle For Ascertaining The Curative Powers Of Drugs - Birth of Homeopat''], [[Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann]], 1796.</ref>

Hahnemann began to test which symptoms were produced by which substances, which would later become known as "proving". The tests were time-consuming and required subjects to clearly record all of their symptoms as well as when they appeared. Hahnemann used them to decide which substances would be used to treat which disease. The first collection of provings was published in 1805 and a second collection of 65 remedies appeared in the ''Materia Medica Pura'' in 1810. As Hahnemann believed that large doses of things that caused similar symptoms would only aggravate illness, he advocated extreme dilutions of the substances, and came up with a technique for these dilutions that he believed would preserve the substance's essence while removing its harmful effects. He gathered and published a complete overview of his new medical system in his 1810 book, ''[[The Organon of the Healing Art]]'', whose 6th edition, published in 1921, is still used by homeopaths today.<ref name="homhist1"/>

During the 19th century homeopathy grew in popularity: In 1830 the first homeopathic schools opened, and throughout the 19th century dozens of homeopathic institutions appeared in Europe and the United States.<ref name=Julian> {{cite web|url=http://www.wholehealthnow.com/homeopathy_pro/homeopathy_1825_1849.html |title=Homeopathy Timeline |accessdate=2007-07-23 |last=Winston |first=Julian |date=2006 |work="The Faces of Homoeopathy" |publisher=Whole Health Now }}</ref> Homeopathic hospitals also appeared and practitioners of homeopathy often had better outcomes compared to those of their counterparts in mainstream medicine, due to the then-common practices of [[blood-letting]] and use of untested medicines that were often poisonous. Homeopathic treatments, even if ineffective, would almost surely cause no harm, making the users of homeopathic medicine less likely to be killed by the medicine which was supposed to be helping them.<ref name="homhist1"/>

The last school in the U.S. exclusively teaching homeopathy closed down in 1920, though the Hahnemann School of Medicine, now part of [[Drexel University]], continued to offer homeopathy electives until the 1940s.<ref name="homhist1"/> A few homeopathic courses are still taught in a few colleges, but usually alongside other alternative medical treatments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncnm.edu/academics/naturopathic_school.php |title=The Naturopathic School |accessdate=2007-09-13 |publisher=NCNM }}</ref>

==General philosophy==

Homeopathy is a [[vitalism|vitalist]] philosophy in that it regards diseases and sickness to be caused by disturbances in a hypothetical [[vital force]] or [[life force]] in humans and that these disturbances manifest themselves as unique symptoms. Homeopathy contends that the vital force has the ability to react and adapt to internal and external causes, which homeopaths refer to as the "law of susceptibility". The law of susceptibility states that a negative state of mind can attract hypothetical disease entities called "miasms" to invade the body and produce symptoms of diseases,<ref name="homhist1"/> However, Hahnemann rejected the notion of a disease as a separate thing or invading entity<ref> {{cite web|url=http://julianwinston.com/archives/articles/winston_organon_outline.php |title=OUTLINE OF THE ORGANON |accessdate=2007-08-04 |last=Winston |first=Julian }}</ref> and insisted that it was always part of the "living whole".<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.homeopathyhome.com/reference/organon/organon.html |title=Organon Of Medicine |accessdate=2007-08-04 |last=Hahnemann |first=Samuel }}</ref>

===Miasms and disease===

Miasms were proposed by Hahnemann to explain the failure of homeopathic remedies to produce lasting cures for chronic diseases, in 1828,<ref>The Chronic Diseases, their Nature and Homoeopathic Treatment, [[Dresden]] and [[Leipsic]], Arnold. Vols. 1, 2, 3, 1828; vol. 4, 1830</ref> with hints of the idea found as early as 1816. Hahnemann associated various miasms with specific diseases that have historically plagued mankind, with each miasm causing several diseases. According to Hahnemann, miasmatic infection caused local symptoms, usually in the skin, and if these are suppressed by external medication, the cause goes deeper, and manifests itself later as disease of the internal organs.<ref name="ntlworld"/> Homeopathy contends that treating symptoms by directly opposing their actions, as is done in conventional medicine, is not effective in treating diseases because the miasms still remain, and that the only way to correct the ailments is to correct the disturbance of the vital force.<ref name=homphilo>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Cause of Disease in homeopathy | date= | publisher= Creighton University Department of Pharmacology | url =http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/philosophy/cause.htm | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-23 | language = }}</ref> 

This controversial claim remains common even in modern times. In 1978, [[Anthony Campbell]], then a consultant physician at The Royal London Homeopathic Hospital,<ref name=ac>[http://www.acampbell.ukfsn.org/homeopathy/homeopathy-html/chapter01.html Homeopathy in Perspective], Anthony Campbell. Accessed [[2007-03-24]]</ref><ref>[http://www.acampbell.ukfsn.org/personal.html Personal file], Anthony Campbell. Accessed [[2007-03-24]]</ref> criticized statements by George Vithoulkas claiming that [[syphilis]], when treated with antibiotics, would develop into secondary and tertiary syphilis with involvement of the central nervous system. This conflicts with scientific studies, which indicate that penicillin treatment produces a compete cure of syphilis in more than 90% of cases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Birnbaum NR, Goldschmidt RH, Buffett WO |title=Resolving the common clinical dilemmas of syphilis |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/990415ap/2233.html |journal=American family physician |volume=59 |issue=8 |pages=2233-40, 2245-6 |year=1999 |pmid=10221308}}</ref> Campbell described this as "a thoroughly irresponsible statement which could mislead an unfortunate layman into refusing orthodox treatment" and said that it was not an isolated case, but part of a lengthy section arguing against conventional medicine.<ref>[http://www.minimum.com/reviews/science-homeopathy.htm Critical review of ''The Science of Homeopathy'']  from the ''British Homoeopathic Journal'' Volume 67, Number 4, October 1978</ref> This echoes the idea in homeopathy that using medication to suppress the symptoms of a disease would only drive the underlying disease deeper into the body.

Originally Hahnemann presented only three miasms, of which the most important was  "psora" ([[Greek]] for ''itch''), described as being related to any itching diseases of the skin, supposed to be derived from suppressed scabies, and claimed to be the foundation of many further disease conditions. Hahnemann claimed psora to be the cause of such diseases as [[epilepsy]], [[cancer]], [[jaundice]], [[deafness]], and [[cataracts]].<ref name="Ramey"/> Since Hahnemann's time, other miasms have been proposed, some replacing one or more of psora's proposed functions, including [[Tuberculosis|tubercular]] miasms and [[cancer]] miasms.<ref name=ntlworld> {{cite web|url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/homeopathy_advice/Theory/Intermediate/miasm.html |title=Miasms in homeopathy |accessdate=2007-07-24 }}</ref>

===Law of similars===

Hahnemann experimented with Cinchona bark, which is used as a treatment of malaria, and observed that the side effects he experienced from the quinine in the Cinchona bark were similar to the symptoms of malaria. He reasoned that treatments for diseases must produce symptoms similar to of those disease being treated when taken by healthy individuals. From this Hahnemann conceived of the "law of similars", otherwise known as "like cures like" ({{lang-la|similia similibus curentur}}). Hahnemann believed that by inducing artificial symptoms of a disease, the artificial symptoms would create another disturbance in the vital force thus pushing out the old disturbance and that the body would naturally recover from the artificially induced disturbance. The basic idea is that to cure a person suffering from an illness, one should administer a dilute dose of a substance that produces the same symptoms of the illness being treated in healthy individuals.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/homeopathy_advice/Theory/Intermediate/miasm.html |title=Miasms in homeopathy |accessdate=2007-07-24 }}</ref>

==Development of remedies==
===Dilution and succussion===
[[Image:Mortar2.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Mortar and pestle used for grinding insoluble solids into homeopathic remedies including quartz and oyster shells.]]
In producing treatments for diseases, homeopaths use a process called "dynamization" or "potentization" where the remedy is diluted into alcohol or water and then vigorously shaken by ten hard strikes against an elastic body in a process called "succussion". Hahnemann thought that the use of remedies which present symptoms similar to those of disease in healthy individuals would only intensify the symptoms and exacerbate the condition, so he advocated the dilution of the remedies to the point the symptoms were no longer experienced. During the process of potentization, homeopaths believe that the vital energy of the diluted substance is activated and its energy released by vigorous shaking of the substance. For this purpose, Hahnemann had a saddle maker construct a special wooden striking board covered in leather on one side and stuffed with horsehair.<ref>[http://www.igm-bosch.de/english/f10.htm The Institute for the History of Medicine] official website</ref> Insoluble solids, such as [[quartz]] and [[oyster]] shell, are diluted by grinding them with [[lactose]] (''[[trituration]]'').

Three potency scales are in regular use in homeopathy. Hahnemann pioneered and always favored the centesimal or "C scale", diluting a substance 1 part in a 100 of diluent. Some homeopaths developed a decimal scale (D or X) diluting the substance 1 part in 10 of diluent. Hahnemann never used this scale but it was very popular throughout the 19th century and still is in Europe. This potency scale appears to have been introduced in the 1830s by the American homeopath, Dr. Constantine Hering.<ref>{{cite book

Hahnemann advocated 30C dilutions for most purposes, i.e. dilution by a factor of 100<sup>30</sup>, and a common homeopathic treatment for the flu is a 200c dilution of duck liver, called ''Oscillococcinum'' in homeopathy. As [[Avogadro's number]] is only 6.022 <U+00D7> 10<sup>23</sup> particles per [[Mole (unit)|mole]], the chance of any molecule of the original substance being present in a 15x solution is very small, and the chances of a single molecule of the original substance remaining in a 24x(12c) dilution would be roughly 1 in 2 billion. For a perspective on these numbers, there are in the order of 10<sup>32</sup> molecules of water in an [[Olympic size swimming pool]] and if such a pool were filled with a homeopathic substance, to expect to get a single molecule from the original substance in a 15C solution, one would need to swallow 1% of the volume of such a pool, or roughly 25 metric tons of water.<ref name=dynam> {{cite web|url=http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/philosophy/dilution.htm|title=Dynamization and Dilution |accessdate=2007-07-24 }}</ref>

For more perspective, 1ml of a solution which has gone through a 30C dilution would have been diluted into a volume of water equal to that of a cube of 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 meters per side, or about 105 light years. Thus, homeopathic remedies of the standard dilutions contain, with overwhelming probability, only water. Practitioners of homeopathy believe that this water retains some 'essential property' of the original substance, due to the shaking after each dilution.<ref>G. Resch and V. Gutmann, ''Scientific Foundations of Homoeopathy''</ref> Hahnemann believed that the dynamization or shaking of the solution caused a "spirit like" healing force to be released from within the substance. He thought that even after every molecule of the previous substance has been removed from the water, the spiritual healing force still remained.<ref name="dynam"/>

It should be noted however that not all homeopaths advocated extremely high potencies. Many of the early homeopaths were originally doctors and generally tended to use lower potencies such as "3x" or "6x", rarely going beyond "12x". A good example of this approach is that of Dr. Richard Hughes, who dismissed the extremely high potencies as unnecessary. This was the dominant pattern in [[Europe]] throughout the 1820s to 1930s, but in America many practitioners developed and preferred the higher dilutions. This trend became especially exemplified by James Tyler Kent and dominated US homeopathy from the 1850s until its demise in the 1940s. The split between lower and higher dilutions also followed ideological lines with the former stressing pathology and a strong link to conventional medicine, while the latter emphasized vital force, miasms and a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] take on sickness.<ref>{{cite book

===Provings===
In order to determine which specific remedies could be used to treat which diseases, Hahnemann experimented on himself for several years as well as with patients. His experiments did not initially consist of giving remedies to the sick, because he thought that the most similar remedy, by virtue of its ability to induce symptoms similar to the disease itself, would make it impossible to determine which symptoms came from the remedy and which from the disease itself. Therefore, sick people were excluded from the provings. The method used for determining which remedies were suitable for specific diseases was called "proving". A homeopathic proving is the method by which the [[Profile (engineering)|profile]] of a [[homeopathic remedy]] is determined. The word 'proving' derives from the [[Germany|German]] word 'Pr<U+00FC>fung' meaning 'test'. 

During the process of proving, Hahnemann used healthy volunteers who were given remedies, often in molecular doses, and the resulting symptoms were compiled by observers into a "Drug Picture". During the process the volunteers were observed for months at a time and were made to keep extensive journals detailing all of their symptoms at specific times during the day. During the tests volunteers were forbidden from consuming coffee, tea, spices, or wine. They were also not allowed to play chess, because Hahnemann considered it to be "too exciting", however they were allowed to drink beer and were encouraged to moderately exercise. After the experiments were over, Hahnemann made the volunteers offer their hands and take an oath swearing that what they reported in their journals was the truth, at which time he would interrogate them extensively concerning their symptoms.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.acampbell.ukfsn.org/homeopathy/homeopathy-html/chapter02.html |title=HOMEOPATHY IN PERSPECTIVE |accessdate=2007-07-24 |last=Campbell |first=Anthony }}</ref>

The first recorded 'proven' drugs were published by Hahnemann in his 1796 ''Essay on a New Principle'' and later in his ''[[Materia Medica Pura]]'' which contained 27 and 65 proven drugs respectively. In his Lectures on ''Homoeopathic Materia Medica'' published in 1905, [[James Tyler Kent]] listed 217 remedies, and newer substances are continually added to contemporary versions.

===Repertory===
[[Image:Rep1.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Homeopathic repertory by James Tyler Kent.]]
A compilation of reports of many homeopathic provings is known as a [[homeopathic materia medica]]. In practice the usefulness of such a compilation is limited because a practitioner does not need to look up the symptoms for a particular remedy, but rather to explore the remedies for a particular symptom. This need is filled by the ''[[homeopathic repertory]]'', which is an index of symptoms, listing after each symptom those remedies that are associated with it. Repertories are often very extensive and may include data from clinical experience in addition to provings. There is often lively debate among the compilers of a repertory and interested practitioners over the veracity of a particular inclusion. The first symptomatic index of the homeopathic materia medica was arranged by Hahnemann. Soon after, one of his students [[Clemens Maria Franz von B<U+00F6>nninghausen|Clemens von B<U+00F6>nninghausen]], created the ''Therapautic Pocket Book'', another homeopathic repertory. The first such Homeopathic Repertory was Dr. George Jahr's Repertory, published in 1835 in [[German language|German]] and then again in 1838 in English and edited by Dr. Constantine Hering. This version was less focused on disease categories and would be the forerunner to Kent's later works. It consisted of three large volumes. Such Repertories increased in size and detail as time progressed.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.crystalinks.com/homeopathy.html |title=HOMEOPATHY |accessdate=2007-08-20 }}</ref>

==Treatments==
[[Image:Homoeopathic Medicine.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Homeopathic remedy arsenicum album derived from [[arsenic]].]]

Homeopathic treatments of patients generally begin with detailed examinations of the patient's history including questions regarding one's physical, mental and emotional state, one's life circumstances and presenting physical/emotional illness. Homeopaths then translate a patient's entire health status into a complex formula of mental and physical symptoms, including likes, dislikes, innate predispositions and even body type.<ref name="Ramey"/> The goal is to develop a comprehensive representation of the individual's overall health. This information can then be compared with similar established data in the drug provings found in the homeopathic materia medica. Assisted by further dialogs with the patient, the homeopath then aims to find the one drug most closely matching the 'symptom totality' of the patient. There are many methods for determining the most-similar remedy (the ''simillimum''), and homeopaths sometimes disagree. This is partly due to the complexity of the "''totality of symptoms''" concept. That is, homeopaths do not use all symptoms, but decide which are the most characteristic. This subjective evaluation of case analysis relies on knowledge and experience of the homeopath doing the diagnosis.<ref name="Ramey"/>

Some diversity in approaches to treatments exists among homeopaths. So called "Classical" homeopathy generally involves detailed examinations of a patient's history and infrequent doses of a single remedy as the patient is monitored for improvements in symptoms. On the other hand, "clinical" homeopathy uses a range of approaches including [[Cocktail remedies|combinations of remedies]] to "cover" the various symptoms of an illness, similar to conventional drug treatments.<ref name=pmid12614092/> A good example is ABC, a combination of Aconite, Belladonna and Chamomilla, often used for relief of childhood fevers.<ref>http://www.1-800homeopathy.com/enews/march05.php</ref>

===Remedies===
[[Image:1belladonna.jpg|thumb|200px|Old Homeopathic [[Deadly nightshade|belladona]] remedy.]]
"Remedy" is a technical term used in homeopathy to refer to a substance prepared with a particular procedure and intended for treating patients. Homeopathic practitioners rely on two types of reference when prescribing remedies. The Homeopathic Materia Medicae which is comprised of alphabetical indexes of "drug pictures" organized by remedy and describe the symptom patterns associated with individual remedies. They also rely on homeopathic repertories which consist of indexes of symptoms of diseases and listing remedies associated with specific symptoms.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.elixirs.com/medica.htm |title=Materia Medica: Remedy Information |accessdate=2007-07-24 |last=Jones |first=Kathryn }}</ref>

Homeopathy uses many animal, plant, mineral, and synthetic substances in its remedies. Examples include ''Natrum muriaticum'' ([[sodium chloride]] or table salt), ''[[Lachesis muta]]'' (the venom of the [[bushmaster (snake)|bushmaster]] [[snake]]), ''[[Opium]]'', and ''Thyroidinum'' ([[thyroid hormone]]). Homeopaths also use treatments called ''nosodes'' (from the [[Greek]] ''nosos'', disease) made from diseased or pathological products such as fecal, urinary, and respiratory discharges, blood, and tissue.<ref name="pmid16322800">{{cite journal

Some modern homeopaths have also considered more esoteric substances, known as "imponderables" because they do not originate from a material but from [[electromagnetic energy]] presumed to have been "captured" by alcohol or lactose. Examples include [[X-ray]]s, [[sunlight]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hominf.org/posi/posiintr.htm |title=The Hom<U+0153>opathic Proving of Positronium |accessdate=2007-07-24 |last=Norland |first=Misha |date=1998 }}</ref> and [[electricity]].<ref> {{cite web|url=http://homeoint.org/clarke/e/elect.htm |title=MATERIA MEDICA |accessdate=2007-07-24 |last=CLARKE |first=John Henry }}</ref> Recent ventures by homeopaths into even more esoteric substances include [[thunderstorms]] (prepared from collected rainwater)<ref> {{cite web|url=http://uk.geocities.com/veryscarymary/stormremedy1.html |title=The Homeopathic proving of 'Tempesta' the Storm |accessdate=2007-07-24 |last=English |first=Mary }}</ref> and even samples of the [[Berlin wall]].<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.biolumanetics.net/tantalus/Cases/BerlinWall.htm |title=THE BERLIN WALL: A REMEDY OF POWER |accessdate=2007-07-24 |last=Wansbrough |first=Charles }}</ref> Today there are about 3,000 different remedies commonly used in homeopathy.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=63203 |title=Homeopathy: Natural Approach or All a Fake? |accessdate=2007-07-24 |last=Doheny |first=Kathleen }}</ref>

===Isopathy===
Isopathy is a therapy derived from homeopathy and was invented by Johann Joseph Wilhelm Lux in the [[1830s]].<ref> {{cite web|url=http://alternative-medicine.healthspace.eu/isopathy.php |title=Isopathy |accessdate=2007-07-25 }}</ref> Isopathy differs from homeopathy in general in that the remedies are made up either from things that cause the [[disease]], or from products of the disease, such as [[pus]]. Many so-called "homeopathic vaccines" are in fact a form of isopathy.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.homeoinfo.com/08_non-classical_topics/is_it_homeopathy/isopathy.php |title=Isopathy |accessdate=2007-07-25 }}</ref>

===Tautopathy===
Tautopathy is a practice of [[alternative medicine]] that is similar to [[homeopathy]] in that it uses very diluted substances to treat illness. However, tautopathy does not rely on the law of similars, as homeopathy does. According to practitioners of Tautopathy, dilute solutions of lead and arsenic can cause the body to secrete excess amounts of these toxic metals.<ref>[http://www.hpathy.com/tautopathy/tautopathy.asp ''Tautopathy - An Introduction''], Manish Bhatia, Tautopathy, [http://www.hpathy.com/ Homeopathy for Everyone: Everything Homeopathic!]</ref>

===Veterinary homeopathy===
Veterinary homeopathy is the term used to describe the treatment of animals with [[homeopathy]]. Hahnemann himself however did none of his work on animals and classical homeopathic principles would seem to conflict with the idea of homeopathic treatments for non humans as syphilis and gonorrhea are not conditions that are recognized in animals.<ref name="Ramey"/>  In the [[USA]] veterinary homeopathy is used by [[veterinarian]] members of the Academy for Veterinary Homeopathy and/or the American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.hompath.net/allopathy/clinical-trials.php |title=Clinical trials |accessdate=2007-07-24 }}</ref> In the [[UK]], [[veterinary surgeon]]s who use homeopathy belong to the [[Faculty of Homeopathy]] and/or to the [[British Association of Homeopathic Veterinary Surgeons]] or [[BAHVS]]. Animals may only be treated by qualified veterinary surgeons in the UK and some other countries. Internationally, the body that supports and represents homeopathic veterinarians is the [[International Association for Veterinary Homeopathy]] or [[IAVH]]. There have been no rigorous scientific demonstrations of therapeutic effects of homeopathy in veterinary medicine and a German review of homeopathy in veterinary medicine has stated that the medical effectiveness of homeopathy in higher dilutions is not verified and that giving an animal a placebo can play an active role in influencing the owner to believe in the effectiveness of the treatment when none exists.<ref name="Ramey"/>

==Medical and scientific analysis==
Homeopathy has been criticized by those in the scientific community since its inception. The extreme dilutions used in homeopathic preparations, which would often leave none of the active ingredient (no [[atoms]], [[ions]] or [[molecules]]), is inconsistent with the well observed [[dose-response relationship]]s of conventional drugs. The idea that the water contains the 'memory' or 'vibration' from the diluted ingredient is also counter to the accepted laws of [[chemistry]] and [[physics]]. Thus critics contend that any positive results obtained from homeopathic remedies are purely due to the [[placebo]] effect, where the patients subjective improvement of symptoms is based solely on the power of suggestion, due to the individual expecting or believing that it will work. Critics cite the lack of viable scientific studies for the effectiveness of homeopathic remedies as evidence that they are not effective and that any positive effects are due to the placebo effect. Critics also contend that homeopathy is inherently dangerous, because homeopaths offer a false hope to patients who could be getting proper treatment by a conventional medical doctor.

===High dilutions===
The extremely high dilutions in homeopathy have been a main point of criticism. Homeopathy often dilutes remedies to the point there are no molecules from the original substance left in the final remedy, leading many critics to conclude that any effect that might have been present from the original substance is no longer in existence. Homeopathy contends that the higher the dilution (lower dose) actually equates to stronger effects of the medicine. This is inconsistent with modern sciences observations of [[dose-response relationship]]s that has been demonstrated by pharmacologists.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/homeo.html |title=Homeopathy: The Ultimate Fake |accessdate=2007-07-25 |last=Barrett |first=Stephen |date=2004-12-28 |work=National Institutes of Health |publisher=[[NCCAM]] }}</ref> According to the dose response relationship in modern medicine, smaller doses of chemicals produce smaller effects and larger doses produce larger effects generally. This has been confirmed in thousands of experiments on organisms as diverse as nematodes,<ref>Boyd WA, Williams PL. "Comparison of the sensitivity of three nematode species to copper and their utility in aquatic and soil toxicity tests."  ''Environ Toxicol Chem.'' 2003 Nov;22(11):2768-74</ref> rats<ref>Goldoni M, Vettori MV, Alinovi R, Caglieri A, Ceccatelli S, Mutti A.

''J Biomed Sci.'' 2006 June 29;</ref> Critiques of the high dilutions in homeopathy date back to the early 19th century.

Homeopaths believe that after vigorous shaking, water retains a memory of a substance that once existed in it, even if the substance is no longer present. Critics respond that water will have been in contact with millions of different substances in its history. According to this molecular paradigm, any glass of water must be regarded as an extreme dilution of almost any agent you care to mention. Thus, critics argue that by drinking water one receives homeopathic treatment for every imaginable condition.<ref>{{cite web | title=Horizon's Homeopathic Coup, Cuzco's Altitude, More Funny Sites, The Clangers, Overdue, Orbito Nabbed in Padua, Randi A Zombie?, Stellar Guests at Amazing Meeting, and Great New Shermer Books! | work=Swift, Online Newsletter of the JREF, November 29, 2002, James Randi Educational Foundation | url=http://www.randi.org/jr/112902.html | accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref><ref name="Ramey"/> Critics assert that proponents of homeopathy are unable to accept the molecular paradigm as a complete account of life phenomena and therapeutics. They believe that the methodical dilution of a particular substance, beginning with a 10% or lower solution and working downwards, with shaking after each dilution, produces a therapeutically active 'remedy', in contrast to regular water which is therapeutically inert. However, chemically, a dilution of anything at 30C is identical to water.

===Clinical trials===
Homeopathy is considered to have paved the way for modern medical practices including experiments to determine the value of medical remedies, systematic and quantitative procedures, and the use of statistics. Early scientists including Joseph Lister and Sidney Ringer stated that they were led by homeopathy to important pharmacological discoveries.<ref name=Ramey> {{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Medicine/Homeop.html |title=HOMEOPATHY AND SCIENCE: A CLOSER LOOK |accessdate=2007-07-25 |last=Ramey |first=David W. |coauthors=Mahlon Wagner, Robert H. Imrie, Victor Stenger. |publisher=The Technology Journal of the Franklin Institute }}</ref> However, despite the fact that some of the procedures in homeopathy were ahead of their time, the medical effectiveness of homeopathy has been a point of contention since its inception. Early trials testing the efficacy of homeopathic treatments conducted by Hahnemann himself lacked the scientific rigor of modern scientific studies, and the first modern studies investigating the effectiveness of homeopathy date back to 1906.<ref> {{cite journal|title=The test drug-proving of the O O and L Society.

More recent and controlled clinical trials done on homeopathy have shown poor results, with some showing no difference between homeopathic remedies and placebo and others showing only a slight difference.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://nccam.nih.gov/health/homeopathy/#q8entury/1940s/brit_homeo_soc/brit_homeo_soc_commentary.html |title=Questions and Answers About Homeopathy |accessdate=2007-07-25 |work=National Institutes of Health |publisher=[[NCCAM]] }}</ref> Systematic reviews and [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] which analyze large groups of studies and draw conclusions based on the results as a whole have been used to determine the effectiveness of homeopathy.

The medical effectiveness of homeopathy has been studied in detail since at least the 1980s, however all large studies showing homeopathy to be effective for medical purposes have been methodologically flawed, and earlier studies showing positive results have been questioned.<ref name="pmid1825800"/> There have also been numerous landmark studies which have brought into question the validity of homeopathic treatments. In 2005 [[The Lancet]] medical journal published a meta-analysis of 110 placebo-controlled homeopathy trials and 110 matched conventional-medicine trials based upon the [[Swiss Federal Council|Swiss government]]'s [[Program for Evaluating Complementary Medicine]], or PEK. The study concluded that its findings were compatible with the notion that the clinical effects of homeopathy are nothing more than placebo effects.<ref name=pmid16125589>{{cite journal

Since homeopathic remedies at dilutions higher than about D23 (10<sup>-23</sup>) contain no ingredients apart from the diluent (water, alcohol or sugar), there is no chemical basis for them to have any medicinal action.

Critics also contend that it is inherently unethical to provide homeopathic remedies to patients or to owners of animals when the effectiveness of homeopathy is clearly unproven. Critics also assert that all homeopathic patients or clients should be fully informed of the lack of experimental basis for the effectiveness of homeopathy prior to being provided the remedies. Critics say that it would be obviously unethical to employ unsupported and unproven remedies such as homeopathy when alternative remedies in modern medicine have been proven to be effective.<ref name="Ramey"/>

==Prevalence and legal trends==
Homeopathic medicine is fairly common in some countries while uncommon in others and is also highly regulated in some countries while fairly unregulated in others. Homeopathy is common in Europe as a whole, where about 25% to 50% of the population have reported use of homeopathic treatments,<Ref>Course description: [http://www.nymc.edu/cpm/homeopathy.pdf Introduction to Medical Homeopathy], [[New York Medical College]]</ref>. In [[Britain]] homeopathy was first established by Dr. Frederick Quin around 1827, although two Italian homeopathic doctors (Drs Romani and Roberta) had been employed two years previously by the Earl of Shrewsbury based at [[Alton Towers]] in [[Stoke-on-Trent|North Staffordshire]]. Homeopathy in Britain quickly became the preferred medical treatment of the upper classes,<ref>Leary, B, Lorentzon M & Bosanquet, A, 1998, It Wont Do Any Harm: Practice & People At The London Homeopathic Hospital, 1889<U+2013>1923, in Juette, Risse & Woodward, 1998 Juette, R, G Risse & J Woodward [Eds.], 1998, Culture, Knowledge And Healing: Historical Perspectives On Homeopathy In Europe And North America, Sheffield Univ.

The largest organization of homeopaths in [[Britain]], the Society of Homeopaths, was founded in 1978 and the [[Faculty of Homeopathy]], which is based in London, has over 1,400 members and was incorporated by an [[Act of Parliament]] in 1950.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.trusthomeopathy.org/faculty/fac_over.html |title=The Royal Archives are based in the Round Tower at Windsor Castle |accessdate=2007-07-24 |publisher=British Homeopathic Association }}</ref> According to a 2006 study, forty nine percent of [[Scottish]] medical practices prescribed homeopathic remedies, with sixteen percent of children were prescribed homeopathic remedies.

Regulations vary in Europe depending on the country. In some countries, there are no specific legal regulations concerning the use of homeopathy, while in others, licenses or degrees in conventional medicine from accredited universities are required. In [[Austria]] and [[Germany]], no specific regulations exist, while [[France]] and [[Denmark]] mandate licenses to diagnose any illness or dispense of any product whose purpose is to treat any illness.<ref name=WHO> {{cite web|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2001/WHO_EDM_TRM_2001.2.pdf |title=Legal Status of Traditional Medicine and Complementary/Alternative Medicine: A Worldwide Review |accessdate=2007-09-12 |date=2001 |format=PDF |work=World Health Organization |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] }}</ref> Some homeopathic treatment is covered by the national insurance coverage of several European countries, including [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], Denmark, and [[Luxembourg]].

In [[Austria]], public insurance requires scientific proof of effectiveness in order to reimburse medical treatments, but exceptions are made for homeopathy.<ref name="WHO"/> Two countries which formerly offered homeopathy under their public health insurance schemes have withdrawn this privilege. At the start of 2004, homeopathic medications, with some exceptions, were no longer covered by German public health insurance,<ref>[http://www.dhu.de/wc_800/archiv/GMG.shtml Gesundheitssystem: Was bringt das neue Gesetz?] (in German)</ref> and in June 2005, the [[Swiss]] Government, after a 5-year trial, withdrew insurance coverage for homeopathy and four other complementary treatments, claiming that they did not meet efficacy and cost-effectiveness criteria, though additional insurance can be bought to cover such treatments provided by a medical doctor.<ref>[http://www.kaufmann-net.ch/ Bundesratsentscheid <U+00FC>ber die Leistungen f<U+00FC>r Alternativmedizin: Information about Homeopathy in [[Switzerland]] by Vera Kaufmann, BHSc.Hom.] (in German)</ref>

In the United States, homeopathic remedies are, like all health-care products, regulated by the [[Food and Drug Administration]]. However, the FDA treats homeopathic remedies very differently than conventional medicines. Homeopathic products do not need FDA approval before sale; they do have to be proven safe since the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, any products prior to 1994 may or may not have been tested for safety, but they do not have to prove efficacy; they do not have to be labeled with an expiration date; and they do not have to undergo finished product testing to verify contents and strength, all of these are voluntary actions done by the manufacturer. The manufacturer is required to have all ingredients on the label; however, it might not specify which ones are active. In the USA, only homeopathic medicines that claim to treat self-limiting conditions may be sold over the counter; homeopathic medicines that claim to treat a serious disease can be sold only by prescription.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/ora/compliance_ref/cpg/cpgdrg/cpg400-400.html Sec. 400.400 Conditions Under Which Homeopathic Drugs May be Marketed (CPG 7132.15)] Downloaded 26 April 2007.</ref> A memorandum, written in 1985 by attorneys for the American Association of Homeopathic Manufacturers, describes a meeting between the AAHP attorneys and high-ranking FDA officials to discuss whether homeopathic products must be proven effective to remain legally marketable.<ref name"1985_memorandum">[http://www.homeowatch.org/reg/meeting.html Meeting between FDA Officials and Homeopathic Pharmacists (1985)]. Memorandum, February 12, 1985</ref> Such negotiations led to the issuance in 1988 (revised in 1995) of an ''FDA Compliance Policy Guide'' that permits homeopathic products "intended solely for self-limiting disease conditions amenable to self-diagnosis (of symptoms) and treatment" to be marketed as nonprescription drugs.<ref name="compliance_guide">[http://www.fda.gov/ora/compliance_ref/cpg/cpgdrg/cpg400-400.html Compliance Policy Guide (CPG 7132.15).

This report indicated that nearly all examined compounds derived from the use of mercury. However, due to the extreme dilution of materials, the presence of mercury in the finished product would be minimal.<ref name="mercury">[http://www.fda.gov/cder/fdama/mercuryreport.htm Report on Mercury Compounds in Drugs]MERCURY COMPOUNDS IN DRUGS AND FOOD FDA/Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Last Updated: August 09, 2001</ref> At present the FDA Health Fraud Division only pursues claims which may cause direct harm to consumers through their use. Homeopathic drugs, largely regarded as equivalent to placebos, are not considered under these guidelines. Due to the significant dilution of the products, the agents become practically immeasurable: the harmful effects of homeopathic drugs is more likely to be that patients avoid conventional treatments.<ref name="IHF">[http://www.fda.gov/cder/Offices/DNDLC/hfimain.htm Internet Health and Fraud Site, US Food and Drug Administration]US FDA Internet Site, 2007</ref>

In Asia, the use of homeopathic treatments is increasing, especially in India. Homeopathy arrived in [[India]] with Dr John Martin Honigberger in [[Lahore]], in 1829<U+2013>1830.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.hpathy.com/Status/homeopathy-India.asp |title=Homeopathy in India |accessdate=2007-07-24 |last=Bhatia |first=Manish }}</ref><ref>Jugal Kishore, About Entry of Homeopathy Into India, Bull.
