==Medicine==
After graduating from Duke, Meriwether took his internship at the [[Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center]], before starting a residency at [[The Ohio State University College of Medicine|Ohio State University Medical Center]].<ref name="si1"/> He later specialized in [[hematology]], the study of blood, and had a number of papers published.<ref name="pubmed1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=Search&Term=%22Meriwether%20WD%22%5BAuthor%5D&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVAbstract|title=Meriwether WD - Author|publisher=[[PubMed]]|accessdate=March 12, 2009}}</ref><ref name="ebony1">{{cite journal|date=February 1972|title=The World's Fastest M.D.|journal=Ebony|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|volume=27|issue=4|pages=59<U+2013>64|issn=0012-901|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref> In the early 1970s he worked researching [[Leukemia]] at the [[University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center|Baltimore Cancer Research Center]],<ref name="courant1"/> and was a 1973-1974 [[White House Fellows|White House Fellow]].<ref name="people1"/>

In 1976 Meriwether, as Special Assistant to the Assistant Secretary of Health, was appointed Director of the [[United States Public Health Service]]'s National Influenza Immunization Program (NIIP). The NIIP sought to immunize over 200 million people against [[swine influenza]] within six months. This program faced much opposition as many doctors, pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies refused to take responsibility for mishaps. Meriwether became the public face of this campaign.<ref name="people1">{{cite news |last=Burstein |first=Patricia |title=A Champion Runner, Dr. Meriwether Finds the Swine Flu Program He Heads More Like An Obstacle Race |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20067063,00.html |date=November 1, 1976 |publisher=[[People magazine]] |accessdate=March 6, 2009}}</ref><ref name="avianflu1">{{cite book|last=Orr|first=Tamra|title=Avian Flu|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|year=2007|pages=26|isbn=1-4042-0950-6}}</ref><ref name="neustadt1">{{cite book |last=Neustadt |first=Richard E.  |coauthors=Fineberg, Harvey V. |title=The Epidemic that Never was: Policy-making and the Swine Flu Scare |publisher=Vintage Books |year=1983 |pages=159, 172 |isbn=0-394-71147-5 |accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref><ref name="house1">{{cite book|title=Hearings, Reports and Prints of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce |publisher=[[United States Congress]] |year=1976 |accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref>

==Athletics==
Meriwether began competitive running in 1970 while working at the Baltimore Cancer Research Center. In order to train Meriwether would scale a fence at the nearby [[Johns Hopkins University]] athletics track and would run at night in the dark.<ref name="courant1">{{cite news|url=http://www.courant.com/sports/bal-te.faces27,0,912962,full.story|title=Faces in the Crowd|last=Klingaman|first=Mike|date=November 26, 2005|publisher=[[Hartford Courant]]|accessdate=March 9, 2009}}</ref>  Due to his relative inexperience and unique attire, Meriwether drew the attention of the news media; appearing on the cover of [[Sports Illustrated]] magazine posing in his running gear,<ref name="si1"/> and also featured in [[Time magazine]].<ref name="time1"/> 

Meriwether made his mark as a runner at the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] [[USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships]] in [[Eugene, Oregon]] in June 1971 when he won the [[100 yard dash]].<ref name="si1">{{cite news|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1084609/index.htm|title=Champion Of The Armchair Athletes|last=Boyle|first=Robert H.|date=February 22, 1971|publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=March 6, 2009}}</ref> His appearance at the event was unusual for a number of reasons. He was unattached to any educational institution and he was wearing a [[Scrubs (clothing)|hospital shirt]], gold and white [[suspenders]] and [[Swimsuit|swimming trunks]]. The most remarkable element of the day was the time he recorded for the [[100 yard dash]]. In recording a nine second 100 yard he became the second runner to run the distance in nine seconds flat, the other being [[John Carlos]], however Meriwether's time did not count as a record as the run was [[100 metres#Climatic conditions|wind assisted]].<ref name="si3">{{cite news|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1084486/index.htm|title=hey, I Can Beat Those Guys|last=Treadwell|first=Sandy|date=January 18, 1971|publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=March 8, 2009}}</ref><ref name="time1"/><ref name="dailynews1"/><ref name="aden1">{{cite book|last=Aden|first=Roger|title=Popular Stories and Promised Lands |publisher=University of Alabama Press|year=1999|pages=204|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref>

In 1972 Meriwether was the [[USA Indoor Track and Field Championships|United States Indoor Track and Field Champion]],<ref name="usatf1">{{cite web|url=http://www.usatf.org/statistics/champions/USAIndoorTF/men/m60m.asp|title=USA Indoor Track & Field Champions|publisher=[[USA Track & Field]]|accessdate=March 6, 2009}}</ref> but due to a knee injury he was unable to compete for selection for the United States [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympic Games]] team. After another injury prevented his chances of being selected for the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]], he retired from regular competition to concentrate on medicine.<ref name="si2">{{cite news|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1009660/index.htm|title=Sprinter Delano Meriwether|last=Noden|first=Merrill|date=March 24, 1997|publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=March 6, 2009}}</ref>

For a number of years he ran in [[Masters athletics|masters]] events and his 200 meter run of 20.8 seconds in 1978 is still a current [[United States Records in Masters Athletics|national record]] in the 35-39 age group.<ref name="USATF2">{{cite web|url=http://www.usatf.org/statistics/records/view.asp?division=american&location=outdoor%20track%20%26%20field&age=masters&ageGroup=35-39&sport=TF|title=American Masters 35-39 Outdoor Track & Field Records|publisher=USA Track & Field|accessdate=March 6, 2009}}</ref>
