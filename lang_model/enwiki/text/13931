'''Ann Lois Romney''' (n<U+00E9>e '''Davies'''; born April 16, 1949) is the wife of American businessman and politician [[Mitt Romney]], who was the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee in the [[2012 United States Presidential Election|2012 U.S. presidential election]]. From 2003 to 2007 she was [[First Lady]] of [[Massachusetts]] while her husband served as governor of the state.

She was raised in [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan]], and attended the private [[Cranbrook Kingswood School|Kingswood School]] there, where she dated Mitt Romney. She converted to [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in 1966. She attended [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU), married Mitt Romney in 1969, and in 1975 received a Bachelor of Arts degree in French.

As First Lady of Massachusetts, she served as the governor's liaison for federal faith-based initiatives.  She was involved in a number of children's charities, including [[Operation Kids]], and was an active participant in [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2008|her husband's 2008 presidential run]] as well as the 2012 one.

Romney was diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]] in 1998 and has credited a mixture of mainstream and alternative treatments with giving her a lifestyle mostly without limitations. In one of those activities, [[equestrianism]], she has consequently received recognition in [[dressage]] as an adult amateur at the national level and competed professionally in [[Grand Prix Dressage|Grand Prix]] as well. In 2008, she was also diagnosed with [[ductal carcinoma in situ]], a non-invasive type of [[breast cancer]]. She underwent a [[lumpectomy]] in December of the same year and has since been cancer-free.

She and husband Mitt have five sons, born between 1970 and 1981, and twenty-two grandchildren.
