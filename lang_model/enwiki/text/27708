'''Wesley Kanne Clark, Sr.''', (born December 23, 1944) is a retired [[General (United States)|general]] of the [[United States Army]]. Graduating as [[valedictorian]] of his class at [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], he was awarded a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to the [[University of Oxford]] where he obtained a degree in [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]], and later graduated from the [[Command and General Staff College]] with a master's degree in [[military science]]. He spent 34 years in the Army and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], receiving many [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|military decorations]], several honorary [[knight]]hoods, and a [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].

Clark commanded [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Operation Allied Force]] in the [[Kosovo War]] during his term as the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|Supreme Allied Commander Europe]] of [[NATO]] from 1997 to 2000.

Clark joined the 2004 race for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2004|presidential nomination]] as a candidate on September 17, 2003, but withdrew from the primary race on February 11, 2004, after winning the [[Oklahoma]] state primary, endorsing and campaigning for the eventual Democratic nominee, [[John Kerry]].

==Early life and education==
Clark's paternal great-grandfather was a [[History of the Jews in Belarus|Belarusian Jew]] who [[Immigration to the United States|immigrated to the United States]] in response to the [[Pale of Settlement]] and [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] violence from [[Russian Empire|Russia]]n [[pogrom]]s. Clark's grandfather, Benjamin J. Kanne, graduated from the [[Chicago-Kent College of Law]] and served in the [[United States Navy Reserve|U.S. Naval Reserve]] as an [[Ensign (rank)#United States|ensign]] during [[World War I]], although he was never assigned to a combat mission. Kanne, living in Chicago, became involved with [[Wards of the United States|ward politics]] in the 1920s as a prosecutor and served in local offices. He went on to serve as a delegate to the [[1932 Democratic National Convention]] that nominated [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] as the party's [[President of the United States|presidential candidate]]<ref>Felix, Antonia, ''Wesley Clark: A Biography''. Newmarket Press; New York, New York, 2004. pp. 7<U+2013>9.</ref> (though his name does not appear on the published roll of convention delegates).<ref>Official Report of the Proceedings of the Democratic National Convention, held at Chicago, Illinois, June 27 to July 2, inclusive, 1932</ref>

Kanne came from the [[Kohen]] family line,<ref>Felix, pp. 12<U+2013>13.</ref> and Clark's son has characterized his parents' marriage, between [[Judaism|Jewish]] Benjamin and [[Methodism|Methodist]] Veneta Kanne,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clark04.com/about/ |title=Clark 2004 biography |publisher=Clark04.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-15}}{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref> as "about as multicultural as you could've gotten in 1944."<ref name="AmerSon">''[http://a471.g.akamai.net/7/471/9997/v0001/clark.download.akamai.com/9997/preview/AmericanSon_hi.wmv American Son]'' by Linda Bloodworth. Produced by Linda Burstyn, Cathee Weiss and Douglas Jackson; edited by Gregg Featherman.</ref>

Clark was born Wesley Kanne in Chicago on December 23, 1944. His father Benjamin died on December 6, 1948, following which his mother then moved the family to [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], [[Arkansas]]. This move was made for a variety of reasons, including escaping the greater cost of living in a large city such as Chicago, the support Veneta's family in Arkansas could provide, and her feeling of being an outsider to the remaining Kanne family as she did not share their religion.<ref>Felix, pp. 14<U+2013>15.</ref> Once in Little Rock, Veneta married Viktor Clark, whom she met while working as a secretary for a local bank.<ref>Felix, p. 22.</ref> Viktor raised Wesley as his son, and officially [[adoption|adopted]] him on Wesley's 16th birthday. Wesley's name was changed to Wesley Kanne Clark. Viktor Clark's name actually replaced that of Wesley's biological father on his [[birth certificate]], something Wesley would later say that he wished they had not done.<ref>Felix, p. 25.</ref> Veneta raised Wesley without telling him of his Jewish ancestry to protect him from the anti-Semitic activities of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] occurring in the South at the time.<ref>Felix pp. 16<U+2013>17.</ref> Although his mother was Methodist, Clark chose a [[Baptist]] church after moving to Little Rock and continued attending it throughout his childhood.<ref>Felix, p. 21.</ref>

He graduated from [[Hall High School (Arkansas)|Hall High School]] with a [[National Merit Scholarship Program|National Merit Scholarship]], and helped take their [[swimming (sport)|swim]] team to the state championship, filling in for a sick teammate by swimming two legs of a [[relay race|relay]].<ref name="AmerSon"/><ref>Felix, p. 41.</ref><ref>Felix, p. 52.</ref> Clark has often repeated the [[anecdote]] that he decided he wanted to go to [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] after meeting a [[Officer Cadet#United States|cadet]] with glasses who told Clark (who wore glasses as well) that one did not need [[visual acuity|perfect vision]] to attend West Point as Clark had thought.<ref name="AmerSon"/><ref>Felix, p. 49.</ref> Clark applied, and was accepted on April 24, 1962.<ref>Lambert, J. C., MajGen. "Letter of Acceptance to West Point Military Academy." Letter to Wesley J. Clark. 24 April 1962.</ref>

==Military career==
[[File:West Point Acceptance Letter.gif|200x|thumb|Clark's acceptance letter from [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]]]
Clark's military career began July 2, 1962, when he entered the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York|West Point]], [[New York]]. Clark later said an important influence on his view of the military came from [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s famous "[[wikisource:Duty, honor, country|Duty, honor, country]]" speech given to the class of 1962, only months before Clark entered West Point. A recording of the speech was played for Clark's class when they first arrived.<ref name="AmerSon"/><ref name="westpoint">Felix, pp. 54<U+2013>68.</ref>

Clark sat in the front in many of his classes, a position held by the highest performer in class. Clark participated heavily in [[debate]], was consistently within the top 5% of his class as a whole (earning him a "Distinguished Cadet" patch on his uniform), and ultimately graduated as [[valedictorian]] of West Point. The valedictorian is first to choose which career field of the Army to serve in, and Clark selected [[armoured forces|armor]]. He met Gertrude Kingston, his future wife, at a [[United Service Organizations|USO]] dance for [[Midshipman#United States Navy and Marine Corps|midshipmen]] and West Point cadets.<ref name="AmerSon"/><ref name="westpoint"/>

Clark eventually applied for a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] and learned in December of his senior year at West Point that he had been accepted. He spent his summer at the [[United States Army Airborne School]] at [[Fort Benning]], Georgia. Clark worked in the [[Philosophy, Politics, and Economics]] (PPE) program during his Rhodes Scholarship, completing his degree at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]] at the [[University of Oxford]] in August 1968. While he was at Oxford, a Jewish cousin of Clark's who lived in England telephoned Clark and informed him of his Jewish heritage (after asking his mother if she would allow it). Clark spent three months after graduation at [[Fort Knox]], Kentucky, going through Armor Officer Basic Course, then went on to [[Ranger School]] at Fort Benning. He was promoted to [[Captain (U.S. Army)|captain]] and was assigned as commander of the A [[company (military unit)|Company]] of the 4th Battalion, 68th Armor, [[82nd Airborne Division (United States)|82nd Airborne Division]] at [[Fort Riley]], [[Kansas]].<ref>Felix, pp. 69<U+2013>80.</ref>

===Vietnam===
[[File:Silver Star Citation.gif|200x|thumb|Clark's [[Silver Star]] citation]]
Clark was assigned a position in the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] and flew to [[Vietnam]] on May 21, 1969 during the U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]]. He worked as a staff officer, collecting data and helping in operations planning, and was awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] for his work with the staff. Clark was then given command of A Company, 1st Battalion, 16th Infantry of the 1st Infantry Division in January 1970. In February, only one month into his command, he was shot four times by a [[Viet Cong]] soldier with an [[AK-47]]. The wounded Clark shouted orders to his men, who [[counterattack]]ed and defeated the Viet Cong force. Clark had injuries to his right shoulder, right hand, right hip, and right leg, and was sent to [[Valley Forge General Hospital|Valley Forge Army Hospital]] in [[Phoenixville, Pennsylvania|Phoenixville]], [[Pennsylvania]] to recuperate. He was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for his actions during the encounter.<ref>Felix, pp. 80<U+2013>84.</ref>

Clark had converted to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], his wife Gertrude's religion, while in Vietnam. He saw his son, Wesley Clark, Jr., for the first time while at the Valley Forge Hospital.<ref>Felix, pp. 85<U+2013>87.</ref> Clark commanded C Company, 6th Battalion, 32nd Armor, [[194th Armored Brigade (United States)|194th Armored Brigade]], a company composed entirely of wounded soldiers, at Fort Knox. Clark has said this command is what made him decide to continue his military career past the four-year commitment required by West Point, which would have concluded in 1971. Clark completed his Armor Officer Advanced Course while at Fort Knox, taking additional elective courses and writing an article that won the Armor Association Writing Award. His next posting was to the office of the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], where he worked in the "Modern Volunteer Army" program from May to July 1971. He then served as an instructor in the Department of Social Sciences at West Point for three years from July 1971 to 1974.<ref name="confirmbio">Detailed resume included with his nomination before the Senate Armed Services Committee, First Session, 105th Congress. July 9, 1997.</ref><ref>Felix, pp. 88<U+2013>95.</ref>

Clark graduated from the [[Command and General Staff College]] (CGSC), earning his military [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]] degree in [[military science]] from the CGSC with a [[thesis]] on American policies of [[gradualism]] in the Vietnam War. Clark's theory was one of applying force swiftly, which was being advocated by many soldiers at the time, a concept that would eventually become established as U.S. national security policy in the form of the [[Weinberger Doctrine]] and its successor, the [[Powell Doctrine]]. Clark was promoted to [[major (United States)|major]] upon his graduation from the CGSC.<ref>Felix, pp. 95<U+2013>97.</ref>

===Post-Vietnam===
In 1975, Clark was appointed a [[White House Fellows|White House Fellow]] in the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) as a special assistant to its director, [[James Thomas Lynn]]. He was one of only 14 appointed out of 2,307 applicants.<ref>"White House Assigns Fellow to OMB Office," ''Arkansas Democrat-Gazette'', June 29, 1975.</ref> Lynn also gave Clark a six-week assignment to assist [[John Otho Marsh, Jr.|John Marsh]], then a counselor to the President. Clark was approached during his fellowship to help push for a memorial to Vietnam veterans. He worked with the movement that ultimately helped lead to the creation of the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Clark served in two commands with the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] based in Germany from August 1976 to February 1978, first as S-3 of the 3rd Battalion 35th Armor and then as S-3 of the entire 3rd Brigade.<ref name="confirmbio"/> Clark's brigade commander while in the former position said Clark was "singularly outstanding, notably superb." Regarding his term as brigade commander, one of his battalion commanders called Clark the "most brilliant and gifted officer [he'd] ever known."<ref>Felix, pp. 97<U+2013>102.</ref> He was awarded the [[Meritorious Service Medal (United States)|Meritorious Service Medal]] for his work with the division.

The brigade commander had also said that "word of Major Clark's exceptional talent spread", and in one case reached the desk of then [[Supreme Allied Commander]] [[Alexander Haig]]. Haig personally selected Clark to serve as a special assistant on his staff, a post he held from February 1978 to June 1979. While on staff at [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SHAPE]], Clark wrote policy reports and coordinated two multinational military exercises. As a result of his work on Haig's staff, Clark was promoted to [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] and was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]]. After his European post, he moved on to [[Fort Carson|Fort Carson, Colorado]] where he served first as the [[executive officer]] of the 1st Brigade, [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]] from August 1979 to February 1980, then as the commander of the [[77th Armor Regiment (United States)|1st Battalion, 77th Armor]], 4th Infantry Division from February 1980 to July 1982. According to the American journalist [[David Halberstam]], the commander at Fort Carson, then Major General John Hudacheck, had a reputation of disliking West Point graduates and fast-rising officers such as Clark.<ref>Felix, p. 105. "The commander at Fort Carson, Gen. John Hudacheck, had a well-known aversion to West Point cadets and fast-risers like Clark. Even though Clark made quick and outstanding progress with the armor unit, Hudacheck expressed his attitude towards Clark by omitting him from a list of battalion commanders selected to greet a congressional delegation visiting the base." [[Colin Powell]] also ran afoul of Maj. Gen. Hudacheck<U+2014>see Colin Powell, 'My American Journey.'</ref><ref>''War in a Time of Peace: Bush, Clinton, and the Generals'', by David Halberstam, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2001, pp. 432<U+2013>433.</ref> After two years of not making the list to rise from battalion commander to brigade commander, Clark attended the [[National War College]]. After studying there from June 1982 to 1983, Clark graduated and was promoted to full [[colonel (United States)|colonel]] in October 1983.<ref name="confirmbio"/><ref>Felix, pp. 102<U+2013>110.</ref>

[[File:Wesley Clark 1star portrait.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Brigadier General Clark as a commander at Fort Irwin]]
Following his graduation, Clark worked in Washington, D.C. from July 1983 to 1984 in the offices of the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Chief and Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the United States Army]], and earned a second Legion of Merit for his work. He then served as the Operations Group commander at the [[Fort Irwin Military Reservation]] from August 1984 to June 1986. He was awarded yet another Legion of Merit and a Meritorious Service Medal for his work at Fort Irwin, and was then given a brigade command at Fort Carson in 1986. He commanded the 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry there from April 1986 to March 1988. Veneta Clark, Wesley's mother, fell ill as he began this command and died on [[Mother's Day]] in 1986. After Fort Carson, Clark returned to the Command and General Staff College to direct and further develop the Battle Command Training Program (BCTP) there until October 1989. The BCTP was created to teach senior officers war-fighting skills, according to the commanding general at the time.<ref>Further information on the BCTP can be found at [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/ctc-bctp.htm Warfighter / Battle Command Training Program Exercises]. ''Global Security''. Retrieved February 9, 2007.</ref> On November 1, 1989, Clark was promoted to [[Brigadier General#United States|brigadier general]].<ref name="confirmbio"/><ref>Felix, pp. 110<U+2013>116.</ref>

Clark returned to Fort Irwin and commanded the [[Fort Irwin Military Reservation|National Training Center]] (NTC) from October 1989 to 1991. The [[Gulf War]] occurred during Clark's command, and many [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] divisional round-out brigades trained under his command. Multiple generals commanding American forces in [[Iraq]] and [[Kuwait]] said Clark's training helped bring about results in the field and that he had successfully begun training a new generation of the military that had moved past Vietnam-era strategy. He was awarded yet another Legion of Merit for his "personal efforts" that were "instrumental in maintaining" the NTC, according to the citation. He served in yet another planning post after this, as the Deputy Chief of Staff for Concepts, Doctrine, and Developments at [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command|Training and Doctrine Command]] (TRADOC) at [[Fort Monroe|Fort Monroe, Virginia]]. While there, he helped the commanding general of TRADOC prepare the army for war and develop new post-[[Cold War]] strategies. One of Clark's major pushes was for technological advancement in the army to establish a [[computer network|digital network]] for military command that Clark called the "digitization of the battlefield."<ref>"Digitization: Key to Landpower Dominance," by Wesley Clark for ''Army'' magazine, November 1993.</ref> Clark was promoted to [[Major General#United States|Major General]] in October 1992 at the end of this command.<ref name="confirmbio"/><ref>Felix, pp. 116<U+2013>120.</ref>

====Fort Hood and the Waco Siege====

Clark's divisional command came with the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] at [[Fort Hood]], [[Texas]]. Clark was in command during three separate deployments of forces from Fort Hood for peacekeeping in Kuwait.

Some critics, such as left-wing ''[[CounterPunch]]'' and right-wing [[FrontPage Magazine|FrontPageMag.com]], have made allegations that Clark was, to some degree, involved in the Waco siege, where 74 [[Branch Davidian]] followers were killed during the final raid, including their leader [[David Koresh]]. Groups making allegations of Clark's involvement note that Clark's second-in-command at the time, future General [[Peter Schoomaker]], met with then-Texas governor [[Ann Richards]] and then-[[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Janet Reno]], who were also allegedly involved with the siege. They also note that some military technology and personnel from Fort Hood, including two [[M1 Abrams]] tanks, were lent<ref>[http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=9522 Wesley Clark: General Issues] by Lowell Pointe for Frontpage Magazine on August 25, 2003.

====United States Southern Command====
Army regulations set a so-called "ticking clock" upon the promotion to a three-star general , essentially requiring that Clark be promoted to another post within 2 years from his initial promotion or retire.<ref>Felix, p. 131</ref><!-- The average tour length for three-star positions are three years depending on the position.--> This deadline ended in 1996 and Clark said he was not optimistic about receiving such a promotion because rumors at the time suggested General [[Dennis Reimer]] did not want to recommend him for promotion although "no specific reason was given".<ref name="wmr68">Clark, ''Waging'', p. 68.</ref> According to Clark's book, General Robert Scales said that it was likely Clark's reputation of intelligence within the military was responsible for feelings of resentment against him from other generals. Clark was named to the [[United States Southern Command]] (USSOUTHCOM) post despite these rumors. Congress approved his promotion to full [[general (United States)|general]] in June 1996, and General [[John M. Shalikashvili]] signed the order. Clark said he was not the original nominee, but the first officer chosen "hadn't been accepted for some reason."<ref name="wmr68"/><ref>Felix, pp. 131<U+2013>134.</ref>

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====
{{See also|War in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Dayton Agreement}}
Clark began planning work for responses to the [[war in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] upon his appointment in 1994 as the Director, Strategic Plans and Policy (J5) on the JCS staff. While collecting information to outline military options for resolving the conflict, Clark met with [[Army of Republika Srpska|Bosnian Serb military]] leaders including [[Ratko Mladi<U+0107>]], who was later accused of [[war crime]]s and [[genocide]]. Clark was photographed exchanging hats with Mladi<U+0107>, and the photo drew controversy in the United States. A ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' story was published claiming Clark had made the visit despite a warning from the [[Ambassadors from the United States|U.S. ambassador]].<ref>Clark, ''Waging'', p. 38</ref> Some [[Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]] members privately said the incident was "like cavorting with [[Hermann G<U+00F6>ring]]."<ref>[http://www.zpub.com/un/Clark's%20Military%20Record.htm Clark's Military Record] by KATHARINE Q.

Clark was sent to Bosnia by [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[William Perry]] to serve as the military advisor to a diplomatic negotiating team headed by assistant [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Richard Holbrooke]]. Holbrooke later described Clark's position as "complicated" because while it presented him with future possibilities it "might put him into career-endangering conflicts with more senior officers."<ref>''To End a War'' by Richard Holbrooke, New York: Random House, 1999, p. 9.</ref> While the team was driving along a mountain road during the first week, the road gave way, and one of the vehicles fell over a cliff carrying passengers including Holbrooke's deputy, [[Robert Frasure]], a deputy assistant Secretary of Defense, Joseph Kruzel, and [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Nelson Drew. Clark and Holbrooke attempted to crawl down the mountain, but were driven back by sniper fire. Once the fire ceased, Clark [[Abseiling|rappelled]] down the mountain to collect the bodies of two dead Americans left by Bosnian forces that had taken the remaining wounded to a nearby hospital. After returning to Washington D.C. for funeral services, the negotiations continued and the team eventually reached the [[Dayton Agreement]] at the [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Ohio]] and later signed it in [[Paris]] on December 14, 1995.<ref>Felix, pp. 126<U+2013>129</ref>

Clark returned to the European theater and the Balkans following his [[United States Southern Command|USSOUTHCOM]] position when he was appointed to [[United States European Command|U.S. European Command]] in the summer of 1997 by President Clinton. He was, as with SOUTHCOM, not the original nominee for the position. The Army had already selected another general for the post. Because President Clinton and General Shalikashvili believed Clark was the best man for the post, Clark eventually got the nomination. Shalikashvili noted he "had a very strong role in [Clark's] last two jobs."<ref>"Wesley K.

====Kosovo War====
{{See also|Kosovo War|1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia}}
The largest event of Clark's tenure as SACEUR was NATO's confrontation with the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in the [[Kosovo War]]. The [[United Nations Security Council]] introduced [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1199|Resolution 1199]] calling for an end to hostilities in [[Kosovo]], and Richard Holbrooke again tried to negotiate a peace. This process came to an unsuccessful end, however, following the [[Ra<U+010D>ak incident]]. Then U.S. Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]] tried to force Yugoslavia into allowing separation of Kosovo with the [[Rambouillet Agreement]], which Yugoslavia refused. Clark was at the Rambouillet talks and tried to convince Yugoslavian president [[Slobodan Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>]] by telling him "there's an activation order. And if they tell me to bomb you, I'm going to bomb you good." Clark later said Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107> launched into an emotional tirade against [[Albanians]] and said that they'd been "handled" in the 1940s by [[ethnic cleansing|killing large numbers of them]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/kosovo/interviews/clark.html |title=Interview with Wesley Clark for PBS '&#39;Frontline'&#39; |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-15}}</ref><ref>Felix, pp. 138<U+2013>140.</ref>

[[File:Clark briefs NATO May 9.JPEG|thumb|Clark briefing two fighter squadrons deployed to [[Aviano Air Base]] in Italy on May 9, 1999]]
Clark started the bombings codenamed [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Operation Allied Force]] on March 24, 1999 on orders to try and enforce UN Resolution 1199 following Yugoslavia's refusal of the Rambouillet Agreement. However, critics note that Resolution 1199 was a call for cessation of hostilities and does not authorize any organization to take military action. Secretary of Defense [[William Cohen]] felt that Clark had powerful allies at the [[White House]] such as President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that were allowing him to circumvent [[The Pentagon]] in promoting his strategic ideas, while Clark felt he was not being included enough in discussions with the [[National Command Authority]], leading Clark to describe himself as "just a NATO officer who also reported to the United States".<ref>Clark, ''Waging'', p. 342.</ref> This command conflict came to a ceremonial head when Clark was not initially invited to a summit in Washington, D.C. to commemorate NATO's 50th anniversary, despite being its supreme military commander. Clark eventually secured an invitation to the summit, but was told by Cohen to say nothing about ground troops, and Clark agreed.<ref>Clark, ''Waging'', p. 269.</ref>

Clark returned to [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SHAPE]] following the summit and briefed the press on the continued bombing operations. A reporter from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' asked a question about the effect of bombings on Serbian forces, and Clark noted that merely counting the number of opposing troops did not show Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>'s true losses because he was bringing in reinforcements. Many American news organizations capitalized on the remark in a way Clark said "distorted the comment" with headlines such as "NATO Chief Admits Bombs Fail to Stem Serb Operations" in ''[[The New York Times]]''. Clark later defended his remarks, saying this was a "complete misunderstanding of my statement and of the facts," and President Clinton agreed Clark's remarks had been misconstrued. Regardless, Clark received a call the following evening from General [[Hugh Shelton]] who said he had been told by Secretary Cohen to deliver a piece of guidance verbatim. "Get your fucking face off the TV. No more briefings, period. That's it."<ref>Clark, ''Waging'', p. 273.</ref><ref>Felix, pp. 140<U+2013>143.</ref>

Operation Allied Force experienced another problem when [[US bombing of the People's Republic of China embassy in Belgrade|NATO bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]] on May 7, 1999. The operation had been organized against numerous Serbian targets, including "Target 493, the Federal Procurement and Supply Directorate Headquarters", although the intended target building was actually 300 meters away from the targeted area. The embassy was located at this mistaken target, and three Chinese journalists were killed. Clark's intelligence officer called Clark taking full responsibility and offering to resign, but Clark declined, saying it was not the officer's fault. Secretary Cohen and [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|CIA Director]] [[George Tenet]] took responsibility the next day. Tenet would later explain in testimony before the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] on July 22, 1999 that the targeting system used street addresses, which gave inaccurate positions for air bombings and that the various databases of off-limit targets did not have the up-to-date address for the relatively new embassy location, although there were some that did not accept this explanation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1766 |title=U.S. Media Overlook Expose on Chinese Embassy Bombing |publisher=Fair.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/cia/public_affairs/speeches/1999/dci_speech_072299.html|title=DCI Statement on the Belgrade Chinese Embassy Bombing House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Open Hearing|accessdate=2006-10-04|last= Tenet|first= George|authorlink= George Tenet|date=1999-07-22|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency}}</ref><ref>Clark, ''Waging'', pp. 296<U+2013>297.</ref>

The bombing campaign was ended on June 10, 1999 on the order of [[Secretary General of NATO]] [[Javier Solana]] after Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107> complied with conditions the international community had set and Yugoslav forces began to withdraw from Kosovo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/kosovo/press/p990610b.htm |title=Press Briefing by Javier Solana |publisher=Nato.int |date=1999-06-10 |accessdate=2011-08-15}}</ref> [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244]] was adopted that same day, placing Kosovo under [[United Nations]] administration and authorizing a [[Kosovo Force|Kosovo peacekeeping force]].<ref>[http://www.unmikonline.org/press/reports/N9917289.pdf Resolution 1244]{{dead link|date=August 2011}} adopted by the United Nations Security Council on June 10, 1999.</ref> NATO claimed to have suffered no combat deaths<ref name="roblect">[http://www.princeton.edu/~lisd/events/talks/Roberts_Lecture.pdf The Impact of the Laws of War in Contemporary Conflicts] (PDF) by Adam Roberts on April 10, 2003 at a seminar at Princeton University titled "The Emerging International System&nbsp;<U+2013> Actors, Interactions, Perceptions, Security".

Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>'s term in office in Yugoslavia was coming to an end, and the elections that came on September 24, 2000 were protested due to allegations of fraud and rigged elections. This all came to a head on October 5 in the so-called [[5th October (Serbia)|Bulldozer Revolution]]. Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107> resigned on October 7.

=====Pristina International Airport=====
One of Clark's most debated decisions during his SACEUR command was his [[Incident at Pristina|attempted operation]] to attack Russian troops at [[Pristina International Airport]] immediately after the end of the Kosovo War.A joint NATO-Russia peacekeeping operation was supposed to police Kosovo. Russia wanted their peacekeeping force to operate independent of NATO, but NATO refused. British forces were supposed to occupy Pristina International Airport, but a contingent of Russian troops arrived before they did and took control of the airport. Clark called then-Secretary General of NATO [[Javier Solana]], and was told "you have transfer of authority" in the area. General Clark then issued an order for the NATO troops to attack and "overpower" the armed Russian troops, but [[James Blunt|Captain Blunt]]<!--Blunt is correct - Blunt is stage name only--> leading the British troops questioned this order,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11753050 |title="Singer James Blunt 'prevented World War III'" |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2010-11-14 |accessdate=2011-08-15}}</ref> and was supported in this decision by the British commander of the Kosovo Force, General [[Mike Jackson]], who refused to sanction the attack, reportedly saying "I'm not going to start the [[Third World War]] for you."<ref>{{cite web|last=Grice |first=Elizabeth |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1561897/General-Sir-Mike-Jackson-speaks-out.html |title="General Sir Mike Jackson speaks out" |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2007-09-01 |accessdate=2011-08-15}}</ref><ref>[http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/fivelive/pienaar/pienaar_20101114-2008d.mp3 "James Blunt, General Sir Mike Jackson; 14 Nov 10"]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}, BBC "Pienaar's Politics" (long audio file),</ref> Jackson has said he refused to take action because he did not believe it was worth the risk of a military confrontation with the Russians, instead insisting that troops encircle the airfield. After two days of standoff and negotiations, NATO agreed to an independent Russian peacekeeping force, and Russia relinquished control of the airport.
The refusal was criticized by some senior US military personnel, with American General [[Hugh Shelton]] calling Jackson's refusal "troubling," and hearings in the [[United States Senate]] suggested it may amount to [[insubordination]], with Senator [[John Warner]] suggesting holding hearings regarding whether the refusal was legal and potentially changing those rules if it was.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/10/world/us-general-was-overruled-in-kosovo.html "U.S. General Was Overruled in Kosovo"], NY Times, September 10, 1999]</ref> British [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] [[Charles Guthrie, Baron Guthrie of Craigiebank|Charles Guthrie]] agreed with Jackson and told Clark this on the day Jackson refused the order.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/newshour/conversation/jan-june01/clark_06-15.html Online Newshour: Waging Modern War] interview by Margaret Warner for PBS on June 15, 2001.

===Retirement===
Clark received another call from General Shelton in July 1999 in which he was told that Secretary Cohen wanted Clark to leave his command in April 2000. Clark was surprised by this, as he saw SACEURs as being expected to serve at least 3 years and often asked to stay on for a 4th, while this date would give him less than 3 years of service at the post.<ref>Clark, ''Waging'', p. 408.</ref> Clark was told that this was necessary because General [[Joseph Ralston]] was leaving his post as the [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and would need another 4-star command within 60 days or he would be forced to retire. Ralston was not going to be appointed [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] due to an extramarital affair in his past, and the SACEUR position was said to be the last potential post for him.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/US/9706/09/ralston.update/index.html Ralston withdraws name from consideration] by Wolf Blitzer and Carl Rochelle on June 9, 1997.

==Civilian career==
Clark set himself three initial goals in civilian life<U+2014>to earn $40 million in the business world to let him practice [[philanthropy]], to become an [[adjunct professor]], and to become a [[professional golfer]]. Clark began a [[public speaker|public speaking tour]] in the summer of 2000 and approached several former government officials for advice on work after life in government, including [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]], [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Mack McLarty]], and [[Richard Holbrooke]]. Clark took McLarty's advice to move back to [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], [[Arkansas]], and took a position with the Stephens Group, an investment firm headquartered there. He took several other [[board of directors|board]] positions at defense-related firms, and in March 2003 he amicably left the Stephens Group to found Wesley K. Clark & Associates. Clark began writing, publishing two books<U+2014>''Waging Modern War'' and ''Winning Modern Wars''<U+2014>along with writing the [[foreword]]s for a series of military biographies, as well as a series of [[editorial]]s.<ref name="SA"/> He had amassed only about $3.1 million towards his $40 million goal by 2003, but began considering running for public office instead of pursuing his business career.<ref>Felix, pp. 154<U+2013>173.</ref>

===2004 presidential campaign===
{{Main|Wesley Clark presidential campaign, 2004}}
{{See also|Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2004|United States presidential election, 2004}}
Clark has said that he began to truly define his politics only after his military retirement in 2000 around the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]] that would give [[George W. Bush]] the presidency. Clark had a conversation with [[Condoleezza Rice]]. She told him that the war in Kosovo would have never taken place under a Bush administration. Clark found such an administration unsettling, as he had been selected for the SACEUR position because he believed more in the [[interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] policies of the Clinton administration. He said he would see it as a sign that things were "starting to go wrong" with American foreign policy if Bush was elected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stacks.msnbc.com/news/934709.asp?cp1=1 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030807175900/http://stacks.msnbc.com/news/934709.asp?cp1=1 |archivedate=2003-08-07 |title="The Last Word: Wesley Clark |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2003-08-07 |accessdate=2011-08-15}}</ref> Clark supported the administration's [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|War in Afghanistan]] in response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] but did not support the [[Iraq War]].

[[weapons of mass destruction|WMD]] or regime change," and believes "the connection to the War on Terrorism was not shown."<ref>[http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2003/8/23/154853.shtml General Wesley Clark: A Call to Arms] from ''NewsMax'' by Dave Eberhart on August 25, 2003.</ref><ref>Felix, pp. 189<U+2013>190.</ref>

Clark met with a group of wealthy [[New York]] Democrats including [[Alan Patricof]] to tell them he was considering running for the presidency in the 2004 election. Patricof, a supporter of [[Al Gore]] in 2000, met with all the Democratic candidates and ultimately supported Clark in 2004. Clark has said that he voted for Al Gore in 2000, but has voted for Republicans such as [[Ronald Reagan]], held equal esteem for [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and [[Harry S. Truman]], and had been a registered [[Independent (United States)|independent]] voter throughout his military career. Ultimately as Clark himself put it, however, he decided he was a Democrat because "I was pro-[[affirmative action]], I was [[pro-choice]], I was pro-[[Education in the United States|education]]... I'm pro-[[Health care in the United States|health care]]... I realized I was either going to be the loneliest Republican in America or I was going to be a happy Democrat."<ref>"In His Own Words".

Clark's loyalty to the Democratic Party was questioned by some as soon as he entered the race. Senator [[Joe Lieberman]] called Clark's party choice a matter of "political convenience, not conviction." Republican Governor [[Bill Owens (Colorado politician)|Bill Owens]] of [[Colorado]] and [[University of Denver]] president [[Marc Holtzman]] have claimed Clark once said "I would have been a Republican if [[Karl Rove]] had returned my phone calls." Clark later claimed he was simply joking, but both Owens and Holtzman said the remark was delivered "very directly" and "wasn't a joke." [[Katharine Q. Seelye]] wrote that many believed Clark had only chosen to be a Democrat in 2004 because it was "the only party that did not have a nominee."<ref name="drummer"/> On May 11, 2001, Clark also delivered a speech to the [[Pulaski County, Arkansas|Pulaski County]] Republican Party in Arkansas saying he was "very glad we've got the great team in office, men like [[Colin Powell]], [[Donald Rumsfeld|Don Rumsfeld]], [[Dick Cheney]], Condoleezza Rice, [[Paul O'Neill (cabinet member)|Paul O'Neill]]<U+2014>people I know very well<U+2014>our president George W.

[[File:Wesley Clark college 01.jpg|thumb|Clark speaking to a group of college students during the 2004 campaign]]
Clark, coming from a non-political background, had no position papers to define his agenda for the public. Once in the campaign, however, several volunteers established a network of connections with the media, and Clark began to explain his stances on a variety of issues. He was, as he had told ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in October, pro-choice and pro-affirmative action. He called for a repeal of recent Bush [[tax cut]]s for people earning more than $200,000 and suggested providing healthcare for the uninsured by altering the current system rather than transferring to a completely new [[universal health care]] system. He backed environmental causes such as promising to reverse "scaled down rules" the Bush administration had applied to the [[Clean Air Act|Clean Air]] and [[Clean Water Act]]s and dealing with the potential effects of [[global warming]] by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, livestock flatulence and other sources. Clark also proposed a global effort to strengthen American relations with other nations, reviewing the [[USA PATRIOT Act|PATRIOT Act]], and investing $100 billion in [[homeland security]]. Finally, he put out a budget plan that claimed to save $2.35 trillion over ten years through a repeal of the Bush tax cuts, sharing the cost of the [[Iraq War]] with other nations, and cutting government waste.<ref>Felix, pp. 197<U+2013>199.</ref>

Some, such as Clark biographer Antonia Felix,<ref>Felix, p. 199, "Clark learned that his intellectual style of considering an issue from every angle and ruminating on several alternatives would not serve him well in the sound-bite format of modern political rhetoric."</ref> have speculated that Clark's inexperience at giving "[[soundbite]]" answers hurt him in the media during his primary campaign.<ref>[http://www.democraticunderground.com/articles/04/01/19_clark.html Wesley Clark: Mending our torn country into a nation again] by Jerseycoa on the DemocraticUnderground on January 19, 2004. Retrieved January 28, 2007.</ref> The day after he launched his campaign, for example, he was asked if he would have voted for the Iraq War Resolution, which granted President Bush the power to wage the Iraq War, a large issue in the 2004 campaign. Clark said, "At the time, I probably would have voted for it, but I think that's too simple a question," then "I don't know if I would have or not. I've said it both ways because when you get into this, what happens is you have to put yourself in a position<U+2014>on balance, I probably would have voted for it." Finally, Clark's [[press secretary]] clarified his position as "you said you would have voted for the resolution as leverage for a UN-based solution." After this series of responses, although Clark opposed the war, ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran a story with the headline "Clark Says He Would Have Voted for War".<ref>"Clark Says He Would Have Voted for War," ''The New York Times'', September 19, 2003.</ref> Clark was repeatedly portrayed as unsure on this critical issue by his opponents throughout the primary season, being forced to continue to clarify his position such as at the second primary debate when he said, "I think it's really embarrassing that a group of candidates up here are working on changing the leadership in this country and can't get their own story straight... I would have never voted for war. The war was an unnecessary war, it was an elective war, and it's been a huge strategic mistake for this country."<ref>"Clark Under Sharp Attack in Democratic Debate," ''The Washington Post'', October 10, 2003.</ref>

Another media incident started during the New Hampshire primary September 27, 2003, when Clark was asked by [[space shuttle]] astronaut [[Jay C. Buckey]] what his vision for the space program was after the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]]. Clark responded he was a great believer in the exploration of space but wanted a vision well beyond that of a new shuttle or space plane. "I would like to see mankind get off this planet. I'd like to know what's out there beyond the solar system." Clark thought such a vision could probably require a lifetime of research and development in various fields of science and technology. Then at the end of his remarks, Clark dropped a bombshell when he said "I still believe in [[mass-energy equivalence|{{nowrap|''E'' {{=}} ''mc''<U+00B2>}}]]. But I can't believe that in all of human history we'll never ever be able to go beyond the speed of light to reach where we want to go. I happen to believe that mankind can do it. I've argued with physicists about it. I've argued with best friends about it. I just have to believe it. It's my only faith-based initiative."<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.roswellproof.com/Gen_Wesley_Clark_FTL.html|title = transcript of remarks}}</ref> This led to a series of headlines deriding the response, such as "Beam Us Up, General Clark" in ''The New York Times'', "Clark is Light-Years Ahead of the Competition" in ''The Washington Post'', "General Relativity (Retired)" on the [[U.S. News & World Report]] website, and "Clark Campaigns at Light Speed" in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine.<ref>Felix, pp. 174<U+2013>175.</ref><ref>[http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,60629,00.html Clark Campaigns at Light Speed] by Brian McWilliams on September 30, 2003.

[[File:Clark Gert Seattle04.jpg|thumb|Clark ''(center)'' with his wife Gertrude ''(right)'' in [[Seattle, Washington]] on August 19, 2004]]
Several polls from September to November 2003 showed Clark leading the Democratic field of candidates or as a close second to [[Howard Dean]]. The [[John Edwards]] campaign brought on Hugh Shelton<U+2014>the general who had said Clark was made to leave the SACEUR post early due to "integrity and character issues"<U+2014>as an advisor, a move that drew criticism from the Clark campaign.<ref>[http://www.clark04.com/press/release/071/ Clark Communications Director questions John Edwards retaining Hugh Shelton]{{dead link|date=August 2011}} by Matt Bennett, hosted on Clark04.com on November 11, 2003. Retrieved February 2, 2007.</ref> Since Dean consistently polled in the lead in the [[Iowa caucus]]es, Clark opted out of participating in the caucuses entirely to focus on later primaries instead. The [[Iowa Democratic Party caucuses, 2004|2004 Iowa caucuses]] marked a turning point in the campaign for the Democratic nomination, however, as front-runners Dean and [[Dick Gephardt]] garnered results far lower than expected, and [[John Kerry]] and John Edwards' campaigns benefited in Clark's absence. Although Clark performed reasonably well in later primaries, such as a tie for third place with Edwards in the [[New Hampshire primary]] and narrowly winning the [[Oklahoma]] primary over Edwards, he saw his third-place finish in [[Tennessee]] and distant third in [[Virginia]] as signs that he had lost [[Southern United States|the South]], which his campaign had been centered on. He withdrew from the race on February 11, 2004 and announced his endorsement of John Kerry at a rally in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] on February 13.<ref>[http://clark04.com/speeches/044/ Wes Clark Endorses John Kerry]{{dead link|date=August 2011}} by Wesley Clark on February 13, 2004.

===McCain military service controversy===
On June 29, 2008, Clark made comments on [[Face the Nation]] that were critical of Republican [[John McCain]], calling into question the notion that McCain's military service alone had given him experience relevant to being president. "I certainly honor [McCain's] service as a prisoner of war," Clark said, "but he hasn't held executive responsibility. That large squadron in the navy that he commanded--it wasn't a wartime squadron. He hasn't been in there and ordered the bombs to fall."<ref>{{cite web|author=July 01, 2008 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRwsk56lN44 |title=TPMtv: Wesley Clark Hyperventorama |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2009-03-05}}</ref> When moderator [[Bob Schieffer]] noted that Obama had no military experience to prepare him for the presidency nor had he "ridden in a fighter plane and gotten shot down,<U+201D> Clark responded that, ultimately, Obama had not based his presidential bid on his military experience, as McCain has done throughout his campaign. Clark's retort, however, is what drew rebuke.

However, Clark has received the backing of several prominent liberal groups such as MoveOn.org and military veteran groups such as VoteVets.org; Obama ultimately stated that Clark's comments were "inartful" and were not intended to attack McCain's military service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0708/Obama_Clark_was_inartful.html |title=Retrieved July 7, 2008 |publisher=Politico.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-05}}</ref> In the days following the controversial interview, Clark went on several news programs to reiterate his true admiration and heartfelt support for McCain's military service as a fellow veteran who had been wounded in combat.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/politics/2008/07/01/tsr.intv.clark.cnn?iref=videosearch |title=Retrieved July 8, 2008 |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=2006-11-16 |accessdate=2009-03-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/25456108#25479549 |title=Retrieved July 8, 2008 |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=2009-03-05}}</ref> In each program, Clark reminded the commentator and the viewing public that while he honors McCain's service, he has serious concerns about McCain's judgment in matters of national security policy, calling McCain "untested and untried."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/25456108#25139036 |title=Retrieved July 8, 2008 |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=2009-03-05}}</ref>
