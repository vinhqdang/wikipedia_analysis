'''Sir Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell''' [[Order of Merit|OM]], [[Order of St Michael and St George|GCMG]], [[Royal Victorian Order|GCVO]], [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] ([[22 February]] [[1857]] &ndash; [[8 January]] [[1941]]), also known as '''B-P''', was [[Lieutenant-General (UK)|Lieutenant-General]] in the [[British Army]], writer, and founder of the [[Scouting|Scouting Movement]].

After having been educated at [[Charterhouse School]], Baden-Powell served in the [[British Army]] from 1876 until 1910 in India and Africa. In 1899, during the [[Second Boer War]] in [[South Africa]], Baden-Powell successfully defended the city in the [[Siege of Mafeking]]. Several of his military books, written for [[military]] [[reconnaissance]] and scout training in his African years, were also read by boys. Based on those earlier books, he wrote ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'', published in 1908 by [[Cyril Arthur Pearson|Pearson]], for youth readership. During writing, he tested his ideas through a [[Brownsea Island Scout camp|camping trip on Brownsea Island]] in 1907, which is now seen as the beginning of Scouting. 

After his marriage with [[Olave Baden-Powell|Olave St Clair Soames]], Baden-Powell, his sister [[Agnes Baden-Powell]] and notably his wife actively gave guidance to the Scouting Movement and the [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout|Girl Guides Movement]]. Baden-Powell lived his last years in [[Nyeri]], [[Kenya]], where he died in 1941.

==Personal history==
===Early life===
Baden-Powell was born as Robert Stephenson Smyth Powell, or more familiarly as Stephe Powell, at 9 Stanhope Street, [[Paddington]] in [[London]], [[England]], [[UK]] on [[1857-02-22]]. From previous marriages, his father [[Reverend]] [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Baden Powell]] ([[1796-08-22]] &ndash; [[1860-06-11]]), a [[Savilian chair of geometry|Savilian professor]] of [[geometry]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], already had four adult children. In 1841, Reverend Powell married Henrietta Grace Smyth ([[1824-09-03]] &ndash; [[1914-10-13]]), and quickly had [[Warington Baden-Powell|Warington]] and [[George Baden-Powell|George]] (both 1847), Augustus (1849) and Francis (1850). After three further children who died when very young, they had Stephe, [[Agnes Baden-Powell|Agnes]] (1858) and Baden (1860). The three youngest children and the often ill Augustus were close friends. Reverend Powell died when Stephe was three, and as tribute to his father, the family name Powell was changed to Baden-Powell. Subsequently, Stephe was raised by his mother, a strong woman who was determined that her children would succeed. Baden-Powell would say of her in 1933 "The whole secret of my getting on lay with my mother."<ref name="jeal">{{cite book | first = Tim | last = Jeal | authorlink = Tim Jeal | title = [[Baden-Powell (book)|Baden-Powell]] | publisher = Hutchinson | year = 1989 }}</ref><ref name="palstra">{{cite book | first = Theo P.M. | last = Palstra | title = Baden-Powel, zijn leven en werk | publisher = De Nationale Padvindersraad | city = Den Haag | month = April | year = 1967 }}</ref><ref name="drewery">{{cite book | first = Mary | last = Drewery | title = Baden-Powell: the man who lived twice | publisher = [[Hodder and Stoughton]] | city = London | year = 1975 | id = ISBN 0-340-18102-8 }}</ref>

After attending [[Rose Hill School]], [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]], during which his favourite brother Augustus died, Stephe Baden-Powell was awarded a scholarship to [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]], which is a prestigious [[public school (England)|public school]]. His first introduction to Scouting skills was through stalking and cooking game while avoiding teachers in the nearby woods, which were strictly out-of-bounds. He also played the [[piano]] and [[violin]], was an [[Ambidexterity|ambidextrous]] artist, and enjoyed [[acting]]. Holidays were spent on [[yachting]] or [[canoeing]] expeditions with his brothers.<ref name='jeal'/>

===Military career===
In 1876, R.S.S. Baden-Powell, as he styled himself then, joined the [[13th Light Dragoons|13th Hussars]] in [[India]] with the rank of [[Lieutenant]]. He enhanced and honed his [[Reconnaissance|military scouting]] skills amidst the [[Zulu]] tribesmen in the early [[1880s]] in the [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal province]] of [[South Africa]], where his regiment had been posted, and where he was [[mentioned in despatches]]. During one of his travels, he came across a large string of wooden beads, worn by the Zulu king [[Dinizulu]], which was later incorporated into the [[Wood Badge]] training programme he started after he founded the Scouting movement. Baden-Powell's skills impressed his superiors and he was promoted to [[Brevet (military)|Brevet Major]] as Military Secretary and senior [[Aide-de-camp]] of the Commander-in-Chief and Governor of Malta, his uncle General Sir [[Henry Augustus Smyth]].<ref name='jeal'/>

Baden-Powell was posted in Malta for three years, also working as intelligence officer for the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] for the Director of [[Military Intelligence]].<ref name='jeal'/> He frequently travelled disguised as a [[Insect collecting|butterfly collector]], incorporating plans of military installations into his drawings of butterfly wings. He then led a successful campaign in [[Ashanti Confederacy|Ashanti]], Africa, and at the age of 40 was promoted to lead the 5th [[Dragoon]] Guards in 1897 in India.<ref name='barrett'>{{cite book | first = C.R.B. | last = Barrett | title = History of The XIII. Hussars | publisher = William Blackwood and Sons | location = Edinburgh and London | year = 1911 | url = http://www.pinetreeweb.com/bp-hussars.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-02}}</ref> A few years later he wrote a small manual, entitled ''Aids to Scouting,'' a summary of lectures he had given on the subject of military scouting, to help train recruits. Using this and other methods he was able to train them to think independently, use their initiative, and survive in the wilderness.

He returned to South Africa prior to the [[Second Boer War]] and was engaged in actions against the Zulus. By this time, he had been promoted as the youngest [[colonel]] in the [[British army]]. He was responsible for the organisation of a force of frontiersmen to assist the regular army. Whilst arranging this, he was trapped in the [[Siege of Mafeking]], and surrounded by a Boer army, at times in excess of 8,000 men. Although wholly outnumbered, the garrison withstood the siege for 217 days. Much of this is attributable to cunning military deceptions instituted at Baden-Powell's behest as commander of the garrison. Fake minefields were planted and his soldiers were ordered to simulate avoiding non-existent [[barbed wire]] while moving between trenches.<ref>See Jon Latimer, ''Deception in War'', London: John Murray, 2001, pp.32-5.</ref> Baden-Powell did most of the reconnaissance work himself.<ref name="boer">{{cite web | last = Conan-Doyle | first = Sir Arthur | authorlink = Arthur Conan Doyle |year = 1901 | url = http://www.pinetreeweb.com/conan-doyle-mafeking.htm | title = The Siege of Mafeking | publisher = PineTree.web | accessdate = 2006-11-17}}</ref>

[[Image:Baden Powell.jpg|right|thumb|Baden-Powell on patriotic postcard in 1900]]
During the siege, a [[Mafeking Cadet Corps|cadet corps]], consisting of white boys below fighting age, was used to stand guard, carry messages, assist in hospitals and so on, freeing the men for military service. Although Baden-Powell did not form this cadet corps himself, and there is no evidence that he took much notice of them during the Siege, he was sufficiently impressed with both their courage and the equanimity with which they performed their tasks to use them later as an object lesson in the first chapter of ''Scouting for Boys''. The siege was lifted in the [[Relief of Mafeking]] on [[May 16]], [[1900]]. Promoted to [[Major-General]], Baden-Powell became a national hero.<ref name="NPG">{{cite web | url=http://www.npg.org.uk/live/wobaden.asp | title = Robert Baden-Powell: Defender of Mafeking and Founder of the Boy Scouts and the Girl Guides | work = Past Exhibition Archive | publisher = [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]] | accessdate = 2006-11-17}}</ref> After organising the [[South African Constabulary]] (police), he returned to England to take up a post as [[Inspector General]] of Cavalry in 1903.

Although he could doubtlessly have become [[Field Marshal (UK)|Field Marshal]], Baden-Powell decided to retire from the Army in 1910 with the rank of Lieutenant-General on the advice of [[Edward VII of England|King Edward VII]], who suggested that he could better serve his country by promoting Scouting.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wivenhoe.gov.uk/Orgs/WSGA/about_badenpowell.htm | title = Lord Robert Baden-Powell "B-P" <U+2013> Chief Scout of the World | work = The Wivenhoe Encyclopedia | accessdate = 2006-11-17}}</ref>

On the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, Baden-Powell put himself at the disposal of the War Office. No command, however, was given him, for, as [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] said: "he could lay his hand on several competent divisional generals but could find no one who could carry on the invaluable work of the Boy Scouts."<ref name='saunders'> {{cite book | first = Hilary | last = Saint George Saunders | title = The Left Handshake |chapter=Chapter II, ENTERPRISE, Lord Baden-Powell| publisher = | location = | year = 1948 | url = http://pinetreeweb.com/bp-memorial.htm |accessdate=2007-01-02}}</ref> It was widely rumoured that Baden-Powell was engaged in spying, and intelligence officers took great care to foster and [[wiktionary:inculcate|inculcate]] the myth.<ref name="matebele">{{cite web | last = Baden-Powell| first = Sir Robert | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1915 | url = http://www.pinetreeweb.com/bp-adventure01.htm | title = My Adventures as a Spy | publisher = PineTree.web | accessdate = 2006-11-17}}</ref>

===Family life===
[[Image:Olave St Clair Soames.jpg|right|thumb|Olave Baden-Powell as Chief Guide for Britain in 1919, wearing the Silver Fish medal]]
In January 1912, Baden-Powell met the woman who would be his future wife, [[Olave Baden-Powell|Olave St Clair Soames]] on the ocean liner Arcadian heading for [[New York]] to start one of his Scouting World Tours.<ref name="olave">{{cite web | last = Baden-Powell| first= Olave | url =http://www.pinetreeweb.com/bp-olave-00.htm | title = Window on My Heart | work= The Autobiography of Olave, Lady Baden-Powell, G.B.E.as told to Mary Drewery| publisher= Hodder and Stoughton | accessdate = 2006-11-16}}</ref><ref name="olaverobert">{{cite web | author = | url =http://www.girlguides.ca/media/pdfs/14-3/14.3.1.7.pdf |format=| title = Fact Sheet: The Three Baden-Powell's: Robert, Agnes, and Olave |format = {{PDFlink|40KB}}|publisher= Girl Guides of Canada | accessdate = 2007-01-02}}</ref> She was a young woman of 23, while he was 55, a not uncommon age difference in [[Edwardian period|that time]], and they shared the same birthday. They became engaged in September of the same year, causing a media sensation due to Baden-Powell's fame. To avoid press intrusion, they married in secret on [[October 30]], [[1912]].<ref name="marriage">{{cite web | url = http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?mkey=mw83490 | title = Olave St Clair Baden-Powell (n<U+00E9>e Soames), Baroness Baden-Powell; Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell | publisher = National Portrait Gallery | accessdate = 2006-11-16}}</ref> The Scouts of England each donated a penny to buy Baden-Powell a wedding gift, a car (note that this is not the Rolls-Royce they were presented with in 1929). There is a monument to their marriage inside St Mary's Church, Brownsea Island.

Baden-Powell and Olave lived in [[Pax Hill]] near [[Bentley, Hampshire]] from about 1919 until 1939. The house was a gift of her father.<ref name="wade">{{cite web | last = Wade | first = Eileen K. | url = http://www.pinetreeweb.com/bp-pax-hill.htm | title = Pax Hill | publisher = PineTree Web | accessdate = 2006-11-16}}</ref> Directly after he had married, Baden-Powell had begun to have problems with his health, suffering bouts of illness. He complained of persistent headaches, which were considered by his doctor to be of [[psychosomatic]] origin and treated with [[dream analysis]].<ref name="jeal"/> The headaches subsided upon his moving into a makeshift bedroom set up on his balcony. In 1934, his [[prostate]] was removed.

In 1939, he and his wife moved to a cottage he had commissioned in [[Nyeri]], [[Kenya]], near [[Mount Kenya]], where he had previously been to recuperate. The small one-room house, which he named ''Paxtu'', was located on the grounds of the [[Outspan Hotel]], owned by [[Eric Sherbrooke Walker]], Baden-Powell's first private secretary and one of the first Scout inspectors.<ref name='jeal'/> Walker also owned the [[Treetops Hotel]], approx 17&nbsp;km out in the [[Aberdare Mountains]], often visited by Baden-Powell and people of the [[Happy Valley set]]. The Paxtu cottage is integrated into the Outspan Hotel buildings and serves as a small Scouting Museum.

Baden-Powell died on [[January 8]], [[1941]] and is buried in Nyeri on St Peter's Cemetery ({{coord|-0.420033|S|36.947286|E|display=inline}}).<ref name="euroscout">{{cite web |url = http://www.euro.scout.org/wsrc/fs/bp_e.shtml | title = "B-P" <U+2013> Chief scout of the world | work = Baden-Powell | publisher = World Organization of the Scout Movement | accessdate = 2006-11-16}}</ref> His gravestone bears a circle with a dot in the centre, which is the trail sign for "Going Home", or "I have gone home": [[Image:Signe-de-piste_fin-de-piste.jpg|20px|I have gone home]] When his wife Olave died, her ashes were sent to Kenya and interred beside her husband.

The Baden-Powells had three children &mdash; one son and two daughters, who all gained the courtesy title of [[The Honourable|Honourable]] in 1929. The son succeeded his father in 1941 to the titles of Baronet Baden-Powell and [[Baron Baden-Powell]].<ref name="burke">{{cite book | editor = Charles Mosley (editor) | title = Burke's Peerage and Baronetage | edition = 106th edition | publisher = Burke Peerage Genealogical Books Ltd | location = Crans, Switzerland | year = 1999}}</ref>

On his return from Africa in 1903, Baden-Powell found that his military training manual, ''Aids to Scouting'', had become a best-seller, and was being used by teachers and youth organisations.<ref name="best-seller">{{cite web | last = Peterson | first = Robert | year = 2003 | url = http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0310/d-wwas.html | title = Marching to a Different Drummer | work = Scouting Magazine | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 2007-01-02}}</ref> Following his involvement in the [[Boys' Brigade]] as Brigade Secretary and Officer in charge of its scouting section, with encouragement from his friend, [[William Alexander Smith (Boys' Brigade)|William Alexander Smith]], Baden-Powell decided to re-write ''Aids to Scouting'' to suit a youth readership. In 1907 he held a [[Brownsea Island Scout camp|camp on Brownsea Island]] for twenty-two boys of mixed social background to test out the applicability of his ideas. Baden-Powell was also influenced by [[Ernest Thompson Seton]], who founded the [[Woodcraft Indians]]. Seton gave Baden-Powell a copy of his book ''The Birch Bark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians'' and they met in 1906.<ref name="SetonWoo">{{cite web | last = Woo | first = Randy | year = Aug 1996 | url = http://members.aol.com/randywoo/bsahis/seton.htm | title = Ernest Thompson Seton | work = The Ultimate Boy Scouts of America History Site | publisher = Randy Woo | accessdate = 2006-12-07}}</ref><ref name="SetonInfed>{{cite web | year = 2002 | url = http://www.infed.org/thinkers/seton.htm | title = Ernest Thompson Seton and Woodcraft | publisher = InFed | accessdate = 2006-12-07}}</ref><ref name="BPInfed>{{cite web | year = 2002 | url = http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-bp.htm | title = Robert Baden-Powell as and Educational Innovator | publisher = InFed | accessdate = 2006-12-07}}</ref> ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'' was subsequently published in six instalments in 1908. 

Boys and girls spontaneously formed [[Troop|Scout troops]] and the [[Scouting]] movement had inadvertently started, first a national, and soon an international obsession. The Scouting movement was to grow up in friendly parallel relations with the Boys' Brigade. A rally for all Scouts was held at [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] in London in 1909, at which Baden-Powell discovered the first [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout|Girl Scouts]]. The [[Scouting|Girl Guides]] movement was subsequently founded in 1910 under the auspices of Baden-Powell's sister, Agnes Baden-Powell. Baden-Powell' friend, [[Juliette Gordon Low]], was encouraged by him to bring the movement to America, where she founded the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]].

In 1920, the [[1st World Scout Jamboree]] took place in [[Olympia, London|Olympia]], and Baden-Powell was acclaimed [[Chief Scout (United Kingdom)|Chief Scout]] of the World. Baden-Powell was made a hereditary [[Baronet]] in 1921, using his first name as Sir Robert, and was created ''Baron Baden-Powell, of Gilwell, Co. Essex'', on [[1929-09-17]], [[Gilwell Park]] being the International Scout Leader training centre.<ref name="ThePeerage">{{cite web |url = http://www.thepeerage.com/p876.htm#i8753 |title = Family history, Person Page 876 |publisher= The Peerage |accessdate= 2007-01-01}}</ref><ref name="Burke"> {{cite web | title = Burke's Peerage & Gentry | url = http://www.burkes-peerage.net/sites/Contents/book/UK/FHP/Peerage/fhp-BADENPOWELL.asp?&string1=badenpowell&BookType=Peerage&Region=UK#hit-1 | accessdate = 2007-01-01}}</ref> After receiving this honour, Baden-Powell mostly styled himself ''Baden-Powell of Gilwell''.

In 1929, during the [[3rd World Scout Jamboree]], he received as a present a new [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] car. This was soon nicknamed [[Swiss roll|Jam-Roll]]. He also received an [[Eccles]] [[travel trailer|Caravan]], which was nicknamed [[Eccles Cake]], so the Scouts attending the event were treated to the sight of a Jam-Roll towing an Eccles Cake. This combination well served the Baden-Powells in their further travels around [[Europe]]. Baden-Powell also had a positive impact on improvements in youth education.<ref name="education"> {{cite web | url = http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-bp.htm | work = Infed Thinkers | title = Baden-Powell as an Educational Innovator | accessdate = 2006-02-04}}</ref> Under his dedicated command the world Scouting movement grew. By 1922 there were more than a million Scouts in 32 countries; by 1939 the number of Scouts was in excess of 3.3&nbsp;million.<ref name='nagy'>{{cite book | first = L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3> | last = Nagy | authorlink = L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3> Nagy (Scouting) | title = 250 Million Scouts | publisher = [[World Scout Foundation]] | location = Geneva | year = 1985}}</ref>

At the [[5th World Scout Jamboree]] in 1937, Baden-Powell gave his farewell to scouting, and retired from public Scouting life. [[February 22]], the joint birthday of Robert and Olave Baden-Powell, continues to be marked as [[World Thinking Day|Founder's Day]] by Scouts and [[Thinking Day]] by Guides to remember and celebrate the work of the Chief Scout and Chief Guide of the World.

Baden-Powell made paintings and drawings, almost every day of his life.

There is, however, no evidence of his ever engaging in sexual activity with any males. He was adamant against Scoutmasters engaging in sexual contact with their charges, recommending [[flogging]] for transgressors. Baden-Powell believed strongly in the harmful effects of masturbation &mdash; a view not shared by all [[Victorian morality|educators of his time]] &mdash; and counseled Scouts to restrain the sexual impulse as far as possible. An exhortation against masturbation, written by Baden-Powell for inclusion in an early Scouting manual, was so graphic that his printer refused to print it unedited.<ref name="jeal"/>

In 1937 Baden-Powell was appointed to the [[Order of Merit]], one of the most exclusive awards in the [[British honours system]], and he was also awarded 28 decorations by foreign states.

The [[Bronze Wolf]], the only distinction of the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]], awarded by the [[World Scout Committee]] for exceptional services to world Scouting, was first awarded to Baden-Powell by a unanimous decision of the then ''International Committee'' on the day of the institution of the Bronze Wolf in [[Stockholm]] in 1935. He was also the first recipient of the [[Silver Buffalo Award]] in 1926, the highest award conferred by the [[Boy Scouts of America]].

In 1931, Major [[Frederick Russell Burnham]] dedicated [[Mount Baden-Powell (California)|Mount Baden-Powell]]<ref name="mtbp">{{cite web|url=http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnis/web_query.GetDetail?tab=Y&id=255344 Mount Baden-Powell|work=USGS|title=Mapping Service|accessdate=2006-04-17}}</ref> ({{coord|34|22|31|N|117|45|49|W|display=inline}}) in [[California]] to his old Scouting friend from forty years before.<ref name="dedication">{{cite web|url=http://www.pinetreeweb.com/dedication.htm |work=The Pine Tree Web|title=Dedication of Mount Baden-Powell|accessdate=April 23|accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="chances">{{cite book | last =Burnham | first =Frederick Russell | authorlink =Frederick Russell Burnham | coauthors = | title =Taking Chances | publisher =Haynes Corp | date =1944 | location = | pages = xxv-xxix | url = | doi = | id = ISBN 1-879356-32-5 }}</ref> Today their friendship is honoured in perpetuity with the dedication of the adjoining peak, [[Mount Burnham]] ({{coord|34|22|N|117|47|W|dispaly=title}}).<ref name="mtburnham">{{cite web|url=http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnis/web_query.GetDetail?tab=Y&id=255383 Mount Burnham|work=USGS|title=Mapping Service|accessdate=2006-04-17}}</ref>

Baden-Powell was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for the year 1939, but the Norwegian Nobel Committee decided not to award any prize for that year due to the start of [[World War II]].
