'''''Fritz the Cat''''' is a 1972 [[animated film]] written and directed by [[Ralph Bakshi]]. Based on the [[comic book]]s by [[Robert Crumb]], the film was the first animated feature film to receive an [[X-rated|X rating]] in the United States.<ref name="Maltin">{{cite book | title = Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons | first = Leonard | last = Maltin | year = 1987 | publisher = Plume | location = | id = ISBN 0-978-0452259935}}</ref><ref name="Funnyworld">{{cite web |url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Funnyworld/FritzPartOne/FritzOne.htm |title=The Filming of <i>Fritz the Cat</i>, Part One |accessdate=2007-03-02 |author=[[Michael Barrier|Barrier, Michael]] |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=Spring 1972 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=<i>Funnyworld</i>, No. 14 |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> It focuses on Fritz, a hypocritical [[anthropomorphic]] feline in the mid-1960s who seduces many female animals in [[New York City]] while staying one step ahead of the law.

The film had a troubled production history and controversial release. Creator Robert Crumb is known to have had disagreements with the filmmakers, claiming in interviews that his first wife had signed over the film rights to the characters, and that he did not approve the production.<ref name="Funnyworld-Crumb">{{cite web |url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Funnyworld/FritzPartTwo/Crumb.htm |title=The Filming of <i>Fritz the Cat</i>: Feedback from R.

==Plot==
{{spoiler}}
The film begins with three [[construction]] workers on their [[Lunch|lunch break]]. They complain that they spend so much money to send their children to college, only to instead find out that the kids instead spend all of their time drinking [[Alcoholic beverage|booze]], smoking [[marijuana]], and having [[sex]] with each other. One construction worker gets up to [[urinate]] off of the scaffold, the [[urine]] landing on the head of a [[hippie]] with a [[guitar]]. In a [[New York City]] park, various hippies are gathered with guitars to sing [[protest song]]s. Fritz and his buddies show up in an attempt to meet girls. When a trio of attractive females walk by, they exhaust themselves trying to get their attention, but find that they're more interested in the [[crow]] standing a few feet away. The girls attempt to flirt with the crow, making some condescending remarks about [[black (people)|black]]s, while Fritz looks on in annoyance. Suddenly, the crow rebukes the girls with a snide remark and walks away. Fritz silently laughs at the stunned girls. After a beat, Fritz catches the girls' attention by lamenting: 

<blockquote>"My soul is tormented! I've been up and down the four corners of this big old world! I've seen it all! I've done it all! I've fought many a good man, and laid many a good woman! I've had riches and fame and adventure...I've tasted life to the fullest, and still my heart cries out, yes, cries out in this hungry, tortured, wrecked quest: 'More!'"</blockquote>
[[Image:Naked Closeness.jpg|left|thumb|240px|Fritz and three girls "seek the truth."]]
Fritz invites one the girls to his "pad" so they can "seek the truth." When the others complain, "what about my soul, you fink?" Fritz silently comments "Hmm, four in a bed. That's a kick I haven't tried yet." He brings all three of them up to a friend's apartment where a wild party is taking place. Fritz drags the girls into the bathroom and the four of them have [[group sex]] in the tub. Meanwhile, two incredibly dimwitted [[pig]] [[police|officers]] show up to raid the place. As the pigs walk up the stairs, one of the partygoers finds Fritz and the girls in the bath tub. Several others show up and jump in, pushing Fritz to the side where he takes solace in [[marijuana]]. The two officers break into the apartment, but find that it's empty, as everyone has moved into the bathroom. As one of the pigs busts into the bathroom and begins to beat up the various hippies, Fritz takes refuge in the toilet. As the pig becomes exhausted, a very stoned Fritz jumps out grabs the pig's gun, and shoots out the toilet, breaking the water main, flooding everybody out of the apartment. The pigs chase Fritz all the way down the street into a [[synagogue]]. Fritz manages to get out when the various Jews get up to celebrate the United States' decision to send more weapons into [[Israel]].
[[Image:Fritz Duke cop.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Fritz and Duke have a run in with the law after stealing a car.]]
Fritz makes it back to his [[Dormitory|dorm]], where his [[roommates]] ignore him. He winds up setting all of his notes and books on [[fire]]. When he tries to put the fire out with a blanket, the blanket catches on fire. The fire spreads throughout the dorm, finally setting the entire building ablaze. On the run from the law, Fritz finds himself in a bar in Harlem. He meets Duke the crow at a [[Pocket billiards|billiard]] table. After narrowly avoiding getting into a fight with the bartender, Duke invites Fritz to "bug out." The other crows in the bar laugh at Fritz's apparent non-understanding of what the phrase means. When Duke begins to steal a car, Fritz is eager to join in on performing an illegal activity. Fritz winds up driving it off a bridge. Before the [[Car accident|car crashes]] into the waters and rocks below, Duke winds up saving Fritz's life. The two arrive at an apartment owned by Bertha, a former prostitute-turned [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealer]]. When Fritz arrives, she shoves several joints into his mouth. His use of marijuana increases his [[Libido|sex drive]], and so he rushes off into an alley to have sex with Bertha the crow. While having sex with her, he comes to a supreme realization that he "must tell the people about the revolution!" He runs off into the city street and incites a riot, during which Duke is shot and killed, and winds up being chased by several cops. 

He hides in an alley where his girlfriend, Winston Schwartz, shows up to find him. She drags him out on a road trip to [[San Francisco]], stopping at a [[Howard Johnson's]] restaurant along the way, and disenchanting Fritz with her refusal to go to unusual places. The car runs out of gas in the middle of the desert, and Fritz decides to abandon her. Fritz meets up with Blue, a [[heroin]]-addicted [[Neo-Nazi]] biker. Along with the biker's horse girlfriend, Harriet, they take a ride to an underground hide-out where several other revolutionaries tell Fritz of their plan to blow up a [[Power station|power plant]]. When Harriet tries to get Blue to leave, he hits her several times, and ties her down with a chain. When Fritz objects to their treatment of her, he is hit in the face with a candle. The group throws Harriet on the bed, and [[rape]]s her. In the next scene, Harriet is sitting in a graveyard, naked and traumatized. Fritz puts a coat over her and gets into a car. He and the lizard drive out to the power plant. After planting the dynamite, Fritz suddenly has a change of heart. The lizard sets the fuse on fire and drives off as Fritz tries to get the dynamite out of its tight spot and fails. The dynamite explodes, blowing up both the power plant and Fritz. At a [[Los Angeles]] hospital, Harriet and the girls that Fritz picked up in the park earlier in the film show up to comfort him. Fritz speaks what appear to be his final words before suddenly regaining his strength. Fritz grabs each of the three girls and throws them onto the bed, once again having sex with each of them as Harriet watches in surprise.

==Background==
[[Image:202b.JPG.JPG|right|thumb|Ralph Bakshi at Sammy's Bowery Follies during a location scout for the film.]]
Producer [[Steve Krantz]] saw potential in [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s vision for animated films specifically for adults. Having sold Krantz the production and distribution for what was to become the 1973 Bakshi feature, ''[[Heavy Traffic]],'' Krantz told Bakshi to make a film adapted from another author's work before moving on to his original work. Bakshi agreed, and the two searched for the perfect project. In 1969, Krantz discovered a large [[Paperback|paperback book]] containing three stories featuring [[Robert Crumb]]'s [[anthropomorphic]] 1960s comic book character [[Fritz the Cat]], whom Crumb partially based on himself.<ref name="Funnyworld"/>

Later that year, Krantz and Bakshi got in touch with Crumb and paid his way from his home north of San Francisco to New York, in order to talk with him about getting the film rights to the characters. After several meetings, Krantz received a contract, signed by Crumb, in the mail, and that in return Crumb received twelve thousand five hundred dollars, which was supplemented by a percentage of the film's gross proceeds.<ref name="Funnyworld"/> However, Crumb claims that Krantz and Bakshi approached his first wife, Dana, about purchasing the film rights to the characters, and she signed away the film rights against Crumb's wishes.<ref name="Funnyworld-Crumb"/><ref name="Crumbhandbook"/>

==Distribution and funding==
With the rights to the character, Krantz and Bakshi set out to find a distributor. "When I say that every major distributor turned it down, this is not an exaggeration,"<ref name="Funnyworld"/> remembers Krantz. In the spring, [[Warner Bros.]] agreed to distribute the film and to provide money for making the picture.<ref name="Funnyworld"/> Late in November, Bakshi and Krantz had made a presentation reel containing a few minutes of finished animation, pencil tests, and shots of some of Bakshi's storyboards made to show to the studio, who wanted film stars' voices for the characters and also wanted Bakshi to tone down the material, removing the explicit sex in a scene with Fritz and Bertha. Bakshi and Krantz left, taking their project with them.<ref name="Funnyworld"/> The distribution and financing problems were cleared up late in 1970, when Cinemation Industries attached themselves to the project and [[Fantasy Records]] agreed to help fund the film.<ref name="Funnyworld"/>

==Production==
The film's voice cast includes [[Skip Hinnant]], Rosetta LeNoire, John McCurry and Phil Seuling. Hinnant was previously known as a featured performer on ''[[The Electric Company]]''. Bakshi himself appeared in a cameo as one of the film's comically inept [[pig]] officers,<ref name="Funnyworld-2">{{cite web |url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Funnyworld/FritzPartTwo/FritzFour.htm |title=The Filming of <i>Fritz the Cat</i>, Part Two |accessdate=2007-03-02 |author=[[Michael Barrier|Barrier, Michael]] |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=Fall 1973 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=<i>Funnyworld</i>, No. 15 |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> using a voice he later recreated for the part of a storm trooper in his 1977 animated [[science fiction]] film ''[[Wizards (film)|Wizards]]''.<ref name="WizardsCommentary">Bakshi, Ralph. ''Wizards'' [[DVD]], 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, 2004, [[audio commentary]].  ASIN: B0001NBMIK</ref> Almost all of the film's dialogue was recorded entirely on the streets of [[New York City]], except for a few of the main characters.<ref name="Bio">{{cite web |url=http://www.ralphbakshi.com/bio.php |title=Biography |accessdate=2007-01-23 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Ralph Bakshi.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

===Writing===
The original screenplay consisted mostly of dialog, and featured only a few changes from Crumb's stories. However, it went largely unused in favor of more experimental storytelling techniques.<ref name="Funnyworld-2"/> Throughout the production, complete storyboards were never used. According to Bakshi, "I don't like to jump ahead on my films. The way you feel about a film on Day One, you may not feel the same way forty weeks down the road. Characters grow, so I wanted to have the option to change things, and strengthen my characters... It was sort of a stream of consciousness, and a learning process for myself."<ref name="Funnyworld-2"/> Some scenes used audio recordings made by Bakshi edited to fit the scene. For instance, the scene in the synagogue uses a recording of Bakshi's father and uncles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ralphbakshi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=10816#10816 |title=Bakshi Board Exclusive Interview #6 |accessdate=2007-03-02 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Ralph Bakshi Forum |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> For another scene, Bakshi went to a [[Harlem]] bar with a tape recorder and spent several hours talking to black patrons, getting drunk with them as he asked them questions.<ref name="Funnyworld-2"/>

The first part of the film's story was adapted from a self-titled story first published in a 1968 issue of ''R. Crumb's Head Comix'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Crumb |first=Robert |author= |coauthors= |title=Fritz the Cat |year=1968 |publisher=R. Crumb's Head Comix |location= |isbn= }}</ref><ref name="Funnyworld-2"/> while the second part is derived from "Fritz Bugs Out," first serialized in the February to October 1968 issues of ''Cavalier'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Crumb |first=Robert |author= |coauthors= |title=Fritz Bugs Out |year=February to October 1968 |publisher=Cavalier |location= |isbn= }}</ref><ref name="Funnyworld-2"/> and the final part of the story contains elements of "Fritz the No-Good," first published in the September/October 1968 issue of ''Cavalier''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Crumb |first=Robert |author= |coauthors= |title=Fritz the No-Good |year=September/October 1968 |publisher=Cavalier |location= |isbn= }}</ref> The last half of the film makes a major departure from Crumb's work. [[Michael Barrier]] describes this section of the film as being "much grimmer than Crumb's stories past that point, and far more violent."<ref name="Funnyworld-2"/>

In the film, there are two characters named "Winston" &ndash; one of which appears at the beginning of the film, and again at the end of the film, the other being Winston Schwartz. Some viewers, including Michael Barrier, note that the Winston Schwartz character, who appears prominently in "Fritz Bugs Out" and "Fritz the No-Good," never has a proper introduction in Bakshi's film, and interpreted the naming of a separate character as being an attempt by Bakshi to reconcile this, although the two characters look and sound nothing alike.<ref name="Funnyworld-2"/> However, Bakshi has explained on his official website that when he started storyboarding the film, "I got a little bit confused and started storyboarding that Winston as a hippy chick in the village. Then I started storyboarding that Winston for the later part of the film. When I screened the rushes later, I caught it, but figured there are lots of Winstons in one's life."<ref name="Winston">{{cite web |url=http://www.wild-things.com/bray/documents/ralphb.doc |title=Questions for Ralph Bakshi |accessdate=2007-03-04 |author=Bakshi, Ralph |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Ralph Bakshi Forum |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

===Animation===
[[Image:In the Park With Fritz.jpg|right|thumb|220px|"Sheesh, what a mob in the park today."]]
Much of the backgrounds were created by tracing from photographs taken by animator Johnnie Vita. Despite the film's publicity, however, not every background was taken from live-action sources.<ref name="Funnyworld-2"/> Animator Ira Turek drew the backgrounds with a [[Rapidograph]] pen<U+2014>the technical pen preferred by Robert Crumb. This was done in an attempt to capture much of Crumb's style in his background drawings.<ref name="Funnyworld-2"/> After Turek had completed a background drawing in ink on an animation cel, the drawing would be Xeroxed onto watercolor paper for Vita, and onto animation paper for the animators to use in matching the characters to the backgrounds. When Vita had finished his painting, Turek's original drawing, on the cel, would be placed over the watercolor, obscuring the Xerox lines on the painting.<ref name="Funnyworld-2"/>

===Music===
{{main|Fritz the Cat (soundtrack)}}
The film's score was performed by [[Ed Bogas]] and [[Ray Shanklin]]. The film also featured songs by [[Cal Tjader]], [[Bo Diddley]] and [[Billie Holiday]]. According to Bakshi, he bought the rights to use Holiday's performance of the song "Yesterdays" for $35.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fulvuedrive-in.com/interview/1032/RALPH+BAKSHI+INTERVIEW |title=Ralph Bakshi on the recent DVD release of ''Wizards'' |accessdate=2007-03-06 |author=Simmons, Stephanie |authorlink= |coauthors=Simmons, Areya |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Fulvue Drive-In |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> A [[Fritz the Cat (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] was released on [[Fantasy Records]] in 1972.

==Publicity==
The film received an [[X-rated|X rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]].<ref name="Maltin"/><ref name="Funnyworld"/> The film's distributor capitalized on the rating in the film's advertising material, which touted the film as being "X rated and animated!" According to Ralph Bakshi, "We almost didn't deliver the picture, because of the exploitation of it."<ref name="Funnyworld"/> Before the film's release, American distributors attempted to cash in on the publicity garnered from ''Fritz the Cat'' receiving an X rating from the MPAA by rushing out dubbed versions of two [[adult animation]]s from [[Japan]], applying an X rating to the advertising material: ''Senya ichiya monogatari'' and ''Kureopatora'', retitled ''[[One Thousand and One Arabian Nights (film)|One Thousand and One Arabian Nights]]'' and ''[[Cleopatra: Queen of Sex]]''. However, neither film had been actually submitted to the MPAA, and it is believed that neither feature would have received an X rating if they had been.<ref name="Funnyworld"/>

==Response==
[[Image:Fritz the Cat promo.jpg|right|thumb|Promo for the ''Fritz the Cat'' [[Fritz the Cat (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] showing the film as the second-highest grossing film in the week of June 7, 1972, behind ''[[The Godfather]]''.]]

Critical reaction to the film was positive. Film website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], which compiles reviews from a wide range of critics, gives the film a score of 67%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fritz_the_cat/ |title=Fritz the Cat |accessdate=2007-03-02 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> The film was also a box office success, and the first independent animated film to gross more than $100 million at the box office.<ref name="Variety"/> The film, however, did not go without its share of controversy. 

===Crumb's response===
Robert Crumb first saw the film in February 1972, during a visit to [[Los Angeles]] in the company of other underground cartoonists, and disliked the film. Crumb is quoted as saying:

<blockquote>"I told all of those guys, say, you know, we can see that ''Fritz the Cat'' movie while we're down here<U+2014>[[Spain Rodriguez|Spain]] and [[S. Clay Wilson|Wilson]] and [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]] and [[Rick Griffin|Griffin]], they were all there, at Williams' house. So I called up Bakshi and said, hey, I'm down here and I'd like to see the movie, and all the other guys are here, too. He said, okay, I'll call you and let you know tomorrow when you can see it. He called me the next morning and said he just wanted me to see it, he really didn't want those guys there. He was sure they'd hate it and put 'im down real bad, and he just wanted me to see it with him so that he could talk to me about it alone, and he'd feel better if just I came down by myself<U+2014>he was so insistent about it. I said, well, okay, and then I hung up and I told the guys what he said. They were real pissed off and disappointed, they wanted to see it. [...] I went out and said, listen, you've gotta let those guys come, because they're really countin' on seein' it, you know, you can't tell them they can't see it. [...] So they all get in their cars, and I get in Ralph Bakshi's sports car with him, and we take off, and Bakshi tries to ditch these guys, and he can't do it. [...]  [The film is] weird: it's really a reflection of Ralph Bakshi's confusion, you know. There's something real repressed about it. In a way, it's more twisted than my stuff. It's really twisted in some kind of weird, unfunny way. [...] I didn't like that sex attitude in it very much. It's like real repressed horniness; he's kind of letting it out compulsively."<ref name="Funnyworld-2"/></blockquote>

Crumb also took issue with the film's condemnation of the radical [[left-wing|left]].<ref name="Funnyworld"/> Reportedly, Crumb filed suit to have his name removed from the film's credits. San Francisco copyright attorney Albert L. Morse claims that no suit was filed, but an agreement was reached to remove Crumb's name from the credits.<ref name="Funnyworld-Crumb"/> However, as Crumb's name has remained in the final film since its original theatrical release, these claims are highly unlikely. Crumb later drew a comic in which the character was killed off,<ref>{{cite book |last=Crumb |first=Robert |author= |coauthors= |title=Fritz the Cat "Superstar" |year=1972 |publisher=The People's Comics |location= |isbn= }}</ref><ref name="Funnyworld-Crumb"/> and claimed that he "wrote them a letter telling them not to use any more of my characters in their films."<ref name="Funnyworld"/> Crumb later said of the film:

<blockquote>"I barely remember the movie. It's one of those experiences I sort of block out. The last time I saw it was when I was making an appearance at a [[Germany|German]] art school in the mid-1980s, and I was forced to watch it with the students. It was an excruciating ordeal, a humiliating embarrassment. I recall [[Victor Moscoso]] was the only one who warned me, 'if you don't stop this film from being made, you are going to regret it for the rest of your life'<U+2014>and he was right."<ref name="Crumbhandbook"/></blockquote>

Of Crumb, Bakshi said:

<blockquote>"R. Crumb is a funny guy. We<U+2019>ve spoken over the years and he was always nice to me on the phone and I<U+2019>m always nice to him. I love R. Crumb, but when he does an interview he can<U+2019>t help taking a dig at me. If you notice he takes a dig at everybody his mother, his father, his brother, his sister. In other words, I don<U+2019>t take it seriously. That<U+2019>s what R. Crumb s all about. He<U+2019>s always pointing a finger. He did [[Crumb (film)|a movie]] that I thought that was more embarrassing to him than my ''Fritz the Cat'' was to him. I think that taught him a lesson. He took a camera to his house and shot his poor brothers and his dysfunctional family."<ref name="Newsarama">{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?threadid=46252 |title=Interview with Ralph Bakshi |accessdate=2007-03-02 |author=Epstein, Daniel Robert |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=October 13, 2005 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref></blockquote>

===Controversy===
Meanwhile, the film sparked some negative reactions from viewers who were turned off by the film's content. Bakshi remembers, "A lot of top animators in the business took a full page ad out in [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] telling me to take my garbage back east. It was 'We of the [[Walt Disney|Disney]] tradition resent you coming here.' This really hurt and confused me &ndash; I couldn't understand other artists telling any artists what you should or should not do. I remember not wanting to leave my office because I felt the guys animating for me felt the same way. But Irv Spence &ndash; great [[Metro-Goldwyn Mayer|MGM]] [[Tom & Jerry (MGM)|Tom & Jerry]] animator &ndash; walked in my office at the end of the day and told me what I was doing was absolutely on the money, and he was having the best time of his life. Irv was as great as anyone on that Variety ad. From that moment on it became us against them. Irv was about 30 years my senior."<ref name="VarietyFritz">{{cite web |url=http://www.ralphbakshi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3832#3832 |title=biography |accessdate=2007-03-02 |author=Bakshi, Ralph |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Ralph Bakshi Forum |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> 

"A lot of people got freaked out," says Bakshi. "The people in charge of the power structure, the people in charge of magazines and the people going to work in the morning who loved Disney and [[Norman Rockwell]], thought I was a pornographer, and they made things very difficult for me. The younger people, the people who could take new ideas, were the people I was addressing. I wasn't addressing the whole world. To those people who loved it, it was a huge hit, and everyone else wanted to kill me."<ref name="Guardian">{{cite web |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,1841791,00.html |title=Who flamed Roger Rabbit? |accessdate=2007-03-02 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=August 11, 2006 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>
