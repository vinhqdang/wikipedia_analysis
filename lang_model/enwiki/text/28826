'''USS ''Illinois'' (BB-65)''' was to be the fifth {{sclass|Iowa|battleship}} constructed for the [[United States Navy]]; she was the fourth ship to be [[ship naming and launching|named]] in honor of [[Illinois|the 21st state]]. Among the {{sclass|Iowa|battleship}}s, ''Illinois'' is notable for being one of the two uncompleted battleships, and for being the only member of the class not considered for a rebuild of any kind.

Hull BB-65 was originally to be the first ship of the {{sclass|Montana|battleship}}s, but changes during the [[Second World War]] resulted in her being reordered as an {{sclass|Iowa|battleship}} midway through the war. Adherance to the ''Iowa''-class layout rather than the ''Montana''-class layout allowed BB-65 to gain eight knots in speed, carry more 20&nbsp;mm and 40&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft guns, and transit the locks of the [[Panama Canal]]; however, the move away from the ''Montana''-class layout left BB-65 with a reduction in the heavier armaments and without the additional armor and that were to have been added to BB-65 during her time on the drawing board as USS ''Montana''. 

Like her sister ship {{USS|Kentucky|BB-66}}, ''Illinois'' was still under construction at the end of World War II. Her construction was canceled in August 1945, but her hull remained until 1958 when it was broken up. 

==Design==
{{main|Montana class battleship|Iowa class battleship}}
The passage of the [[Second Vison Act]] in 1939 had cleared the way for construction of the four [[South Dakota class battleship (1939)|''South Dakota''-class]] [[fast battleship]]s and the first two ''Iowa'' class battleships (those with the hull numbers BB-61 and BB-62).<ref name="math">{{cite web |url=http://web.umr.edu/~rogersda/american&military_history/World%27s%20Fastest%20Battleships.pdf |title=Development of the World's Fastest Battleships |accessdate=2007-04-28 |format=pdf |last=Rogers |first=J. David}}</ref> The latter four battleships of the class, those designated with the hull numbers BB-63, BB-64, BB-65, and BB-66 were not cleared for construction until 1940,<ref name="math"/> and at the time BB-65 and BB-66 were intended to be the first ships of the ''Montana''-class.<ref>http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/bb-67.htm</ref> 

Originally, BB-65 was to be the United States Navy's counter to the [[Empire of Japan]]'s {{sclass|Yamato|battleship}}s, whose construction at the time was known to the highest ranking members of the United States Navy. ''Yamato'' and ''Mushai'' were rumored to have guns of up to {{in to mm|num=18|abbr=yes|spell=Commonwealth|precision=2|wiki=yes}}. To combat this the United States Navy began designing a 58,000 ton ship with an intended armament of twelve {{in to mm|num=16|abbr=yes|spell=commonwealth|precision=2|wiki=yes}}. This battleship took shape in the mid-1930s as USS ''Montana'', the lead ship of her class of [[dreadnought]] battleships. She would have fielded three more {{in to mm|num=16|abbr=yes|spell=Commonwealth|precision=2|wiki=yes}} guns than those mounted aboard the ''Iowa''-class, a more powerful secondary battery of [[5"/54 caliber Mark 45 gun|5&nbsp;in (127&nbsp;mm)/54&nbsp;caliber DP mounts]],<ref name="navwep2">{{cite web

The increase in ''Montana<U+2019>s'' firepower and armor came at the expense of her speed and her [[Panamax]] capabilities, but the latter issue was to be resolved through the construction of a third, much wider set of locks at the [[Panama Canal]]. As the situation in Europe deteriorated in the late-[[1930s]], the USA began to be concerned once more about its ability to move warships between the oceans. The largest U.S. battleships were already so large as to have problems with the canal locks; and there were concerns about the locks being put out of action by enemy bombing. In 1939, to address these concerns, construction began on a new set of locks for the canal that could carry the larger warships which the U.S. had either under construction or planned for future construction.<ref>The work proceeded for several years, and significant excavation was carried out on the new approach channels; but the project was canceled after [[World War II]].

By 1942 the United States Navy shifted its building focus from battleships to [[aircraft carrier]]s after the successes of carrier combat in both the [[Battle of Coral Sea]], and to a greater extent, the [[Battle of Midway]].<ref name="spring">Naval Historical Center.

As a result the construction of the U.S. fleet of {{sclass|Essex|aircraft carrier}}s had been given the highest priority for completion in the U.S. [[shipyard]]s by the U.S. Navy.<ref name="magazine"/> The ''Essex''-class carriers were proving vital to the war effort by enabling the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] to gain and maintain [[air supremacy]] in the [[Pacific Theatre of World War II]], and were rapidly becoming the principle striking arm of the United States Navy in the ongoing effort to defeat the [[Empire of Japan]].<ref name="discovery">{{cite episode | title = The 10 Greatest Fighting Ships in Military History | network = The Discovery Channel}}Web page: [http://military.discovery.com/convergence/topten/warships/slideshow/slideshow_10.html Top Ten Fighting Ships] Retrieved [[23 April]] [[2007]].</ref> Accordingly, the United States accepted shortcomings in the armor for their {{sclass|North Carolina|battleship}}s, [[South Dakota class battleship (1939)|''South Dakota''-class battleships]], and {{sclass|Iowa|battleship}}s in favor of their additional speed, which enabled these battleship classes to steam at a comparable speed with the ''Essex''-class and provide the carriers with the maximum amount of anti-aircraft protection.<ref name="discovery"/>

==Development==
When BB-65 was redesignated an {{sclass|Iowa|battleship}}, she was assigned the name ''Illinois'' and reconfigured to adhere to the "[[fast battleship]]" designs planned in 1938 by the Preliminary Design Branch at the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]].<ref name="The Battleships II">{{cite book | last =Johnston, Ian & McAuley, Rob | title =The Battleships | publisher =Channel 4 Books (an imprint of Pan Macmillian, LTD) | date =2002 | location =London | pages =pages 108&ndash;123 | url = http://www.panmacmillan.com/ | id =ISBN 0752261886}}</ref><ref> This was not the first time that changes to the ''Iowa'' class had been proposed: at the time the battleships were cleared for construction some policymakers were not sold on the U.S. need for more battleships, and proposed turning the ''Iowa''-class ships into aircraft carriers by retaining the hull design, but switching their decks to carry and handle aircraft (This had already been done on the battlecruisers {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|2}} and {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}}). The proposal was countered by [[Admiral]] [[Ernest King]], the Chief of Naval Operations. {{cite web | title =BB-61 Iowa-class Aviation Conversion | url =http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/bb-61-av.htm | accessdate =2007-05-19}}</ref> Her funding was authorized via the passage of the Two Ocean Navy bill through the United States Congress in 1940,<ref>This bill was passed after the German invasion of France, which prompted President Franklin D.

In adherence with the ''Iowa''-class design, ''Illinois'' would have a maximum beam of 108 ft (32.9 m) and a waterline length of 860&nbsp;ft (262&nbsp;m), permitting a maximum speed of {{convert|34.9|knot|km/h|1}}. The Navy also called for the class to have a lengthened [[forecastle]], amid-ship, and a [[bulbous bow]], which would increase her speed to 35&nbsp;knots.<ref name="math"/>

Like ''Kentucky'', ''Illinois'' differed from her earlier sisters in that her design called for an all-welded construction, which would have saved weight and increased strength over a combination riveted/welded hull used on the four completed ''Iowa''-class ships. Engineers considered retaining the original {{sclass|Montana|battleship|0}} armor for added [[torpedo]] and [[naval mine]] protection because the newer scheme would have improved ''Illinois''<U+2019> armor protection by as much as 20%.<ref name="armor">{{cite web |url=http://www.battleship.org/html/Articles/IowaClass/Armor.htm |title=Iowa Class: Armor Protection |accessdate=2007-12-22}}</ref> This was rejected due to time constraints and ''Illinois'' was built with an ''Iowa''-class hull design.<ref name="math">{{cite web |url=http://web.umr.edu/~rogersda/american&military_history/World%27s%20Fastest%20Battleships.pdf |title=Development of the World's Fastest Battleships |accessdate=2007-04-28 |format=pdf |last=Rogers |first=J.
