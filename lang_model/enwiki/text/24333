The '''Caspian expeditions of the Rus''' were military raids undertaken by [[Rus' (people)|the Rus]]  between [[864]] and [[1041]] on the [[Caspian Sea]] shores.<ref name="Logan201">Logan (1992), p. 201</ref> Initially, the Rus appeared in [[Saerkland]] in the 9th century traveling as merchants along the [[Volga trade route]], selling furs, honey, and slaves. The first small-scale raids took place in the late 9th and early 10th century. The Rus undertook the first large-scale expedition in 913; having arrived on 500 ships, they pillaged [[Gorgan]], the territory of present day [[Azerbaijan]], and the adjacent areas, taking slaves and goods. On their return, the northern raiders were attacked and defeated by [[Khazar]] [[Muslims]] in the [[Volga Delta]], and those who escaped were killed by the local tribes on the middle [[Volga]].

During their next expedition in 943, the Rus captured [[Barda, Azerbaijan|Barda]], the capital of [[Arran]], in the modern-day [[Azerbaijan]]. The Rus stayed there for several months, killing many inhabitants of the city and amassing substantial plunder. It was only an outbreak of [[dysentery]] among the Rus that forced them to depart with their spoils. [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav]], prince of [[Kiev]], commanded the next attack, which destroyed the [[Khazars|Khazar]] state in 965. Sviatoslav's campaign established the Rus's hold on the north-south trade routes, helping to alter the demographics of the region. Raids continued through the time period with the last Scandinavian attempt to reestablish the route to the Caspian Sea taking place in 1041 by [[Ingvar the Far-Travelled]].

==Background and early raids ==
[[Image:Varangian routes.png|thumb|left|250px|Map showing the major Varangian trade routes: the [[Volga trade route]] (in red) and the [[Trade Route from the Varangians to the Greeks]] (in purple). Other trade routes of the [[8th century|8th]]-[[11th century|11th centuries]] shown in orange.]]
The Rus first penetrated to the Muslim areas adjacent to the Caspian Sea as traders rather than warriors. By the early 9th century, the [[Norsemen]] settled in northwestern Russia, where they established a settlement called [[Aldeigja]] (Slavic: ''[[Ladoga]]'') about six miles (10km) south of the [[Volkhov River]] entry into [[Lake Ladoga]]. From there, they began trading with the [[Byzantine Empire]] along the [[Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks|Dnieper trade route]] and with the [[Muslim]] lands around the Caspian Sea along the [[Volga trade route]].<ref name="Brondsted">Br<U+00F8>ndsted (1965), pp. 64&ndash;65</ref> In the late 9th century, [[ibn Khordadbeh]] described the Rus buying goods from the Khazars in the market areas on the lower [[Volga River|Volga]] and selling them on the markets of Caspian towns;<ref name="Logan200">Logan (1992), p. 200</ref> these merchants brought furs, honey, and slaves.<ref name="Brondsted"/> Small groups of the Rus even went on camels as far as [[Baghdad]] to sell their goods; their [[Europe]]an slaves interpreted for them.<ref name="Logan200"/>

[[Thomas Schaub Noonan]] suggested that the Rus reached Baghdad as early as 800; this argument is supported by the finding of [[Sassanid]], [[Arab]], and Arabo-Sassanid [[dirham]] coins dated no later than 804-805 at [[Peterhof]], near [[Saint-Petersburg]].<ref>Noonan (1987-1991)</ref> In ibn Khordadbeh's account, the Rus are described as "a kind of the [[Saqaliba]]", a term usually used to refer to [[Slavs]], and anti-Normanist scholars have interpreted this passage as indicative of the Rus being Slavs rather than [[Scandinavians]]. In the interpretation of the Normanist scholars, the word ''Saqaliba'' was also frequently applied to all fair-haired, ruddy-complexioned populations of [[Central Europe|Central]], [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]], and [[Northeastern Europe]], so ibn Khordadbeh's language is ambiguous here.<ref name="Rus">"Rus". ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''</ref>

The first Caspian raid of the Rus occurred sometime in the reign of [[Hasan ibn Zaid]], ruler of [[Tabaristan]] between 864 and 884. The Rus sailed into the Caspian Sea and unsuccessfully attacked its eastern shore at [[Abaskun]].<ref>Abaskun, first recorded by [[Ptolemy]] as ''Socanaa'', was documented in Arab sources as "the most famous port of the Khazarian Sea". It was situated within three days' journey from [[Gorgan]]. The southern part of the Caspian Sea was known as the "Sea of Abaskun". See: B.N. Zakhoder (1898-1960). ''The Caspian Compilation of Records about Eastern Europe'' ([http://gumilevica.kulichki.net/Rest/index.html online version]).</ref> This raid was probably on a very small scale.<ref name="Logan201"/> The second raid took place in 909 or 910<ref>Information about the Rus raids comes largely from Muslim sources, which use the [[Islamic calendar]]. Because the years of the Islamic calendar do not map exactly to the years of the [[Gregorian calendar]], an event dated to a certain year of the Islamic calendar may have occurred in either of the two consecutive years of the Gregorian calendar.</ref> and was likewise aimed at Abaskun;<ref name="Rus">"Rus". ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''</ref> just like the previous attack, this expedition was a minor one with only sixteen ships participating in it.<ref name="Logan201"/> The third minor raid took place in 911 or 912.<ref name="Rus"/>

==Raid of 913 ==
[[Image:Rus Caspian.png|thumb|right|350px|Map showing the locations of major Rus' raids around the Caspian Sea, mid-[[9th century|9th]] to mid-[[11th century]]. Blue dates indicate major Rus' raids; purple outline indicates area affected by the 913 Caspian invasion. Names of polities shown depict the situation c. 950.]]
The Rus launched the first large-scale raid in [[913]]. A fleet of 500 ships reached the southern shores of the Caspian Sea through the country of the Khazars. In order to secure a peaceful passage through the land of the Khazars, the Rus  promised the Khazars half of their spoils. They sailed down the [[Dnieper River]] into the Black Sea, then into the [[Sea of Azov]], then up the [[Don River]] past the Khazar city of [[Sarkel]], and then by a [[portage]] reached the Volga, which led them into the Caspian Sea.<ref name="Logan201"/> 

The Rus attacked in the [[Gorgan]] region around Abaskun, pillaging the countryside as they went. An attempt to repel them as they lay in anchor near islands in the southwestern part of the Caspian Sea proved unsuccessful; and they were then able to roam and raid at will. Across the sea they raided at [[Baku]], penetrating inland a distance of three days<U+2019> journey,<ref name="Logan201"/> and plundering the regions of [[Arran (Azerbaijan)|Arran]], [[Beylagan]], and [[Shirvan]].<ref name="Rus"/> Everywhere they looted as much as they could, taking women and children as slaves. The news of their outrages preceded them as they headed homeward<ref name="Logan201"/> and, in the [[Volga Delta]], the Rus were attacked by Khazar Muslims, as well as by some Christians, apparently with the acquiescence of the Khazar ruler. According to [[al-Masudi]], those who escaped were finished off by the [[Burtas]] and [[Volga Bulgars]].<ref name="Rus"/>

==Raid of 943==
The second large-scale campaign is dated to [[943]], when [[Igor of Kiev|Igor]] was the supreme leader of the Rus, according to the [[Primary Chronicle]]. During the 943 expedition, the Rus rowed up the [[Kura River]], deep into the Caucasus, defeated the forces of [[Mazurban ibn Muhammad]],<ref>"Bardha'a". ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''</ref> and captured [[Barda, Azerbaijan|Barda]], the capital of Arran. The Rus allowed the local people to retain their religion in exchange for recognition of their overlordship; it is possible that the Rus intended to settle permanently there.<ref>Logan (1992), pp. 201&ndash;202; "Rus". ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''</ref><!--[[Ruslan Skrynnikov]] compares the strategy of the Rus, as described by Arabian sources, with the Viking-Varangian settlement in [[Gardariki]], Norman Sicily, and with Svyatoslav's attempt to carve out for himself a state in Bulgaria. In each case, they arrived as military elite and were soon assimilated by local population, whose culture they influenced only minimally. It is possible that, due to some disagreement with Igor, Sveneld aspired to create for himself a kingdom in the fertile south.--> According to [[ibn Miskawaih]], the local people broke the peace by stone-throwing and other abuse directed against the Rus, who then demanded that the inhabitants evacuate the city. This ultimatum was rejected, and the Rus began killing people and holding many for ransom. The slaughter was briefly interrupted for negotiations, which soon broke down.<ref>Logan (1992), pp. 201&ndash;202</ref> The Rus stayed in Barda for several months,<ref>According to [[Yaqut al-Hamawi|Yaqut]], they stayed for a whole year. "Bardha'a". ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''</ref> using it as a base for plundering the adjacent areas, and amassed substantial spoils.<ref name="Vernadsky69">Vernadsky (1959), p. 269</ref> 

The city was saved only by an outbreak of [[dysentery]] among the Rus.<ref name="Logan202">Logan (1992), p. 202</ref> Ibn Miskawaih writes that the Rus "indulged excessively in the fruit of which there are numerous sorts there. This produced an epidemic among them . . . and their numbers began thereby to be reduced." Encouraged by the epidemic among the Rus, the Muslims approached the city. The Rus, their chief riding on a donkey, made an unsuccessful sally after which they lost 700 warriors, but evaded encirclement and retreated to the Barda fortress, where they were besieged by the Muslims. Exhausted by the disease and the siege, the Rus "left by night the fortress in which they had established their quarters, carrying on their backs all they could of their treasure, gems, and fine raiment, boys and girls as they wanted, and made for the Kura River, where the ships in which they had issued from their home were in readiness with their crews, and 300 Russes whom they had been supporting with portions of their booty."<ref name="Vernadsky69"/> The Muslims then exhumed from the Rus graves the weapons that had been buried beside the warriors.<ref name="Logan202"/>

[[George Vernadsky]] proposed that [[Oleg of Novgorod]] was the donkey-riding chief of the Rus who attacked Barda. Vernadsky identified Oleg with ''Helgu'', a figure mentioned in the [[Schechter Letter]]. According to that document, Helgu went to [[Persia]] by boat and died there [[Rus'-Byzantine War (941)|after a failed attack]] on [[Constantinople]] in 941.<ref>Vernadsky (1959), p. 270; ''see also, e.g.'', Zuckerman 257-268; Christian 341-345.</ref> On the other hand, [[Lev Gumilev]], drawing on the name of the Rus' leader (as recorded in Arabian sources), hypothesizes that this leader was [[Sveneld]], a Varangian chieftain whose wealth was noted in the [[Primary Chronicle]] under 945.<ref>The Kievan chronicle mentions that the fabulous richness of Sveneld's troops (''[[druzhina]]'') incited such envy of [[Igor of Kiev|Igor]]'s warriors that they attempted to levy tribute from the [[Drevlians]] for the second time in one month. The Drevlians revolted and killed Igor in 944 or 945. Gumilev suggests that, while engaged in his successful Caspian expedition, Sveneld did not take part in Igor's unfortunate raid on Constantinople, which ended ignominously. This scenario also explains the glaring absence of Sveneld's name from Igor's [[Rus'-Byzantine Treaty (944)|treaty with Byzantium]] (944), as preserved in the Primary Chronicle.</ref>

==Destruction of Khazaria==
[[Image:Sarkel.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The site of the Khazar fortress at Sarkel, sacked by Sviatoslav c. 965. Aerial photo from excavations conducted by [[Mikhail Artamonov]] in the 1930's.]]
The sources are not clear about the roots of the conflict between [[Khazaria]] and Rus, so several possibilities have been suggested. The Rus had an interest in removing the Khazar hold on the Volga trade route because the Khazars collected duties from the goods transported by the Volga. Byzantine incitement also apparently played a role. Khazars were the allies of the Byzantines until the reign of [[Romanus I Lecapenus]], who persecuted the [[Jew]]s of his empire. According to the [[Schechter Letter]], the Khazar ruler [[Joseph (Khazar)|Joseph]] responded to the persecution of Jews by "doing away with many [[Christian]]s" and Romanus retaliated by inciting [[Oleg of Novgorod]] (called ''Helgu'' in the letter) against Khazaria.<ref name="Rus"/> 

The conflict may also have been spurred by the Khazars' decision to close passage down the Volga in response to the raid of 943. In the [[Khazar Correspondence]], written around 950-960, the Khazar ruler [[Joseph (Khazar)|Joseph]] reported his role as defender of the Muslim polities of the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] region against Rus incursions: "I have to wage war with them [Rus], for if I would give them any chance at all they would lay waste the whole land of the Muslims as far as [[Baghdad]]."<ref>"Khazar". ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''</ref> Earlier conflict between Muslim elements of the Khazar army and Rus marauders in c. 912 may have contributed to this arrangement and the hostility of the Rus against Khazaria.<ref>Christian  (1999), p. 296</ref> 

In [[965]], [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]] finally went to war against [[Khazaria]].  He employed [[Oghuz]] and [[Pecheneg]] mercenaries in this campaign, perhaps to counter the Khazars' superior [[cavalry]].<ref>Christian (1999), p. 298; Pletneva (1990), p. 18</ref> Sviatoslav destroyed the Khazar city of [[Sarkel]] around 965, and possibly sacked (but did not occupy) the Khazar city of [[Kerch]] on the [[Crimea]].<ref>Christian (1999), p. 298</ref> He subsequently (probably in 968 or 969) destroyed the Khazar capital of [[Atil]].<ref>''See, generally'' Christian  (1999), pp. 297&ndash;298; Dunlop (1954). Artamonov proposed that the sack of Sarkel came after the destruction of Atil. Artamonov (1962), p. 428.</ref> A visitor to Atil wrote soon after Sviatoslav's campaign: "The Rus attacked, and no grape or raisin remained, not a leaf on a branch."<ref>Logan (1992), p. 202</ref> [[Ibn Hawqal]] is the only author who reports the sack of [[Samandar (city)|Semender]], after which the Rus departed for "[[R<U+00FB>m]] and [[al-Andaluz]]"<ref>Ibn Hawkal also wrote that the Rus, "are the ones who of old went to Andalus and then to Barda." The earlier attack on Muslim Spain by "a nation of the [[Majus]]" [Muslim name for [[Zoroastrian]]s and occasionally other pagans] is mentioned by al-Masudi. "Rus", ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''</ref> <!--apparently a reference to Svyatoslav's wars in Bulgaria and the Norman sack of Santiago in 968.-->. 

Sviatoslav's campaign brought the prosperity and independence of Khazaria to an abrupt end. The destruction of Khazar imperial power paved the way for [[Kievan Rus']] to dominate north-south trade routes through the steppe and across the [[Black Sea]], routes that formerly had been a major source of revenue for the Khazars. Moreover, Sviatoslav's campaigns led to increased Slavic settlement in the region of the [[Saltovo-Mayaki]] culture, greatly changing the demographics and culture of the transitional area between the forest and the steppe.<ref>Christian (1999), p. 298</ref>

==Later expeditions==
[[Image:S<U+00D6>179 Gripsholm Runestone.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Gripsholm Runestone]] commemorates the Scandinavians who died in the expedition of [[Ingvar the Far-Travelled]]]]
In 987, Maymun, [[emir]] of [[Derbent]], asked the Rus to help him against local chiefs. The Rus, many of whom appear to have been professional soldiers, arrived on 18 ships. Uncertain of their reception, they sent only one ship to reconnoitre the situation. When its crew were massacred by the local population, the Rus went on to loot the city of Maskat<!--Please do not wikilink. [[Mascat, Oman]] is an unrelated city-->. In 989, this same Maymun is reported to have refused the demand of a local preacher to turn over his Rus mercenaries to him for either conversion to [[Islam]] or death. In the ensuing struggle, Maymun was driven from the city and forced to surrender the Rus soldiers, but he returned in 992.<ref name="Rus"/> 

In 1030, the Rus raided the region of Shirvan; the ruler of [[Ganja]] then paid them much money to help suppress a revolt in Beylagan. Afterwards, the Rus returned home. According to one source, in November 1031 the Rus returned, but were defeated near Baku and expelled. The year of 1032 saw another Rus raid into Shirvan; they were joined by the [[Alans]] and [[Sarir]]. Local Muslims defeated the Rus in 1033. It is unclear to which Rus grouping these raiders belonged. [[Omeljan Pritsak]] suggests that they operated out of a base near the [[Terek]] estuary and had their principal home in [[Tmutarakan]]. Pritsak also speculated<!--his theory is untenable.--> that the Rus, operating from the Caspian basin, shortly thereafter lent support to the [[Oghuz]] in a power struggle in [[Khwarezm]].<ref name="Rus"/> 

The ''Yngvars saga v<U+00ED><U+00F0>f<U+00F6>rla'' describes the last expedition of the Vikings into the Caspian, dated to [[1041]] and possibly connected with the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]]-Byzantine [[Battle of Sasireti]] in which a Varangian force participated around the same time; in the saga much legend is conflated with the historical facts. This expedition was launched from [[Sweden]] by [[Ingvar the Far-Travelled]] (''Ingvar Vittfarne'' in [[Norse language|Norse]]), who went down the Volga into the land of the [[Saracens]] (''[[Saerkland]]'' in Norse). There are no less than twenty-six runic stones, twenty-three of them being in the Lake [[M<U+00E4>laren]] region of [[Uppland]] in Sweden, referring to Swedish warriors who went out with Ingvar on his expedition to the Saracen lands, an expedition whose purpose was probably to reopen old trade routes, now that the Bulgars and the Khazars no longer proved obstacles. A stone to Ingvar<U+2019>s brother indicates that he went east for gold but that he died in the Saracen land, "his body food for eagles." Afterwards, no attempts were made by the Norsemen to reopen the route between the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and Caspian seas.<ref name="Logan202"/><!--where is evidence that the Swedish raid is connected with the Russian raids; the identification is original research. Response: no, it's not original research: it's written in Logan.-->

[[Khaqani]] tells about a Rus raid in 1173 or 1174. [[Peter Benjamin Golden|Peter Golden]] argued that the Rus mentioned by Khaqani were [[Ushkuiniks|Volga pirates]] who came in 73 ships. Simultaneously, the [[Kipchaks]] attacked the cities of [[Derbent]] and [[Shabaran]]. The [[shirvanshah]] [[Ahsitan I]] turned to the Georgian king, [[George III of Georgia|George III]] for aid and together they defeated Rus and the [[Kipchaks]]. Georgian sources, however, do not mention Rus in connection with this event.<ref name="Rus"/><!--where is the evidence that it was not Slavic by 1170s? response: of course, the Ushkuiniks were Slavs. The name Rus was not always applied to Scnadinavians.-->
