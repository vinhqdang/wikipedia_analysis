After the short-lived [[Belarusian People's Republic]] (1918<U+2013>19), Belarus became a [[Republics of the Soviet Union|constituent republic of the Soviet Union]], the [[Byelorussian SSR]].

The final unification of Belarusian lands within its modern borders took place in 1939, when the ethnically Belarusian lands that were part of [[Second Polish Republic|interwar Poland]] were annexed by the USSR and attached to the Soviet Belarus. The territory and its nation were devastated in [[World War II]], during which Belarus lost about a quarter of its population and more than half of its economic resources;<ref name="axell">{{cite book | last = Axell | first = Albert | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Russia's Heroes, 1941<U+2013>45 | publisher = Carroll & Graf Publishers | date= 2002 | location = | pages = 247 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 078671011X }}</ref> the republic recovered<!--"recovered" sounds too cut-and-dried: it remained economically impoverished under the Soviet system, yes?

[[Alexander Lukashenko]] has been the country's president since 1994. During his presidency, Lukashenko has implemented<!--retained?--> Soviet-era policies, such as state ownership of the economy, despite objections from Western governments. Since 1996, Belarus is negotiating with Russia to unify into a single state called the [[Union of Russia and Belarus]].

Most of Belarus's population of 9.85&nbsp;million reside in the urban areas surrounding Minsk and other [[oblast]] (regional) capitals.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://un.by/en/aboutbelarus/population/ |title=About Belarus - Population |accessdate=2007-10-07 |date=2003 |publisher=United Nations Office in Belarus }}</ref> More than 80% of the population are native Belarusians, with sizable minorities of Russians, Ukrainians and Poles. Since a referendum in 1995, the country has had two official languages: [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. The [[Constitution of Belarus]] does not declare an official religion, although the primary religion in the country is [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]].

== Etymology ==
The name ''Belarus'' derives from the term ''[[White Russia]]'', which first appeared in German and Latin [[medieval]] literature. The Latin term for the area was ''Russia Alba''. Historically, the country was referred to in [[English language|English]] as ''White Russia''. It is also claimed by some people that the correct translation is ''White [[Ruthenia]]'' (''White Rus'' phonetically), which either describes the area of Eastern Europe populated by Slavic people or the states that occupied the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.halgal.com/ruthenian.html |title=An Understanding of the Terms 'Ruthenia' and 'Ruthenians |accessdate=2007-03-18 |last=Bielawa |first=Matthew |date=2002 |work=Genealogy of Halychyna/Eastern Galicia }}</ref> The first known use of ''White Russia'' to refer to Belarus was in the late-16th century by Englishman Sir [[Jerome Horsey]].<ref name="alies">{{cite book | last = Alies | first = Bely | title = The chronicle of the White Russia: an essay on the history of one geographical name | publisher = Encyclopedix | date= 2000 | location = Minsk, Belarus | isbn = 985-6599-12-1 }}</ref> During the 17th century, Russian [[tsar]]s used ''White [[Ruthenia|Rus']]'', asserting that they were trying to recapture their heritage from the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].<ref name="alies"/>

Belarus was named ''Belorussia'' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: <U+0411><U+0435><U+043B><U+043E><U+0440><U+0443><U+0441><U+0441><U+0438><U+044F>) in the days of [[Imperial Russia]], and the Russian tsar was usually styled ''Czar of [[Russia|All the Russias]]<U+2014>[[Great Russia|Great]], [[Little Russia|Little]], and [[White Russia|White]]''. ''Belorussia'' was the only [[Russian language]] name of the country (its names in other languages such as English being based on the Russian form) until 1991, when the [[Supreme Soviet]] of the [[Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] decreed by law that the new independent republic should be called ''Belarus'' (<U+0411><U+0435><U+043B><U+0430><U+0440><U+0443><U+0441><U+044C>) in Russian and in all other language transcriptions of its name. The change was made to reflect adequately the [[Belarusian language]] form of the name.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://pravo.kulichki.com/zak/year1991/doc47159.htm |title=Law of the Republic of Belarus - About the name of the Republic of Belarus |accessdate=2007-10-06 |date=1991-09-19 |publisher=Pravo - Law of the Republic of Belarus |language=Russian }}</ref> Accordingly, the name ''Belorussia'' was replaced by ''Belarus'' in English, and, to some extent, in Russian (although the traditional name still persists in that language as well); likewise, the adjective ''Belorussian'' or ''Byelorussian'' was replaced by ''Belarusian'' in English (though Russian has not developed a new adjective).

Belarus has historically been a [[Russian Orthodox]] country, with minorities practicing [[Catholicism]], [[Judaism]], and other religions. Belarusians converted to the Russian Orthodox Church after Belarus was annexed by Russia after the partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Belarus's Roman Catholic minority, which makes up perhaps 10% of the country's population and is concentrated in the western part of the country, especially around [[Hrodna]], is made up of a mixture of Belarusians and the country's [[Polish people|Polish]] and [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]] minorities.

The first major musical composition by a Belarusian was the opera ''[[Faust]]'' by [[Antoni Radziwi<U+0142><U+0142>]]. In the 17th century, Polish composer [[Stanislau Maniushka]] composed operas and chamber music pieces while living in Minsk. During his stay, he worked with Belarusian poet [[Vincent Dunin-Marcinkevich]] and created the opera ''Sielanka'' (''Peasant Woman''). At the end of the 19th century, major Belarusian cities formed their own opera and ballet companies. The ballet ''[[Nightingale (ballet)|Nightingale]]'' by M.

The traditional Belarusian dress originates from the [[Kievan Rus']] period. Because of the cool climate, clothes, usually composed of [[flax]] or [[wool]], were designed to keep the body warm. They were decorated with ornate patterns influenced by the neighboring cultures: Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Russians, and other European nations.

[[Cuisine of Belarus|Belarusian cuisine]] consists mainly of vegetables, meat (especially pork), and breads. Foods are usually either slowly cooked or stewed. A typical Belarusian eats a very light breakfast and two hearty meals, with dinner being the largest meal of the day. Wheat and rye breads are consumed in Belarus, but rye is more plentiful because conditions are too harsh for growing wheat. To show hospitality, a host presents an offering of bread salt when greeting a guest or visitor.<ref>Canadian Citizenship and Immigration - [http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/belarus/eating.html Cultures Profile Project - Eating the Belarusian Way].
