==Writing==
[[Image:Drew Carey Book.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Cover of ''Dirty Jokes and Beer: Stories of the Unrefined'']]
Carey has a history of writing throughout his career including developing his stand-up comedy routines in his early stand-up career, and then moving on to assist in writing sitcoms. In 1997, Carey published his [[autobiography]], ''[[Dirty Jokes and Beer: Stories of the Unrefined]]'' where he shared memories of his early childhood and of his father's death when he was eight.

The book featured large amounts of profanity and, as the title suggests, includes multiple dirty jokes (there was one at the start of each chapter) and references to beer. The book was featured on the New York Times bestseller list for three months.<ref name="ABC.com">{{cite web |title=ABC.com |work=Personnel Files-Drew Carey |url=http://abc.go.com/primetime/drewcarey/bios/drew_carey.html |accessdate=December 6 |accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==Personal life==
A former [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine]] reservist, he adopted his [[crew cut]] hair style during his time in the service. Carey has had [[refractive surgery]] to correct his vision and therefore did not really require glasses (any glasses he wore in public were merely props to help the audience recognize him). However, while this was true for several years, on the [[May 17]], [[2006]] episode of ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live]]'' he revealed that when he turned 40, he actually developed a need for bifocals. Carey currently lives in [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]].<ref name="LAdaily">{{cite web |title=LA Daily News |work=Carey puts little value in "Price" rumors |url=http://www.dailynews.com/ci_6350371?source=most_viewed |accessdate=July 13 |accessyear=2007}}</ref>

On [[October 9]], [[2007]] Carey proposed to Nicole Jaracz. In a statement regarding the engagement, publicist Christina Papadopoulos said, "It will be the first marriage for both.

Since the show ended its nine-year run on ABC in 2004, however, Carey has clarified that he is more of a [[Conservatism|conservative]] with [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] leanings, and that he presented himself as a libertarian to avoid what some conservative critics of the [[List of entertainment industry topics|entertainment industry]] claim is a general [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] [[bias]] against conservatives. On the [[August 18]], [[2006]] ''[[Penn Radio]]'' show with [[Penn Jillette]], Carey did, however, say he was indeed libertarian. He has expressed his distaste for the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]]'s running of the [[War in Iraq]], specifically on the [[September 15]], [[2007]], episode of ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]''.
