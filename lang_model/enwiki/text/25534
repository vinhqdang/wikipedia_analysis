'''''Creatures of Impulse''''' is a stage play by [[English people|English]] [[dramatist]] [[W. S. Gilbert]], with music by composer-conductor [[Alberto Randegger]], which Gilbert adapted from his own short story. Both the play and the short story concern an unwanted and ill-tempered old [[fairy]] who enchants people to behave in a manner opposite to their natures, with [[farce|farcical]] results.

The short story was written for ''[[The Graphic]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Christmas number of 1870, and the play was first produced at the [[Royal Court Theatre|Court Theatre]] on 2 April 1871. It originally included six songs, but three were eventually cut, and some productions dispensed with the music entirely. While the lyrics survive, the music was never published and is lost. Reviews of the play were mostly positive, though it was criticised for the lack of a significant plot or superstructure to support its comic premise. Nonetheless, reviewers found it enjoyable, and it was a modest success, running for 91&nbsp;performances and enjoying revivals into the early part of the 20th&nbsp;century.

Gilbert had already written a considerable body of stories, plays, poems, criticism and other works before writing ''Creatures of Impulse''. He would go on to write the [[libretto|libretti]] to the famous series of [[Savoy operas]] (composed by [[Arthur Sullivan]]) between 1871 and 1896.

From the mid-1860s through the early 1870s, [[W. S. Gilbert]] was extremely productive, writing a large quantity of comic verse, theatre reviews and other journalistic pieces, short stories, and dozens of plays and [[comic operas]]. His output in 1870 included dozens of his popular comic ''[[Bab Ballads]]''; two blank verse comedies, ''[[The Princess (play)|The Princess]]'' and ''[[The Palace of Truth]]''; two comic operas, ''[[Our Island Home]]'' and ''[[The Gentleman in Black]]''; and various other short stories, comic pieces, and reviews appearing in various periodicals and newspapers. In 1871 he was even busier, producing seven plays and operas.<ref name=playlist>{{cite web |url=http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/html/other_gilbert.html |title=Gilbert's Plays <U+2013> Annotated chronological listing|accessdate=21 May 2008|publisher=The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Crowther|first= Andrew|url=http://wsgilbert.co.uk/works.html |title=Gilbert's Non-Dramatic Works|date=|accessdate=3 January 2011 |publisher= W.

Gilbert's dramatic writing during this time was evolving from his early [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesques]] to a more restrained style, as exemplified in his string of blank-verse fairy comedies.<ref>{{cite web |last= Crowther|first= Andrew|url=http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/html/gilbert_l.html |title=The Life of W.

Italian-born [[Alberto Randegger]] was better known as a conductor and professor of singing than as a composer, although he composed several full-length works and numerous vocal pieces in England in the 1860s and 1870s.<ref>Obituary: Alberto Randegger, ''[[The Times]]'', 19 December 1911</ref> He is also remembered for his important 1879 textbook entitled ''Singing''.<ref>{{cite web |last= Johnson|first= Keith|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p174416|pure_url=yes}} |title=Alberto Randegger Biography| year=2006 |accessdate=21 May 2008 |publisher= [[Allmusic]]}}</ref> His music for ''Creatures of Impulse'' was criticised as "extremely undramatic",<ref name=TimesReview /> though others found it "pretty".<ref name=GraphicReview /><ref name=NewYorkTimesReview /> Much of it was cut from revivals of the piece.<ref name=IanBond>{{cite web|url=http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/creature.pdf|title=Creatures of Impulse <U+2013> Annotated libretto|year=1996 |accessdate=21 May 2008 |last=Bond|first= Ian|publisher=The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive|format=PDF}}</ref>

===Genesis of story and play===
Gilbert first published ''Creatures of Impulse'' as a short story, under the title "A Strange Old Lady", in the 1870 Christmas number of ''[[The Graphic]]'', an illustrated weekly newspaper. He later selected it for inclusion in the only collection of his short stories published during his lifetime, ''[[Foggerty's Fairy and Other Tales]]'' (1890), at which point he renamed it to match the theatrical adaptation. Gilbert did not originally intend for the story to be turned into a play;<ref name=FoggertysFairy5>Gilbert (1890), p. 5.</ref> nonetheless, a few months later it was on stage.

He adapted the story into a play for Marie Litton's [[Royal Court Theatre]]. Litton took over the proprietorship of the New Chelsea Theatre in 1871 and renamed it the Royal Court. Its opening attraction was the premi<U+00E8>re of Gilbert's ''[[Randall's Thumb]]'', and when that play proved successful, it was no surprise, as the ''London Echo'' pointed out, that she followed it with another work by Gilbert.<ref name=NewYorkTimesReview /> He often used his previous prose work as the basis of later plays,<ref name=FoggertysFairy5 /> and "The Strange Old Lady" was no exception. Under the new title of ''Creatures of Impulse'', it opened on 2 April 1871 as a companion piece for ''Randall's Thumb''.<ref name=TimesReview /> Successful, it lasted through 91&nbsp;performances and acted as a companion piece to five different plays.<ref name=IanBond/> Marie Litton continued to commission works from Gilbert, including Gilbert's adaptation of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Great Expectations]]'' in 1871, ''[[Broken Hearts]]'' in 1875, various translations of French works, and ''[[The Happy Land]]'' in 1873,<ref name=playlist/> which portrayed members of the British Government on stage and caused such a scandal that it had an unusually long run.<ref>Stedman, pp. 106<U+2013>07.</ref><ref name=Meisel>Meisel, pp. 278<U+2013>300.</ref>

===Subsequent productions and publications===
The play was revived in 1872 at the Court Theatre,<ref>G<U+00E4>nzl, p. 38.</ref> in 1873 at the [[Queen's Theatre, Long Acre|Queen's Theatre]], and in 1874 at the [[Vaudeville Theatre]] (running for over 100 performances), all in London.<ref>Moss, Simon.

Substantial cuts were made in the text by the time the play was collected for ''Original Plays, Fourth Series'' (1911), the last volume of the only large-scale collection of Gilbert's stage work.<ref>Gilbert died before he could check the [[Galley proof|proofs]] of the last few works in that volume, and so it is not known whether or not this state of the libretto is what he intended.

==Synopsis==
'''''Note:''' The short story takes place at an inn on the road from [[London]] to [[Norwich]], but the play calls for [[Alsace|Alsatian]] costumery. Otherwise, the plots of the short story and play are nearly identical. The summary below uses the names from the play and notes significant changes in plot between the play and short story.''<ref name=FoggertysFairy>Gilbert (1890), pp. 161<U+2013>73.</ref><ref name=OriginalPlays>Gilbert (1911), pp. 309<U+2013>27.</ref> ''There are also various small changes to the order of events, not described.''<ref>For example, in the story Peter is cursed, then Jenny, the Sergeant, and finally the miser. In the play, the order is Peter, then the Sergeant, then Pipette (Jenny's name in the play), then the miser. Compare Gilbert (1890), pp. 163<U+2013>66 with Gilbert (1911), pp. 318<U+2013>23.</ref>

[[Image:Creatures of Impulse - book.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The first page of ''Creatures of Impulse'' in ''[[Foggerty's Fairy and Other Tales]]'']]
At "The Three Pigeons" inn, it is a good day for some: the miser Boomblehardt has been out collecting rents from his tenants, and Sergeant Klooque, hero of [[Johannesburg]], has just arrived at the inn on leave and may now flirt with any lady he chooses, without the need to pretend they are his relatives in order to get around his tyrannical Colonel. However, it is not a good day for Martha, the landlady of the inn: staying there is a strange old lady, a mischievous fairy, who refuses to pay or to leave, and who needs neither food nor water. This is substantially cutting into Martha's profits. She enlists Boomblehardt and Klooque, the cowardly farmer Peter,{{ref label|a|a|a}} and her extremely shy niece, Pipette, to help solve this problem.

Peter, not cowardly enough to fear an old woman, nor superstitious enough to believe in her power, threatens the old fairy, trying to chase her away. Unfortunately, she does indeed have fairy powers and casts a spell that forces Peter to threaten anyone he encounters or, if alone, to fight imaginary enemies. Peter flees before he can get himself into trouble by threatening anyone bigger than him, calling out challenges as he goes. Sergeant Klooque approaches the old woman next and tries to use his military charm to win her over. It turns out that she hates soldiers, and she strikes out with her stick, making him duck and dodge. She then casts a spell to make his cringing, dodging and ducking permanent, intending that he lose his reputation and be branded a coward. Pipette arrives and watches his behaviour in astonishment. "He's showing you how he fought the enemy at Johannesburg,"<ref name=Gilbert1911321>Gilbert (1911), p. 321</ref> exclaims the old lady, but he replies "No, my dear!" I'm showing you how the enemy fought us. This is the way they retreated".<ref name=Gilbert1911321 /> He leaves, cringing and pleading for imaginary attackers to stop as he goes.

Pipette then tries to coax the old lady into leaving, kissing and hugging her, and appealing to her (hoped for) good nature. The old lady sees through her attempt, and in punishment for her "telling stories"<ref name=Gilbert1911322>Gilbert (1911), p. 322.</ref> compels her to kiss and cuddle all she meets. She cries out in protest that she's too shy for such behaviour, but the old lady assures her that she'll "get over [her] shyness after a year or two of that sort of thing".<ref name=Gilbert1911322 /> Boomblehardt approaches next, and Pipette flings herself on him, crying "Kiss me!". He obliges. She responds, "How dare you take such a liberty! You insolent old man! Kiss me". And so he does. She boxes his ears, much to his confusion, and then retreats into the inn in tears.<ref name=Gilbert1911323>Gilbert (1911), p. 323.</ref>

Boomblehardt then meets with the old woman. The miser has heard that the strange old lady does not need to eat and offers to help her stay at the inn if she will teach him her secret of how to avoid wasting money on food.{{ref label|b|b|b}} He offers her a golden guinea. The fairy decides that someone that miserly must be punished and compels him to continue passing out guineas to all he meets.<ref>Gilbert (1911), pp. 323<U+2013>24</ref>

[[Image:The Graphic - Creatures of Impulse.png|thumb|250px|Pipette throws herself at the Sergeant, in an illustration from ''[[The Graphic]]'', 1871.]]
Soon complications arise from these curses. Boomblehardt finds Sergeant Klooque's curse hilarious and decides that if he must give out money, the sergeant is as good as any other. The shy Pipette throws herself at Sergeant, who unwillingly ducks and dodges, trying to avoid her. When Peter arrives, he is forced to get into a fight with the sergeant over her, at which, to his surprise, the brave sergeant cowers, dodges, and ducks. Boomblehardt continues passing out guineas, his fortune dribbling away. Then Martha chases her customers out of the inn with a broom: She too has been cursed. Everyone has fallen under the fairy's ironic curses, forced to behave in a manner contrary to his or her intrinsic nature.

Now the old lady makes her crucial mistake:<ref name=Gilbert1890172>Gilbert (1890), p. 172 makes it explicit that this is a tactical error on her part.</ref> She heads downstairs to check on her mischief, and the cursed group all run up to her to beg her to relent. They all behave as compelled by their curses: Peter threatens her, Pipette tries to kiss her, the sergeant ducks away from her, the miser offers her money, and the landlady keeps trying to chase her out with a broom. The chaos is overwhelming: "In short, the Old Lady, who was much more than a match for each of them taken singly, was overpowered by numbers".<ref name=Gilbert1890172 /> She is left with no choice but to relent, release the spells and leave, vanquished and embarrassed.<ref name=OriginalPlays />

The short story continues a bit further, making explicit some elements that are only hinted at in the play:
<blockquote>
<p>The really curious part of this story is that, after everything had been explained, and all had been restored to their normal courses of action, none of the personages involved in it married each other. They were all so annoyed at having made such fools of themselves that they walked out of the inn in different directions, and were never seen or heard of again.</p>
<p>Except Peter, who, seeing nothing to be ashamed of in showing such undaunted courage, remained and kept the "Three Pigeons," and prospered remarkably to the end of his days.<ref name=FoggertysFairy173>Gilbert (1890), p. 173.</ref></p></blockquote>

That no one marries at the end of the play was a daring innovation for Victorian theatre, and the reviewer from ''Era'' mentioned his surprise at this.<ref name="Stedman88"/>

'''Synopsis notes''':<br>
{{note label|a|a|a}} In the short story, Peter is instead her nephew. This has no effect on the plot.<br />
{{note label|b|b|b}} In the story, Boomblehardt's equivalent, Verditter, is instead courting the landlady, as her inn is profitable and she has some fine silver; therefore, he tries to bribe the fairy to leave in order that he may make money elsewhere.<ref>Gilbert (1890), pp. 165<U+2013>66</ref>

As was common in Victorian drama, a woman (Maggie Brennan) [[breeches role|played a young man]] (Peter).<ref name=Stedman88>Stedman, p. 88.</ref> The play's script assigns dialogue to three numbered villagers in the opening scene. The named character of Jacques has no more lines than any of these and disappears after the first page of the script.<ref>Gilbert (1911), pp. 311, 313.</ref> Righton, who first played Boomblehardt, portrayed him as a Jewish caricature.<ref name=TimesReview /><ref name=GraphicReview /><ref name=NewYorkTimesReview /> Gilbert's script did not use a Jewish dialect, and historian Jane Stedman suggests that Righton's increasingly broad portrayal and interpolations show that Gilbert had little control of Righton's portrayal of the part.<ref name=Stedman88/>

==Songs==
The number of songs varied from production to production. The version submitted to the Lord Chamberlain had six songs,<ref name=IanBond /> and an early review in ''The Times'' wrote that it was "overweighted with a quantity of extremely undramatic music",<ref name=TimesReview /> though the ''London Echo'' thought the music was "pretty".<ref name=NewYorkTimesReview /> Nonetheless, the version printed in Gilbert's ''Original Plays'' (1911) cut these six songs to three, and some productions omitted the songs entirely.<ref name=IanBond />

The list of songs in the licence copy is:<ref name=IanBond />
# "Did you ever know a lady so particularly shady" <U+2013> Jacques and villagers<ref>Jacques and the villagers are said to be on stage when the curtain rises. It is not actually ''specified'' that Jacques or anyone else sings in the opening chorus. See Gilbert (1911), p. 311.</ref>
# "Some people love Spring" <U+2013> Boomblehardt
# "At home at last all danger past" <U+2013> Sergeant Klooque
# "A soldier in the King's Hussars" <U+2013> Sergeant Klooque, Pipette, and Peter
# "With furious blow" <U+2013> Peter, Pipette, Sergeant Klooque, and Martha
# "Finale: Go away, ma'am, go away, ma'am" <U+2013> ensemble

While the lyrics survive, none of the music was ever published, and it has been lost.<ref name=IanBond /> The version in ''Original Plays'' omits the second verse of Nos. 1 and 6 and cuts Nos. 2, 3, and 5.

==Critical reception==
Reviews for the play were generally favourable, but it was criticised for its loose structure and lack of a substantial plot. ''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' opined: "Amusing, simple, and ingenious, 'Creatures of Impulse' is another, though a slight, addition to the successes of its author".<ref>"Music and the Drama", ''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), 22 April 1871; Issue 2, p. 651.</ref> The ''London Echo'' compared the piece to a "[[burletta]] of the stamp that was in vogue a hundred years ago, resembling [[Midas (burletta)|''Midas'']], perhaps, more nearly than that of any modern burlesque", and wrote that it "contains pretty music, and smart if not witty dialogue, a semi-moral and a semi-plot".<ref name=NewYorkTimesReview>''The London Echo'', quoted in "Foreign Affairs", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 7 May 1871, p. 5.</ref> ''[[The Graphic]]'' concluded that "Although it occupies only an hour in performance, the story is well told and the piece is exceedingly amusing" and praised the acting. Righton received special praise for his portrayal of Boomblehardt: "No character on stage perhaps ever made audiences laugh more in so short a time".<ref name=GraphicReview>"The Theatres" in ''[[The Graphic]]'' (London, England), 22 April 1871, Issue 73</ref> In an 1882 assessment of the piece for amateur theatre societies, M. E. James noted that "The singing is a great addition. It is altogether an amusing bit of nonsense, and very original".<ref>James, p. 30.</ref>

''[[The Times]]'' review was less positive than most, saying that although the play was good, more was expected of Gilbert:
{{bquote|As ''[[noblesse oblige]]'', so does great success become liable to a certain penalty. Had the little piece we have just described been the work of some unknown hand we might have accepted it as an agreeable trifle, displaying more than common ingenuity in its invention, and, with the aid of picturesque costumes, lively setting, and a pretty decoration, gracefully concluding the evening's entertainment, although overweighted with a quantity of extremely undramatic music. But with the remembrance of ''[[The Palace of Truth]]'' fresh in our minds, we cannot help a feeling of disappointment when we find the author of that really poetical work coming forward as the writer of another "fairy tale," so immeasurably inferior....&nbsp;[T]he fairy only enchants her victims to disenchant them at pleasure, without arriving at any result, and we have a good foundation with scarcely any superstructure whatsoever.<ref name=TimesReview>"Court Theatre" in ''[[The Times]]'', 19 April 1871, p. 8, col. 2.</ref>}}
