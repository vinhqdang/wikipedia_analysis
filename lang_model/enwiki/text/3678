'''Irving Isadore Gottesman''' (born December 29, 1930) is a professor of [[psychology]] who has devoted most of his career to the study of the [[genetics]] of [[schizophrenia]]. He has written 17 books and more than 290 other publications, mostly on schizophrenia and [[behavioral genetics]], and created the first academic program on behavioral genetics in the United States. He has won awards such as the [[Hofheimer Prize for Research]], the highest award from the [[American Psychiatric Association]] for psychiatric research. Gottesman is a professor in the psychology department at the [[University of Minnesota]], where he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]].

A native of Ohio, Gottesman studied psychology for his undergraduate and graduate degrees, became a faculty member at various universities, and spent most of his career at the [[University of Virginia]] and the University of Minnesota. He is known for researching schizophrenia in [[Twin#IdenticalTwins|identical twins]] to document the contributions of genetics and the family, social, cultural, and economic environment to the onset, progress, and inter-generational transmission of the disorder. Gottesman has worked with researchers to analyze hospital records and conduct follow-up interviews of twins where one or both were schizophrenic. He has also researched the effects of genetics and the environment on human violence and variations in [[Intelligence#Human intelligence|human intelligence]]. Gottesman and co-researcher [[James Shields (psychiatric geneticist)|James Shields]] introduced the word [[epigenetics]]<U+2014>the control of genes by biochemical signals modified by the environment from other parts of the genome<U+2014>to the field of [[psychiatric genetics]].

Gottesman has written and co-written a series of books which summarize his work. These publications include [[raw data]] from various studies, their statistical interpretation, and possible conclusions presented with necessary background material. The books also include first-hand accounts of schizophrenic patients and relatives tending to them, giving an insight into jumbled thoughts, the disorder's primary symptom. Gottesman and Shields have built models to explain the cause, transmission, and progression of the disorder, which is controlled by many genes acting in concert with the environment, with no cause sufficient by itself.

==Background==

Gottesman was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1930, to Bernard and Virginia Gottesman (n<U+00E9>e Weitzner),<ref name="Marquis biographies online">{{cite web| url = https://cgi.marquiswhoswho.com/OnDemand/Default.aspx?last_name=Gottesman&first_name=Irving| title = Marquis biographies online: Profile details Irving I.

He was educated at Miles Standish Elementary and a public school in Cleveland's [[Shaker Heights, Ohio|Shaker Heights]]. After leaving school, Gottesman joined the [[United States Navy]], where he was given a scholarship and the rank of [[midshipman]], and was assigned to the [[Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps]] at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] in Chicago. He first specialized in physics but changed to [[psychology]],<ref name="Gold medal award 2007">{{cite journal| title = Gold medal award for life achievement in the science of psychology| journal = American Psychologist| year = 2007| volume = 62| issue = 5| pages = 385<U+2013>387| doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.62.5.394}}</ref> receiving his [[B.S. degree]] in 1953.<ref name="Marquis biographies online"/>

Gottesman did his graduate work at the University of Minnesota, which then patterned its [[clinical psychology]] program on the [[Boulder model]], which emphasized research theory and clinical practice. He joined the graduate program in 1956 after three years with the Navy, supported by the [[G.I. Bill|Korean War G.I.

His Ph.D. thesis, submitted to ''[[Psychological Monographs]]'', was rejected before a review on the grounds that the [[nature versus nurture|nature<U+2013>nurture issue]] it addressed had already been settled in favor of nurture.

Gottesman began his career at [[Harvard University]] as a social relations and psychology lecturer. This non-tenure-track position ended after three years.

== Scientific contributions ==
=== Studies on schizophrenia and psychopathology ===

Gottesman first studied the genetics of schizophrenia on a large scale using the Maudsley<U+2013>Bethlem register of twin admissions for 16 years. Later he worked on psychiatric genetics and [[genomics]]. In his Twin Cities MMPI study, part of his Ph.D. thesis, Gottesman found high levels of inheritance in the scales related to schizophrenia, [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[anti-social personality disorder]], and social introversion.<ref name="Gold medal award 2007"/> Genes strongly influenced social introversion and aggressive tendencies. This led to further studies on personality traits of identical twins such as the [[Minnesota Study of Identical Twins Reared Apart]].{{r|Morrison 2007}}

Analyzing the results of the Maudsley<U+2013>Bethlem study, Gottesman and Shields devised the multi-element, polygenic causation model for schizophrenia. The book that summarized and expanded on the study, ''Schizophrenia and Genetics: A Twin Study Vantage Point'', argued that schizophrenia is a product of several genes acting together, and introduced the techniques of precise analysis in the field of behavioral genetics.{{r|Morrison 2007}}Gottesman and Shields introduced terms such as "reaction ranges/surface", "[[endophenotype]]" and "[[Epigenetics|epigenetic puzzle]]" into the behavioral sciences.<ref name="Gold medal award 2007"/> The threshold model hypothesized that both genetic and environmental risks combined to produce schizophrenia, and pushed an individual into a diagnosable condition when their influence grew strong enough. The reaction range concept is the idea that the genes and the environment control behavior, but with separate upper and lower limits on the strength of that control in each case, a concept now part of basic psychology.<ref name="About Irving I. Gottesman 2011"/> Before the study, the prevailing opinion was that schizophrenia originated from bad parental relationships.{{r|Morrison 2007}} The researchers showed identical twins were more likely to either have or not have schizophrenia together, concluding the disorder was the "outcome of a genetically determined developmental predisposition".<ref name="Rosenthal 1973">{{cite journal| title = Book reviews: etiology of psychosis| last = Rosenthal| first = D.| journal = [[Science (magazine)|Science]]| year = 1973
| volume = 179| issue = 4078| pages = 1117<U+2013>1118| doi = 10.1126/science.179.4078.1117}}</ref>

The Maudsley<U+2013>Bethlem study also hypothesized that schizophrenia was caused by a mixture of many small traits working together. These endophenotypes could be used for diagnosis.{{r|Morrison 2007}} Endophenotypes have been interpreted as a link between genes and the final behavior, acted on by the environment and chance elements, with biochemical and epigenetic influences changing the genome but not being passed on to children. [[Molecular Biology|Molecular-biological]] studies in genetics have referred to endophenotypes to explain genetic causes of [[psychopathology]].{{sfn|Bertelsen|2011|p=116,122}} The researchers also examined how [[schizoid]]s, those with mild, schizophrenia-like personality disorders, were linked to schizophrenics. Gottesman and Shields extended the term to classes of mild psychological disorders in twins and relatives of schizophrenics.{{sfn|Bertelsen|2011|p=118}} The researchers had hypothesized that schizoida in a twin was how a schizophrenia [[Genetic carrier|carrier gene]], one in a non-schizophrenic still passing on a genetic risk, expressed itself. The twin study did not confirm this.{{sfn|Bertelsen|2011|p=118<U+2013>119}}

In the Denmark study, the researchers evaluated the extent to which genes underpin psychopathology.<ref name="Gold medal award 2007"/> Their twin studies of criminality found that a genetic disposition to poor self-control caused both identical twins to become felons, or to not become felons. They also studied identical twins who were discordant for schizophrenia, where one twin was schizophrenic and the other not, and found children of such twins had equal genetic vulnerability to the disease.{{r|Morrison 2007}} A later study in the mid-1980s, resulting in a paper awarded the [[Kurt Schneider]] Prize, concluded that children of identical twins were at higher risk than those of fraternal twins, indicating the non-schizophrenic identical twin passed on a latent genetic disposition, even if it had not been expressed through schizoida.{{sfn|Bertelsen|2011|p=116,122}}  The Denmark study introduced the concepts of "[[unexpressed genotype]]s"{{emdash}}the latent genetic risk, and "epigenetic control"{{emdash}}the biochemical regulation of how genes work, into the new field of behavioral genetics.<ref name="Gold medal award 2007"/>

=== Studies on delinquency and violence ===

In a 1989 review of the research on juvenile delinquency and violence, Lisabeth DiLalla and Gottesman found delinquency could be transitory or continuous, and genes contributed more to the continuous type.<ref name="Giacomazzi 2005">

They stated that a review by [[Cathy Spatz Widom]] and the studies she cited had missed an element: children maltreated in families might have been targets because their genes might have influenced them into committing antisocial acts and attracting such treatment from parents.<ref name="Koenen 2005">

Gottesman was one of the presenters at the 1995 conference at the [[Aspen Institute]] in Maryland on how strongly genes controlled a person's leaning toward violence and crime. Gottesman presented results from studies on the influence of genes in criminality, stating that identical twins separated at birth were likely to show similar levels of criminal behavior. This concordance indicated that genes influenced such behavior. He did point out that behavioral patterns were strongly influenced by the environment and not set by genes alone.  The conference, funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]], was contentious, with detractors arguing that such studies would lead to minority groups, more likely to be criminals because they had lower social status or were poor, being targeted with gene therapy for violence. Protesters disrupted the conference and swarmed into the auditorium. Gottesman reasserted his belief that scientists should proceed with the research, not waiting for humanity to become ethical enough not to misuse it.<ref name="Goodman 1995">{{cite journal| title = News: Crime and genetics conference breeds further controversy| journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]| last = Goodman| first = L.| year = 1995| volume = 377| page = 276| doi = 10.1038/377276a0}}</ref><ref name="Roush 1995">{{cite journal| title = Conflict marks science conference| last = Roush| first = W.| journal = Science| year = 1995| volume = 269| issue = 29| pages = 1808<U+2013>1809| doi = 10.1126/science.7569909}}</ref>

=== Work on IQ ===



In 1972, Gottesman was called before the United States Senate by senator [[Walter Mondale]] to discuss the then 15-point IQ gap separating African Americans and white Americans. Gottesman testified that genes influenced IQ, but only in conjunction with elements such as schooling, money, and nutritious food from childhood onwards.{{r|Morrison 2007}} In 2003, he and colleagues published a study showing that [[heritability]] was higher for IQ differences within high socioeconomic status (SES) people than among low SES people. Genes influenced differences in test scores more in high SES children than in low SES children.<ref name= "Wrestling with behavioral genetics 2006">{{cite book| title = Wrestling with behavioral genetics: Science, ethics and public conversation| editors = Erik Parens, Audrey R.

=== Humanistic views ===

Gottesman has researched and published about the abuse of genetic research in [[Nazi Germany]], and has provided expert testimony in a Chinese human rights case involving schizophrenia in the family. His scholarly books on schizophrenia have also focused on the human costs of the disorder. In ''Schizophrenia Genesis: The Origins of Madness'', he provided chapters in which patients describe their experiences of the disease, and those of their families.<ref name="Mufson 1991">{{cite journal| title = Book review: Schizophrenia genesis: The origins of madness| last = Mufson| first = M.| journal = [[The New England Journal of Medicine]]| year = 1991| volume = 324| issue = 324| page = 1821| doi = 10.1056/NEJM199106203242523}}</ref> Gottesman has emphasizedtha genetics influences patients' behavior in concert with the family, social, economic, and cultural contexts.<ref name="About Irving I.

== Books ==

Gottesman has authored nine books, all related to schizophrenia and psychiatric genetics.

=== ''Schizophrenia and Genetics: A Twin Study Vantage Point'' ===

Gottesman and Shields published ''Schizophrenia and Genetics'' to document their twin-study research at the Maudsley Hospital in London, the work that in part earned them the Hofheimer Prize for Research,{{r|Pilot 1974}} the highest award for psychiatric research from the American Psychiatric Association. <ref name="APA">{{cite web| url = http://www.psych.org/researchers/research-training-and-funding/apa-award-for-research-in-psychiatry| title = APA award for research in psychiatry: Call for submissions| publisher = American Psychiatric Association| accessdate = July 27, 2012}}</ref> The study expanded on an earlier one by Eliot Slater at the same hospital, covering 24 identical and 33 fraternal twins, with at least one from every pair a schizophrenic being treated at the hospital between 1948 and 1964.<ref name="Pilot 1974">{{cite journal| title = Book reviews: ''Schizophrenia and Genetics: A Twin Study Vantage Point''. Personality and psychopathology series| last = Pilot| first = M.| journal = [[Psychosomatic Medicine (journal)|Psychosomatic Medicine]]| year = 1973| volume = 36| issue = 2| pages = 186<U+2013>187}}</ref> This study was one of eleven such in the contemporary literature, and the book detailed the methodology and analytic detail differentiating it from the others.<ref name="Rosenthal 1973"/>

Chapters on methodology comprise a third of the book's core. Identical and fraternal twins were classified using fingerprints and [[blood groups]]. Follow-up interviews were recorded to monitor the progress of their patients (the [[probands]]) and their twins, some schizophrenic and others not.<ref name="Leonard 1978">{{cite journal
| title = Schizophrenia and Genetics: A Twin Study Vantage Point| last = Leonard| first = M.R.| journal = [[The Psychoanalytic Quarterly]]| year = 1978| volume = 47| issue = 6| pages = 131<U+2013>134}}</ref> Two psychological tests{{emdash}}the MMPI and the Object Sorting Test (Goldstein Scheerer Test of Concept Formation){{emdash}}were used to measure mental traits and functioning. Case summaries were prepared by the Scandinavian psychiatrist [[Erick Essen-Moller]], and these were sent, with data on identical-or-fraternal-twin status and diagnosis-of-schizophrenia removed, to six judges from the U.S., U.K. and Japan. The judges independently evaluated whether the patients were schizophrenic.<ref name="Falek 1976">{{cite journal| title = Schizophrenia and genetics: A twin study vantage point: Review| journal = [[The American Journal of Human Genetics]]
| last = Falek| first = A.| year = 1976| volume = 28| issue = 6| pages = 630<U+2013>631| pmc = 1685193}}</ref>

Results of studies comprise another third of the core of ''Schizophrenia and Genetics''. The data showed that genes made a person likely to develop schizophrenia under environmental pressures. The study was not designed to find the genes responsible, but the authors hypothesized there would be several acting in tandem.Contextual elements responsible could not be identified, though some, such as an overly protective mother, birth order, natal weight, and social and economic elements were ruled out.<ref name="Leonard 1978"/> Gottesman and Shields found roughly half of identical twins had a shared schizophrenic or non-schizophrenic status, but only one-eleventh of fraternal twins had such a shared diagnosis. MMPI scales coincided among identical twin pairs but not among fraternal twin pairs. The Object Sorting Test showed no useful relations.<ref name="Pilot 1974"/> Those meeker than their twins were more liable to develop schizophrenia where their genes already put them at risk.<ref name="Leonard 1978"/>

The book presents case histories of all the twin-pairs studied and the raw data from the analyses.<ref name="Pilot 1974"/> Its last chapters put the results in the context of existing studies, and presented a new theory and model to explain the causes and continuance of the disorder.<ref name="Falek 1976"/> The environmental aspects the researchers checked drew on existing literature, and multiple judgments were pooled to both compare and mutually cancel differing criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia.<ref name="Rosenthal 1973"/> The theory in the book was that many genes work together to dispose a person to the disorder under certain environmental pressures. The model provided no specific therapeutic insight, but was useful as a guideline for further study.<ref name="Leonard 1978"/>

=== ''Schizophrenia: The Epigenetic Puzzle'' ===

''Schizophrenia: The Epigenetic Puzzle'' outlined the approaches, conclusions and models Gottesman used in his study of schizophrenia. He co-wrote the book with James Shields, who died before it was published. The book introduces methods for diagnosing schizophrenia in a research setting, taking into account national differences in how the disorder was defined, debunked myths such as the mother transmitting schizophrenia, and introduced the concepts of the threshold model and the reaction range.<ref name="Roberts 1983">{{cite journal| title = Book reviews: Schizophrenia: The epigenetic puzzle| last = Roberts| first = D.F.| journal = [[Psychological Medicine]]
| year = 1983| volume = 13| issue = 3| pages = 690<U+2013>692| doi = 10.1017/S0033291700048133}}</ref>

The book provided a tutorial on genetics to make the material self-contained.<ref name="Ginsberg Cancro 1985">{{cite journal| title = Schizophrenia: The Epigenetic Puzzle| last1 = Ginsberg| first1 = G.L.| last2 = Cancro| first2 = R.| journal = The Psychoanalytic Quarterly| year = 1985| volume = 54| pages = 305<U+2013>306}}</ref> Family, adoption and twin studies were investigated to determine  the ways vulnerability to the disorder changed with genetic similarity to the patient. Together they supported the presence of a genetic contribution to the cause and the progress of schizophrenia. Contextual elements such as birth problems and stressful incidents were also analyzed to help the authors build a combined model to explain the disorder.<ref name="Roberts 1983"/> The researchers analyzed populations to determine the role of genes using simplified mathematical models of the influence of genes and the environment on each other, and with no biochemical signal of the disorder to guide them. [[Rue L. Cromwell]], writing in [[PsycCRITIQUES]], wrote that this approach lacked rigor. <ref name="Cromwell">{{cite journal| title = Review by Rue L. Cromwell| last = Cromwell| first = R.L.| journal = PsycCRITIQUES| year = 1984| volume = 29| issue = 2| pages = 112<U+2013>115| doi = 10.1037/022623| ref = harv}}</ref> The role of genes was less emphasized in the results, with a heritability of 70%, than in earlier studies by Kallman. The researchers investigated neuroanatomy, and specifically the neurotransmitter [[dopamine]], as a possible route by which genes influence the functioning of the brain to produce the symptoms of the disorder.<ref name="Roberts 1983"/>

The authors investigated autism and psychiatric disorders among children, but found little relation to adult schizophrenia or genetic influence.<ref name="Roberts 1983"/><ref name="Cromwell"/> They also covered the social implications of the disease, concluding that most schizophrenics were poor because the disorder eroded their resources and abilities. A chapter was devoted to social issues, violence, illnesses, death rates, sexual aspects, and the ability to father or bear children affecting schizophrenics. The authors provided data on the chance of relapse after an episode of the disorder.<ref name="Roberts 1983"/> The book covered new methods and new models for studying schizophrenia.  Because the disorder had no unanimously accepted diagnostic criteria, the researchers asked six clinicians and three colleagues to provide their analyses on the reports on 120 twins, and found an agreement of 86% among the clinicians.

=== ''Schizophrenia Genesis: The Origins of Madness'' ===

''Schizophrenia Genesis: The Origins of Madness'', written in 1991, won the William James award from the [[American Psychological Association]].<ref name="William James book award">{{cite web | url = http://www.apa.org/about/awards/div-1-book.aspx | title = William James book award | publisher = American Psychological Association | accessdate = July 27, 2012}}</ref> It extensively reviewed how science has looked at schizophrenia. The book presented a vulnerability/[[diathesis<U+2013>stress model]] to explain the causes of the disorder and a many-cause, many-gene model to explain how it is passed from parents to children.<ref name="Mufson 1991"/> The book has been translated into Japanese and German.{{r|American experiences: A brilliant madness}} ''Schizophrenia Genesis'' was written for both the lay person and the clinical professional,<ref name="Pogue-Geile 1993">{{cite journal| title = Book Review: Schizophrenia Genesis: The Origins of Madness| last = Pogue-Geile| first = M.F.| journal = Behavior Genetics| year = 1993| volume = 23| issue = 6| pages = 543<U+2013>544| doi=10.1007/bf01068145}}</ref> and provides data, methods of interpreting the data, and an introduction to [[genetic analysis]] as used to analyze role of inheritance in behavior.<ref name="Forman Kammen 1992">{{cite journal| title = Etiology and Nosology: Schizophrenia Genesis: The Origins of Madness| journal = [[American Journal of Psychiatry]]| last1 = Forman| first1 = S.D.| last2 = Kammen| first2 = D.P.V.| year = 1992| volume = 149| issue = 10| pages = 1401<U+2013>1402}}</ref><ref name="Mufson 1991"/> The book also contains accounts of schizophrenics, with an artist depicting own suffering, saying, "I know&nbsp;...&nbsp;it is craziness when every laugh is about me&nbsp;...&nbsp;newspapers suddenly contain cures&nbsp;...&nbsp;sparkles of light are demon eyes."<ref name="Morrison 1991">{{cite news| title = Books: Schizophrenia Genesis: The Origins of Madness| author = Philip Morrison| work = [[Scientific American]]| date = March 1991| pages = 122<U+2013>124}}</ref>

''Schizophrenia Genesis'' starts with the history of schizophrenia. Gottesman takes the view that schizophrenia is a disease of the industrial world.<ref name="Vogel 1991">{{cite journal | title = Book Reviews: Schizophrenia Genesis: The Origins of Madness | last = Vogel | first = F. | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | year = 1991 | volume = 48 | page = 1218}}</ref> because it is not mentioned in the [[Bible]], by the [[ancient Greeks]], the ancient physicians, or authors including [[Shakespeare]]. He saw it first mentioned by physicians in 1809 and by [[Balzac]] in a short story in 1832, showing minimally the disorder had by then been recognized as such.<ref name="Donovan 1993">{{cite journal| title = The ABC's of schizophrenia| journal = Jefferson Journal of Psychiatry| last = Donovan| first = M.| year = 1993
| volume = 11| issue = 1| pages = 70<U+2013>72| url = http://jdc.jefferson.edu/jeffjpsychiatry/vol11/iss1/17 }}</ref> In 1896, Kraepelin defined its symptoms, and his student [[Ernst R<U+00FC>din]] began a genetic study of its transmission in 1916.<ref name="Pogue-Geile 1993"/>} The book noted that schizophrenia existed across cultures and its rates had stayed steady for fifty years.<ref name="Morrison 1991"/>

A chapter was devoted to criteria for determining schizophrenia, with Gottesman preferring those developed by Bleuler to those in the American Psychiatric Association<U+2019>s ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''  (version III-R), the ''[[International Classification of Diseases]]'' (ICD-9) and [[Kurt Schneider]]<U+2019>s method. Diagnosis was based on the ways a person spoke and acted, and the standard measures were hallucinations, delusions, [[Blunted affect|emotional apathy]], jumbled thought, and sudden changes in a person. Gottesman mentioned a disparity in schizophrenia diagnosis after World War II across the Atlantic, when U.S. psychiatric diagnoses quadrupled those of British psychiatrists.<ref name="Donovan 1993"/>

Family studies on schizophrenia were reviewed. That the disorder runs in families did not suggest it was genetically inherited, since cultural transmission occurs from parents to children. Twin and adoption studies were presented as the standard methods to disentangle contributions from genes and the environment.<ref name="Vogel 1991"/> Gottesman used a computer-based method for calculating the odds of becoming schizophrenic based on the many causes.<ref name="Forman Kammen 1992"/> The book examines the problems caused by schizophrenia for relatives of patients and for society at large, larger-scale ones exemplified by the [[eugenics]] policies of states such as Nazi Germany. Two final chapters cover molecular biology and [[neuroanatomy]] briefly.<ref name="Vogel 1991"/> Newer methods of behavioral genetics being researched at the time of publication, such as [[linkage analysis]] which used the likelihood of neighboring genes being inherited together, were not covered.<ref name="Pogue-Geile 1993"/>
