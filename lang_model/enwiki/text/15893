When asked to appear on the show, Colbert believed that he was merely going to an audition, but was "thrilled" when the production staff told him he actually had a part in the episode. Colbert was pleased that his character was named Colby and that his appearance was similar to that of his own, although he had not expected the animators to retain his glasses for the design. He based his performance on [[Tony Robbins]], and described the recording sessions as "the hardest job."<ref name=Colbert>{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/blogs/video/62999/|title=Stephen Colbert Gets Simpsonized!|author=Adam Howard|accessdate=2007-09-26|publisher=[[Alternet]]}}</ref>

==Reception==
Brian Tallerico of ''[[UGO]]'' gave the episode a mixed review (a C), expressing disappointment after the well received ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''. He felt the writers went "right back to their old clich<U+00E9>s and sadly repetitive jokes". He did praise the altered opening sequence.<ref name="Tallerico">{{cite news | author = Brian Tallerico | title = Fox Sunday Nights - 4 TV reviews | publisher = [[UGO]] | url = http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=17859&sectionId=2 | accessdate=2007-09-21}}</ref> Robert Canning of ''[[IGN]]'' also gave the episode 5/10, praising the opening sequence but found most of the episode mediocre, especially [[Stephen Colbert]]'s appearance. Nonetheless, "even a mediocre episode will have a few comic gems hidden inside. The time spent in [[Chicago]] is quite enjoyable, including a great [[Ferris Bueller's Day Off|Ferris Bueller]] sight gag, and life coach Colby delivers a zinger of a line comparing Homer's attitude to that of the [[United States]] of America."<ref name="Canning">{{cite news | author = Robert Canning | title = The Simpsons: "He Loves to Fly and He D'Ohs" Advance Review | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2007-09-21]] | url = http://tv.ign.com/articles/821/821930p1.html | accessdate=2007-09-21}}</ref> Richard Keller of [[TV Squad]] praised the episode, saying "after watching so many recent ones where Homer seemed like a barely functioning mental patient, I wasn't used to a Homer that was actually fairly normal."<ref name="TVSquad"/> [[Al Jean]], the current executive producer of ''The Simpsons'', has called the episode one of his personal favorites.<ref name=moviesonline>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_12524.html|title=The Simpsons Movie Interviews|author=Sheila Roberts|accessdate=2007-08-01|publisher=Movies Online}}</ref>
