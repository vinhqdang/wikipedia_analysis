The '''Nottingham Panthers''' (for sponsorship reasons officially referred to as the '''[[GMB Union|GMB]] Nottingham Panthers''') are an [[ice hockey]] club based in [[Nottingham]], [[England]]. They are currently members of the [[Elite Ice Hockey League]]. The modern day Nottingham Panthers were formed in 1980, and were named after a club of the same name that existed between 1946 and 1960. During the 2006-07 season the Panthers celebrated the sixtieth anniversary of ice hockey's arrival in the city. They play their home games at the [[National Ice Centre (UK)|National Ice Centre]] just east of [[Nottingham City Centre|Nottingham city centre]]. Until 2000 the team played at the [[Nottingham Ice Stadium|Ice Stadium]] which stood on the same site as their current home.

The Panthers are one of the most financially stable and best supported ice hockey clubs<ref>Stewart Roberts, Ice Hockey Annual 2006-07</ref> in the [[United Kingdom]]. They have played at the highest level of British ice hockey throughout their history and are the only team who were founder members of the [[British Hockey League]]'s Premier Division in 1983 who continue to hold membership of the top flight league. During their history the Panthers have won three [[British ice hockey league champions|league titles]], two [[British Championship|Championships]], six [[Autumn Cup|Autumn Cups]] and one [[Challenge Cup (UK Ice Hockey)|Challenge Cup]]. The Panthers are the reigning play off champions having defeated the [[Cardiff Devils]] on [[penalty shootout|penalty shots]] in the 2007 final.

==History==
===1946-60: Original era===

An initial attempt to bring a professional [[ice hockey]] team to [[Nottingham]] was made in 1939 following the completion of the [[Nottingham Ice Stadium|Ice Stadium]]. A team was assembled and brought to the [[United Kingdom]] from [[Canada]] to compete in the 1939-40 [[English National League]] season but were promptly sent home having not played a single game due to the outbreak of [[World War II]].<ref>Mick Holland, ''[[Nottingham Evening Post]] Football Post (November 18, 2006), No. 18, Vol. LXXXVI</ref> Seven years later after the war had been won a second effort to bring ice hockey to the city was begun. With a team of Canadians largely from [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], the Nottingham Panthers played their first competitive game on November 22, 1946 with a 3-2 home victory over the [[Wembley Monarchs]].

[[Image:Panthers46.jpg|left|thumb|300px|The first Nottingham Panthers team]]

The Panthers struggled during their early years with repeated mid table finishes in the league and Autumn Cup competitions. In 1948 [[Archibald Stinchcombe|Archie Stinchcombe]] became head coach, a position he would retain until 1954. Despite a lack of success in their formative years the team had a number of players who would become local heroes including [[forward (ice hockey)|forwards]] [[Les Strongman]] and [[Chick Zamick]]. Zamick became one of the most prolific scorers in the league and won the ''Nottingham Sportsman of the Year'' award on two occasions, defeating sportsmen such as the [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] and [[England national football team|England]] international [[football (soccer)|footballer]] [[Tommy Lawton]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Chick Zamick| work=panthershistory.co.uk Chick Zamick Profile | url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Players/zamick.htm | accessdate=November 30 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref>

Success finally came in the 1950-51 season. After finishing fourth in the Autumn Cup the Panthers won eighteen of their thirty league games and clinched their first ever league title. The team also ended the season having scored the most goals and conceded the least.<ref>{{cite web| author = Panthers History | title = 1950-51 season summary| url = http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/50-51.htm| year = 2007 | accessdate = 2007-02-06 | publisher = Peter Walch (Panthers History) }}</ref> The following season Nottingham lost Chick Zamick to injury and fell to the bottom of the rankings. Success returned in the 1953-54 season when the team won a second league championship after finishing bottom of the Autumn Cup table.

During the summer of 1954 Stinchcombe left his position as coach and was replaced by Zamick. The league structure also underwent change with the [[England|English]] league and it's [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Scottish National League (1932 - 1954)|counterpart]] merging to form a new [[British National League (1954 - 1960)|British National League]]. The Panthers finished second to [[Harringay Racers]] in the twelve team competition. The new league did not prove to be the success people had hoped for and after one season the league's membership fell to five with only the [[Paisley Pirates]] representing Scotland. Despite the league's troubles the 1955-56 season proved to be one of the club's most successful ever. The club won the Autumn Cup at the beginning of the season before clinching their third league title by virtue of having won a single game more than the [[Wembley Lions]].<ref>{{cite web | title=1955-56| work=panthershistory.co.uk | url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/55-56.htm | accessdate=June 5 | accessyear=2007 }}</ref> The Panthers also traveled to [[Sweden]] where they won the [[Ahearne Cup]]. This was the last occasion that the original club would claim any silverware and was the last season in which a Nottingham Panthers team were [[British ice hockey league champions|champions of their league]].

Over the next four years Nottingham rarely threatened the top of the table in either the Autumn Cup or the league. In 1960 however the Panthers took part in the first [[British Championship]] final in thirty years<ref>{{cite web | title=British Championship Winners| work=azhockey.com List of British Championship Winners| url=http://www.azhockey.com/champs/champsGB.html#British Championship | accessdate=November 30 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> where they met the [[Brighton Tigers]]. Nottingham was defeated 3-2 in the first leg but won the second in regulation time by the same scoreline forcing the first [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] period the Panthers had ever taken part in. The Tigers clinched the tie 6-5 after 6.32 of the extra session.<ref>Lawrie Simpkin, Nottingham Evening Post, May 7, 1960, 'Brighton draw in extra time to gain title'</ref> After the 1960 season the British National League collapsed and the Ice Stadium decided to shut down the Nottingham Panthers. Ice hockey would not return to the venue for the next two decades.

===1980-Present: Modern era===
====Ice Stadium years====

The Nottingham Panthers were revived largely thanks to the efforts of Gary Keward.<ref>{{cite web| author = Panthers History | title = Gary Keward information| url = http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Players/kewardg.htm| year = 2007 | accessdate = 2007-02-06 | publisher = Peter Walch (Panthers History) }}</ref> In 1980 the Ice Stadium directors, led by Charles Walker agreed to a request by Keward to give ice hockey another chance and Keward's [[Sheffield Lancers]] relocated to Nottingham taking the name of the team that had occupied the same building twenty years earlier, the Panthers. On September 20, 1980 the modern Panthers took to the ice for the first time defeating the [[Solihull Barons]] 7-4 at the Ice Stadium. 

[[Image:Kewardg.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Gary Keward, the man who brought the Panthers back to Nottingham]]

During their first three seasons the Panthers played in regional leagues, first in the [[English League South]] and then in Section B of the [[British Hockey League]]. In 1983 the British Hockey League reconstituted itself into the first truly national ice hockey league for twenty-three years and Nottingham became one of nine founder members of the league's Premier Division. The Panthers were one of the best supported teams in the league with games regularly selling out<ref>Mick Holland, Nottingham Evening Post Football Post, No. 18, Vol. LXXXVI</ref> but success on the ice eluded them as the team struggled against more established opponents such as the [[Durham Wasps]] and the [[Murrayfield Racers]]. It was not until the appointment of [[Alex Dampier]] as coach in 1985 that the team's fortunes began to change. In his first season Dampier led Nottingham to their first post season since reforming. The Panthers lost each of their four of their quarter final group games and failed to advance to the Finals at [[Wembley Arena]].

In 1986 Nottingham secured their first trophy since reforming and their first overall in thirty years when they defeated the [[Fife Flyers]] 5-4 in [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] to win the [[Autumn Cup|Norwich Union Trophy]] at the [[National Exhibition Centre|NEC]] in [[Birmingham]] in front of a crowd of 5,600.<ref name="chambers>Mike Chambers, Nottingham Panthers Statistical Guidebook 1946-2000</ref> Layton Eratt scored the winning goal after 1:53 of the extra session in a game that had seen both the Panthers and the Flyers lead twice.<ref>Mick Holland, Nottingham Evening Post, November 17 1986, 'Now for the top four'</ref> In the league Nottingham again succeeded in qualifying for the playoffs but again failed to register a point. The team repeated this in the [[British Championship|Championships]] the following season bringing the number of consecutive playoff defeats to twelve.

In 1988-89 the Panthers enjoyed their most successful season since reforming. They finished third in the league and were not only able to register their first win in the playoffs but also advance to the finals at Wembley for the first time. Nottingham met [[Whitley Warriors]] in the semi final, winning the match 8-6. In the Grand Final the following day the Panthers defeated the [[Ayr Bruins]] 6-3, clinching their first [[British Championship|Championship]] title.<ref>Mick Holland, Nottingham Evening Post, April 24 1989, 'Champagne Panthers'</ref> Another Autumn Cup title followed in 1991 but Dampier left the club in 1993 to join the newly formed [[Sheffield Steelers]]. He was replaced by [[Mike Blaisdell]] who would coach the team for the next six years.

Blaisdell assembled a strong team in his second year in charge and in December 1994 the Panthers won the [[Autumn Cup|Benson & Hedges Cup]] with a 7-2 victory in the final over the [[Cardiff Devils]]. The Panthers opened their league campaign with a twenty-one game unbeaten run but four defeats over the final two weekends of the regular season, including an 8-6 home defeat to nearest rivals and eventual champions Sheffield, denied the club their first league championship in 39 years.<ref>Mick Holland, Nottingham Evening Post, March 27, 1995, 'Nightmare end to season of promise'</ref> During the 1995-96 season the Panthers made it to both the Benson & Hedges Cup and play off finals but they were defeated on each occasion by the Steelers.

In 1996 the Panthers became a founder member of the new [[Ice Hockey Superleague]]. Many of Nottingham's British players who had risen through the ranks of the club's youth development system were dropped in favour of [[North America]]n imports. The new league had abolished the [[wage cap]] and remaining restrictions on the number of non-British trained players a club was allowed. Of Nottingham's locally trained contingent only Randall Weber, Ashley Tait and Simon Hunt were retained.<ref>{{cite web | title=1996-97 Player Stats| work=Player Statistics for Panthers players during the 1996-97 season| url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/96-97.htm#Player%20Stats | accessdate=December 4 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> The team acquired Trevor Robins, the club's first imported goaltender since reforming and forwards Marty Dallman, Greg Hadden, Derek Laxdal and Darryl Olsen. The Panthers again started the season strongly, qualifying for the Benson & Hedges Cup final for the third straight season thanks to a strong preliminary group campaign and 6-3 aggregate victory over archrivals Sheffield in the semi final.<ref>Mick Holland, Nottingham Evening Post, November 1 1996, 'Panthers storm to the final'</ref> In the final they defeated the [[Ayr Scottish Eagles]] 5-3, with Nottingham taking the lead at 00.29 and never relinquishing it.<ref>Mick Holland, Nottingham Evening Post, December 9 1996, 'That'll do ice-ly'</ref> After a fourth placed finish in the league the Panthers successful qualified for the Superleague's first playoff finals weekend in [[Manchester]]. In the semi finals they again faced Ayr and this time were involved in the longest game in the history of British ice hockey<ref name="chambers">Mike Chambers, Nottingham Panthers Statistical Guidebook 1946-2000</ref> with the match finishing 5-5 after regulation time and each of the following five periods of ten minutes [[overtime (sport)|overtime]] ending goalless. Only in the sixth period of overtime with the two hour mark of the match nearing, did Jeff Hoad finally score the winner for Nottingham ending the game after 115 minutes and 49 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Gamesheets/97m22.htm|title=Gamesheet for 1997 Championship semi final vs Ayr Scottish Eagles|accessdate=2007-02-10}}</ref> In the final the Panthers met Sheffield where they were defeated 3-1 after taking an early lead.

In 1997 the Panthers [[sports franchising|franchise]] was sold after directors revealed the club was in considerable debt. A buyer was found in [[London]] based businessman Neil Black and his sports management company.<ref>{{cite web| author = Panthers History | title = 1950-51 season summary| url = http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/97-98.htm| year = 2007 | accessdate = 2007-02-06 | publisher = Peter Walch (Panthers History) }}</ref> In Black's second season the Panthers signed one of their strongest ever line-ups. In the Benson & Hedges Cup the Panthers easily qualified from their group before defeating the [[Manchester Storm]] in the semi finals despite being plagued by injuries and facing a full strength Storm side.<ref>Mick Holland, Nottingham Evening Post, November 13 1998, 'Now bring on Ayr in final'</ref> The final saw the Panthers taking on the [[Ayr Scottish Eagles]] in a repeat of the 1996 final. Here Nottingham came from behind to defeat the Eagles 2-1 with [[Finland|Finn]] Pekka Virta scoring both goals.<ref>Mick Holland, Nottingham Evening Post, December 7 1998, 'Victory on ice born in the sun'</ref> In the league the Panthers finished in third, twelve points behind champions Manchester. Nottingham also qualified for the finals of the [[Challenge Cup (UK Ice Hockey)|Challenge Cup]] and the playoffs but the team were defeated in each. In the first, they lost 4-0 to Sheffield in the Challenge Cup despite outshooting their opponents 39-24. A few weeks later, they lost 2-1 to Cardiff in the Championship final despite outshooting the Devils 36-24.<ref>Mike Chambers, Nottingham Panthers Statistical Guidebook 1946-2000</ref> During the course of the season Paul Adey and Greg Hadden scored 141 points between them, four players scored more than twenty goals, six players earned more than thirty assists and seven players achieved thirty or more points.<ref>http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/98-99.htm#PLAYER STATS</ref>

[[Image:98b&hcup.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The Panthers celebrate their 1998 Benson & Hedges Cup victory]]
In 1999 the club lost several players. The organisation was preparing to relocate to a new arena and chairman Neil Black wanted the team on a firm financial footing before the move. Paul Adey ended an eleven year playing career with Nottingham and left for [[Italy]], Trevor Robins joined the [[London Knights (UK)|London Knights]] and the Panthers were unable to retain the services of many of the highest earners on the team. As a result Blaisdell could only sign a weakened side, something which frustrated him. In October the Sheffield Steelers became interested in employing Blaisdell and he walked out on Nottingham amid acrimonious circumstances; ending a six year association with the Panthers.<ref>{{cite web| author = Panthers History | title = 1999-00 season summary| url = http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/99-00.htm| year = 2007 | accessdate = 2007-02-06 | publisher = Peter Walch (Panthers History) }}</ref> Nottingham turned to a former coach to replace Blaisdell with Alex Dampier returning to the club from the [[Newcastle Riverkings]]. Lacking the spending power of many of their rivals Nottingham finished sixth in the eight team league. The club faired better in the Challenge Cup where it made the final for the second successive year but the team was defeated 2-1 at [[London Arena]] by Mike Blaisdell's Steelers. On March 22, 2000 the Panthers hosted Newcastle in their final game at the Ice Stadium. Jamie Leach scored Nottingham's final goal at their home of fifty-four years but the club was defeated 2-1 in overtime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Gamesheets/2000m22.htm|title=homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Gamesheets/2000m22.htm<!--INSERT TITLE-->|accessdate=2007-02-10}}</ref>

====Move to the National Ice Centre====

The Panthers moved to the new [[National Ice Centre (UK)|National Ice Centre]] in September 2000. The new building held more than double the capacity of their old rink and [[sports attendance|attendance]] levels increased by 72%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/2000-01.htm#summary|title=homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/2000-01.htm#summary<!--INSERT TITLE-->|accessdate=2007-02-10}}</ref> The team endured a terrible first season in their new home. They barely scraped into the elimination rounds of the [[Benson & Hedges Cup (UK Ice Hockey)|Benson & Hedges Cup]], and were [[single-elimination tournament|knocked out]] at the semi final stage by the Steelers. In the league the Panthers suffered a dire first half of the season and, by [[Christmas]], the team faced the prospect of not qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since 1985. Form improved during the second half of the season, and the team won five of their first seven home games during 2001 including a 6-4 victory over the Sheffield Steelers marred by a violent bench clearance brawl.<ref>{{cite web| author = BBC | title = Brawl taints Panthers' victory | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1163606.stm | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2006-12-29 | publisher = bbc.co.uk | date = 2001 }}</ref> By the end of the season, Nottingham had given themselves a good chance of qualifying for the playoffs and in their final game faced the [[Newcastle Jesters]] away in a crucial match between eighth and ninth place teams. The Panthers required a win in regulation time, something they had not done away from their home ice all season, the Jesters needed only to tie. With 10.1 seconds to go the game was locked at 2-2, but with an [[extra attacker]] they won a [[faceoff]] next to the Newcastle goal and Robert Nordmark scored with 4.4 seconds remaining to take the Panthers into the playoffs and eliminate Newcastle.<ref>{{cite web | author = BBC | title = Panthers progress in dramatic finale | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1202464.stm | year = 2006 | accessdate 2006-12-29 | publisher = bbc.co.uk | date = 2001}}</ref> Their qualification for the playoffs failed to inspire the team and their 5-0 win over a financially troubled Sheffield Steelers<ref>{{cite web | author = BBC | title = Steelers mauled by Panthers| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/northern_ireland/1219296.stm| year = 2007 | accessdate 2007-02-06 | publisher = bbc.co.uk | date = 2001}}</ref> was their only victory of the post season.<ref>{{cite web| author = Panthers History | title = 2000-01 Playoff summary| url = http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/2000-01.htm#PLAY OFFS | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2007-02-06 | publisher = Peter Walch (Panthers History) }}</ref>

[[Image:The City of Nottingham - Summer 04 044.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The National Ice Centre - Nottingham's home since 2000]]

The following season numerous changes were made to the playing staff and goalscoring legend Paul Adey returned to the club as coach. Nottingham would eventually finish in fourth place in a league now reduced to seven members, two points off the second place [[Ayr Scottish Eagles]] but a distant twenty-three points behind champions [[Belfast Giants]]. In the Championships the Panthers won only once in the preliminary stages and finished sixth overall. One of the highlights of the season came in a challenge game against [[HC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]] on [[Boxing Day]] which saw the Panthers hold the [[Russia]]n side to a 3-3 draw.<ref>{{cite web| author = Mick Holland (Nottingham Evening Post)| title = Nottingham Evening Post article via Panthers History| url = http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/2001-02.htm#preseason | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2006-12-31 | publisher = Peter Walch (Panthers History) |date = 2002 }}</ref>

In 2003 the [[Ice Hockey Superleague|Superleague]] collapsed after financial problems; it was left with only five members<ref>{{cite web| author = BBC | title = Eagles forced out | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/2477323.stm | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2006-07-02 | publisher = bbc.co.uk |date = 2002 }}</ref> and faced the prospect of having only three.<ref>{{cite web| author = BBC | title = Bees to quit Superleague | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/2535681.stm | year 2006 | accessdate = 2006-12-27 | publisher = bbc.co.uk | date = 2002 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author = London Knights | title = The Knights' Future | url = http://www.londonknights.co.uk/archives/news_archive_knights_future.htm | year = 2006 | accessdate 2006-12-31 | publisher = londonknights.co.uk | date = 2003}}</ref>In a greatly weakened league the Panthers finished the league season in third place; lost 3-2 in the [[Challenge Cup (UK Ice Hockey)|Challenge Cup]] final to the Steelers and were eliminated 4-3 in the semi finals of the playoffs by the [[London Knights (UK)|London Knights]], who scored the game winning goal with just 0.2 seconds remaining.<ref>{{cite web| author = BBC | title = Giants to face Knights| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/2920999.stm | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2006-07-02 | publisher = bbc.co.uk |date = 2003 }}</ref>

After a summer which saw uncertainty over which league the Panthers would be taking part in<ref>{{cite web| author = Sport Focus | title = Governing Body Decline to Affiliate Elite League | url = http://www.sportfocus.com/newspub/story.cfm?id=2530 | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2006-06-25 | publisher = sportfocus.com |date = 2003 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| author = BBC | title = Elite League "will go ahead" | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/2952464.stm | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2006-07-02 | publisher = BBC News |date = 2003 }}</ref> and even uncertainty over the future of the club itself,<ref>{{cite web| author = Panthers History | title = Nottingham Panthers 2003-04 season information | url = http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/2003-04.htm | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2006-12-29 | publisher = Peter Walch (Panthers History) |date = 2003 }}</ref> Nottingham became a founding member of the new [[Elite Ice Hockey League]].  Changes to regulations regarding the number of non [[United Kingdom|British]] trained players and a lower [[wage cap]] necessitated numerous changes to the squad and in came a number of highly rated British players including [[forward (ice hockey)|forwards]] David Clarke and Marc Levers and several new imports including [[Finland|Finns]] Kim Ahlroos and Mikko Koivunoro and [[Canada|Canadian]] John Craighead.  The new team started strongly and by the end of the year Nottingham were at the top of the table.  However they struggled against archrivals and chief opponents Sheffield Steelers who were able to overtake the team after a string of wins over the Panthers, before establishing a commanding lead at the top of the table.  Eventually Nottingham finished in second place, their highest league finish in twelve years.  The team also qualified for the Challenge Cup final after a dominating 11-5 aggregate victory over the [[Belfast Giants|Giants]] in the semi final.  Their opponent in the two-legged final was again the Steelers, a team that Nottingham had failed to beat in each of the six finals the two club's had contested.  The first leg ended in a 1-1 tie in [[Nottingham]], with David Clarke scoring for the home side.  In the second leg at [[Sheffield Arena]] the Panthers raced to an early two goal lead however Sheffield dominated much of the remainder of the game and eventually leveled the score, forcing overtime.  After only 53 seconds of the extra session Kim Ahlroos scored the winning goal, ending an eight year wait for the Panthers to beat the Steelers in a showpiece final, and securing the club's first silverware in six seasons.<ref>{{cite web| author = Panthers History | title = Challenge Cup Final Second Leg gamesheet| url = http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Gamesheets/2004m17.htm | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2006-12-29 | publisher = Peter Walch (Panthers History) |date = 2004 }}</ref> The Panthers followed up their trophy win with a strong playoff campaign, but after a 6-1 win over the [[Manchester Phoenix]] in the semi final, the Steelers avenged their Cup defeat with a narrow 2-1 win in the Grand Final.

[[Image:Final07.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Inside the National Ice Centre before the 2007 Play Off Final]]

Their Challenge Cup success saw them earn a place in the [[Continental Cup]], the team's first competitive foray into [[Europe]]an competition since 1956. The Panthers were placed into a group with host team [[Gothiques d'Amiens]], [[Italy|Italian]] side [[HC Milano Vipers|Milano Vipers]] and [[Slovenia]]n side [[Olimpija Ljubljana]]. Nottingham tied their first game against Milan before recording 1-0 and 3-1 victories over the Slovenians and French and narrowly missed out on a place in the second round of the competition due to Milan's better goal difference.<ref>{{cite web| author = Panthers History | title = 2004-05 Continental Cup summary| url = http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/2004-05.htm#CONTINENTAL| year = 2006 | accessdate = 2006-12-31 | publisher = Peter Walch (Panthers History) |date = 2005 }}</ref> Domestically the team struggled for much of season and only during the end of season playoffs did the Panthers replicate the form they showed in Europe where despite being depleted by injuries they qualified for the a second successive Grand Final, losing 2-1 in overtime to eventual [[Grand Slam]] winners [[Coventry Blaze]].<ref>{{cite web| author = Panthers History | title = 2004-05 Playoff summary| url = http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/2004-05.htm#PLAY%20OFFS | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2006-12-31 | publisher = Peter Walch (Panthers History) |date = 2005 }}</ref>

In the summer of 2005 Paul Adey left his position as coach and was replaced by former coach [[Mike Blaisdell]]. Despite such a high profile signing of the winningest coach in [[United Kingdom|British]] ice hockey history<ref>{{cite web| author = Ice Hockey Journalists UK | title = Mike Blaisdell| url = http://www.ihjuk.co.uk/hall_of_fame/blaisdell.htm | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2006-12-31 | publisher = Ice Hockey Journalists UK |date = 2004 }}</ref> the Panthers finished third in the league and failed to reach the finals weekend for the first time since 2002.
