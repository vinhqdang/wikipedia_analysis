The '''Industrial Revolution''' was a major shift of technological, socioeconomic, and cultural conditions in the 18th century. It began in [[Great Britain|Britain]] and spread throughout the world. During that time, an economy based on manual labour was replaced by one dominated by industry and the manufacture of [[machine]]ry. It began with the mechanisation of the [[textile]] industries, the development of iron-making techniques and the increased use of refined coal.  Trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of [[canal]]s, improved roads and [[Rail transport|railways]]. The introduction of [[steam engine|steam power]] (fuelled primarily by coal) and powered machinery (mainly in [[textile manufacturing]]) underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity.<ref>Business and Economics.

The period of time covered by the Industrial Revolution varies with different historians.

The first Industrial Revolution merged into the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] around 1850, when technological and economic progress gained momentum with the development of steam-powered [[ship]]s, railways, and later in the nineteenth century with the [[internal combustion engine]] and [[Electric power|electrical power generation]]. By 1920 innovator [[Henry Ford]], father of the [[assembly line]], stated, "There is but one rule for the industrialist, and that is: Make the highest quality goods possible at the lowest cost possible, paying the highest wages possible."

It has been argued that [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] per capita was much more stable and progressed at a much slower rate until the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern [[capitalist]] economy, and that it has since increased rapidly in capitalist countries.<ref>Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis [http://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/04-05/essay.cfm] Accessed 13 November 2006.</ref>

Some twentieth century historians such as [[John Clapham]] and [[Nicholas Crafts]] have argued that the process of economic and  social change took place gradually and the term revolution is not a true description of what took place. This is still a subject of debate amongst historians.<ref>[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0013-0117(199202)2%3A45%3A1%3C24%3ARTIR%3E2.0.CO%3B2-5  Rehabilitating the Industrial Revolution] Maxine Berg, Pat Hudson, Economic History Review, New Series, Vol. 45, No. 1 (Feb., 1992), pp. 24-50 doi:10.2307/2598327</ref><ref>[http://www.julielorenzen.net/berg.html Rehabilitating the Industrial Revolution] by Julie Lorenzen , Central Michigan University .

==Nomenclature==
The term ''Industrial Revolution'' applied to technological change was common in the 1830s. [[Louis-Auguste Blanqui]] in 1837 spoke of ''la r<U+00E9>volution industrielle''. [[Friedrich Engels]] in ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' spoke of "an industrial revolution, a revolution which at the same time changed the whole of civil society". 

In his book ''[[Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society]]'', [[Raymond Williams]] states in the entry for [[Industry]]: 
''The idea of a new social order based on major industrial change was clear in [[Robert Southey|Southey]] and [[Robert Owen|Owen]], between 1811 and 1818, and was implicit as early as [[William Blake|Blake]] in the early 1790s and [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] at the turn of the century.''

Credit for popularising the term may be given to [[Arnold Toynbee]], whose lectures given in 1881 gave a detailed account of the process.

==Causes==
The causes of the Industrial Revolution were complex and remain a topic for debate, with some historians seeing the Revolution as an outgrowth of social and institutional changes brought by the end of [[feudalism]] in Britain after the [[English Civil War]] in the 17th century. As national border controls became more effective, the spread of disease was lessened, therefore preventing the epidemics common in previous times. The percentage of children who lived past infancy rose significantly, leading to a larger workforce. The [[Enclosure]] movement and the [[British Agricultural Revolution]] made food production more efficient and less labour-intensive, forcing the surplus population who could no longer find employment in agriculture into [[cottage industry]], for example [[weaving]], and in the longer term into the cities and the newly-developed [[factories]]. The [[colonial expansion]] of the 17th century with the accompanying development of international trade, creation of [[financial markets]] and accumulation of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] are also cited as factors, as is the [[scientific revolution]] of the 17th century. 

[[Lewis Mumford]] has proposed that the Industrial Revolution had its origins in the early [[Middle Ages]], much earlier than most estimates. He explains that the model for standardized [[mass production]] was the [[printing press]] and that "the archetypal model for the [industrial era] was the clock". He also cites the [[monastic]] emphasis on order and time-keeping, as well as the fact that [[Medieval]] cities had at their center a church with bell ringing at regular intervals as being necessary precursors to a greater synchronization necessary for later, more physical manifestations such as the steam engine. 

Technological innovation protected by patents (by the [[Statute of Monopolies 1623]]) was also at the heart of it and the key enabling technology was the invention and improvement of the steam engine.<ref>Hudson, Pat. ''The Industrial Revolution'', Oxford University Press US. ISBN 0-7131-6531-6 [http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN0713165316&id=Bh7HVl92bVMC&pg=PA74&lpg=PA74&sig=IFA1UKF5OUj-wjGbeYaKoG0yDng Read it]</ref>

The presence of a large domestic market should also be considered an important driver of the Industrial Revolution, particularly explaining why it occurred in Britain. In other nations, such as France, markets were split up by local regions, which often imposed tolls and [[tariff]]s on goods traded amongst them.<ref>Deane, Phyliss. ''The First Industrial Revolution'', Cambridge University Press.

====Causes for occurrence in Europe====
{{seealso|China and the Industrial Revolution}}

One question of active interest to historians is why the Industrial Revolution started in 18th century Europe and not in other parts of the world in the 18th century, particularly [[China]] and [[India]], or at other times like in [[Aegyptus (Roman province)|Roman Egypt]], which had developed a primitive [[steam engine]]. <ref>[http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/archives/000891.html Why No Industrial Revolution in Ancient Greece? ] J. Bradford DeLong,  Professor of Economics, University of California at Berkeley , September 20, 2002. Accessed January 2007.</ref> <ref>[http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/lecture17a.html The Origins of the Industrial Revolution in England] | The History Guide , Steven Kreis, October 11, 2006 - Accessed January 2007</ref>Numerous factors have been suggested, including ecology, government, and culture. [[Benjamin Elman]] argues that China was in a [[high level equilibrium trap]] in which the non-industrial methods were efficient enough to prevent use of industrial methods with high costs of capital. [[Kenneth Pomeranz]], in the ''Great Divergence'', argues that Europe and China were remarkably similar in 1700, and that the crucial differences which created the Industrial Revolution in Europe were sources of coal near manufacturing centres, and raw materials such as food and wood from the New World, which allowed Europe to expand economically in a way that China could not.<ref>Immanuel Chung-Yueh Hsu. ''The Rise of Modern China'', Oxford University Press US. ISBN 0-19-512504-5 [http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN0195125045&id=cbzjtZUCtcAC&pg=PA106&lpg=PA106&sig=LxJLtypRU1TP4vGgtSJ-NV1eUFo Read it]</ref>

However, modern estimates of per capita income in Western Europe in the late 18th century are of roughly 1,500 dollars in purchasing power parity (and Britain had a per capita income of nearly 2,000 dollars <ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.iisg.nl/research/jvz-cobbdouglas.pdf Cobb-Douglas in pre-modern Europe1 - Simulating early modern growth]}} Jan Luiten van Zanden, International Institute of Social History/University of Utrecht. May 2005. Accessed January 2007 </ref> ) whereas China, by comparison, had only 450 dollars. Also, the average [[interest rate]] was about 5% in Britain and over 30% in China, which illustrates how capital was much more abundant in Britain; capital that was available for investment.

Some historians such as [[David Landes]] <ref>Landes, David (1999) ''Wealth And Poverty Of Nations'' pub WW Norton, ISBN 0393318885  </ref> and [[Max Weber]] credit the different belief systems in China and Europe with dictating where the revolution occurred. The religion and beliefs of Europe were largely products of [[Judaeo-Christianity]], and Greek thought. Conversely, Chinese society was founded on men like [[Confucius]], [[Mencius]], [[Han Feizi]] ([[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]]), [[Lao Tzu]] ([[Taoism]]), and [[Buddha]] ([[Buddhism]]). The key difference between these belief systems was that those from Europe focused on the individual, while Chinese beliefs centered around relationships between people. The family unit was more important than the individual for the large majority of Chinese history, and this may have played a role in why the Industrial Revolution took much longer to occur in China. There was the additional difference as to whether people looked backwards to a reputedly glorious past for answers to their questions or looked hopefully to the future. Furthermore, Western European peoples had experienced the [[Renaissance]] and [[Reformation]]; other parts of the world had not had a similar intellectual breakout, a condition that holds true even into the 21st century. 

In [[India]], the noted historian [[Rajni Palme Dutt]] <ref>South Asian History] -Pages from the history of the Indian subcontinent: British rule and the legacy of colonization Accessed January 2007</ref>[http://india_resource.tripod.com/colonial.html  has been quoted as saying, "The capital to finance the Industrial Revolution in India instead went into financing the Industrial Revolution in England." In direct contrast to China, India was split up into many different kingdoms all fighting for supremacy, with the three major ones being the [[Marathas]], [[Sikhs]] and the [[Mughals]]. In addition, the economy was highly dependent on two sectors&mdash;agriculture of subsistence and cotton, and technical innovation was non-existent. The vast amounts of wealth were stored away in palace treasuries, and as such, were easily moved to Britain.

====Causes for occurrence in Britain====
[[Image:Philipp Jakob Loutherbourg d. J. 002.jpg|thumb|330px|[[Coalbrookdale]] at night, 1801 :<br> Artist: [[Philip James de Loutherbourg|Philipp Jakob Loutherbourg the Younger]]]]

The debate about the start of the Industrial Revolution also concerns the massive lead that Britain had over other countries. Some have stressed the importance of natural or financial resources that Britain received from its many overseas [[British Empire#Colonization|colonies]] or that profits from the British [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] between Africa and the Caribbean helped fuel industrial investment. It has been pointed out however that slavery provided only 5% of the British national income during the years of the Industrial Revolution.<ref>http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/con_economic.cfm Was slavery the engine of economic growth? Digital History </ref>

Alternatively, the greater liberalisation of trade from a large merchant base may have allowed Britain to produce and utilise emerging scientific and technological developments more effectively than countries with stronger monarchies, particularly China and Russia. Britain emerged from the [[Napoleonic Wars]] as the only European nation not ravaged by financial plunder and economic collapse, and possessing the only merchant fleet of any useful size (European merchant fleets having been destroyed during the war by the [[Royal Navy]]<ref>The Royal Navy itself may have contributed to Britain<U+2019>s industrial growth. Among the first complex industrial manufacturing processes to arise in Britain were those that produced material for British warships. For instance, the average warship of the period used roughly 1000 pulley fittings. With a fleet as large as the Royal Navy, and with these fittings needing to be replaced ever 4 to 5 years, this created a great demand which encouraged industrial expansion. The industrial manufacture of rope can also be see as a similar factor.</ref>). Britain's extensive exporting cottage industries also ensured markets were already available for many early forms of manufactured goods. The conflict resulted in most British warfare being conducted overseas, reducing the devastating effects of territorial conquest that affected much of Europe. This was further aided by Britain's geographical position&mdash; an island separated from the rest of mainland Europe. 

Another theory is that Britain was able to succeed in the Industrial Revolution due to the availability of key resources it possessed. It had a dense population for its small geographical size. [[Enclosure]] of common land and the related [[British Agricultural Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] made a supply of this labour readily available. There was also a local coincidence of natural resources in the [[Northern England|North of England]], the English [[Midlands]], [[South Wales]] and the [[Scottish Lowlands]]. Local supplies of coal, iron, lead, copper, tin, limestone and water power, resulted in excellent conditions for the development and expansion of industry. Also, the damp, mild weather conditions of the North West of England provided ideal conditions for the spinning of cotton, providing a natural starting point for the birth of the textiles industry.

The stable political situation in Britain from around 1688, and British society's greater receptiveness to change (when compared with other European countries) can also be said to be factors favouring the Industrial Revolution.

====Protestant work ethic====
Another theory is that the British advance was due to the presence of an entrepreneurial class which believed in progress, technology and hard work.<sup>[[#Notes|1]]</sup> The existence of this class is often linked to the [[Protestant work ethic]] (see [[Max Weber]]) and the particular status of dissenting Protestant sects, such as the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], [[Baptists]] and [[Presbyterians]] that had flourished with the [[English Civil War]]. Reinforcement of confidence in the rule of law, which followed establishment of the prototype of constitutional monarchy in Britain in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, and the emergence of a stable financial market there based on the management of the [[national debt]] by the [[Bank of England]], contributed to the capacity for, and interest in, private financial investment in industrial ventures.

Dissenters found themselves barred or discouraged from almost all public offices, as well as education at England's only two Universities at the time (although dissenters were still free to study at Scotland's [[Ancient universities of Scotland|four universities]]). When the restoration of the monarchy took place and membership in the official [[Anglican church]] became mandatory due to the [[Test Act]], they thereupon became active in banking, manufacturing and education. The [[Unitarians]], in particular, were very involved in education, by running Dissenting Academies, where, in contrast to the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge and schools such as Eton and Harrow, much attention was given to mathematics and the sciences&mdash;areas of scholarship vital to the development of manufacturing technologies.

Historians sometimes consider this social factor to be extremely important, along with the nature of the national economies involved. While members of these sects were excluded from certain circles of the government, they were considered fellow Protestants, to a limited extent, by many in the [[middle class]], such as traditional financiers or other businessmen. Given this relative tolerance and the supply of capital, the natural outlet for the more enterprising members of these sects would be to seek new opportunities in the technologies created in the wake of the [[Scientific revolution]] of the 17th century.

====Lunar Society==== 
The work ethic argument has, on the whole, tended to neglect the fact that several inventors and entrepreneurs were rational free thinkers or "Philosophers" typical of a specific class of British intellectuals in the late 18th century, and were by no means normal church goers or members of religious sects. Examples of these free thinkers were the [[Lunar Society]] of [[Birmingham]] which flourished from 1765 to 1809. Its members were exceptional in that they were among the very few who were conscious that an industrial revolution was then taking place in Britain.<ref>[http://jquarter.members.beeb.net/morelunar.htm The Lunar Society] at Moreabout, the website of the ''Birmingham Jewellery Quarter'' guide, Bob Miles. "They were, if you like, the revolutionary committee of that most far reaching of all the eighteenth century revolutions, the Industrial Revolution." </ref> They actively worked as a group to encourage it, not least by investing in it and conducting scientific experiments which led to innovative products such as the invention of commercial gas lighting and turning the steam engine into the powerplant of the Industrial era.

==Innovations==
The invention of the steam engine was the most important innovation of the Industrial Revolution. [[James Watt]], later to be a member of the Lunar Society, developed the idea of using steam to power machines into a practicality thus enabling rapid development of efficient semi-automated factories on a previously unimaginable scale. This was applied to all aspects of industry and engineering. Earlier improvements in iron smelting and metal working based on the use of [[coke (fuel)|coke]] rather than charcoal allowed Watt and others before him to exploit the possibilities of using steam as a form of power. Earlier in the 18th century, the textile industry had harnessed water power to drive improved [[spinning jenny|spinning machines]] and [[flying shuttle|looms]]. These textile mills became the model for the organisation of human labour in factories, epitomised by [[Cottonopolis]], the name given to the vast collection of [[mill (grinding)|mill]]s, [[factories]] and administration offices based in [[Manchester]]. 

Besides the innovation of machinery in factories, the assembly line greatly improved efficiency. With a series of men trained to do a single task on a product, then having it moved along to the next worker, the number of finished goods also rose significantly.

===Transfer of knowledge===
Knowledge of new innovation was spread by several means. Workers who were trained in the technique might move to another employer or might be poached. A common method was for someone to make a study tour, gathering information where he could. During the whole of the Industrial Revolution and for the century before, all European countries and America engaged in study-touring; some nations, like [[Sweden]] and [[France]], even trained civil servants or technicians to undertake it as a matter of state policy. In other countries, notably Britain and America, this practice was carried out by individual manufacturers anxious to improve their own methods. Study tours were common then, as now, as was the keeping of travel diaries. Records made by industrialists and technicians of the period are an incomparable source of information about their methods.

Another means for the spread of innovation was by the network of informal philosophical societies&mdash;like the [[Lunar Society]] of Birmingham&mdash;in which members met to discuss science and often its application to manufacturing. Some of these societies published volumes of proceedings and transactions, and the London-based [[Royal Society of Arts]] published an illustrated volume of new inventions, as well as papers about them in its annual ''Transactions''.

There were publications describing technology. [[Encyclopedia]]s such as Harris's ''[[Lexicon technicum]]'' (1704) and Dr. Abraham Rees's ''[[Cyclopaedia]]'' (1802-1819) contain much of value. ''Cyclopaedia'' contains an enormous amount of information about the science and technology of the first half of the Industrial Revolution, very well illustrated by fine engravings. Foreign printed sources such as the ''[[Descriptions des Arts et M<U+00E9>tiers]]'' and Diderot's ''[[Encyclop<U+00E9>die]]'' explained foreign methods with fine engraved plates.

Periodical publications about manufacturing and technology began to appear in the last decade of the 18th century, and many regularly included notice of the latest patents. Foreign periodicals, such as the [[Annales des Mines]], published accounts of travels made by French engineers who observed British methods on study tours.

[[Samuel Slater]] (1768 <U+2013> 1835) is popularly known as the founder of the American cotton industry. As a boy apprentice in Derbyshire, England he learnt of the new techniques in the textile industry and defied laws against the emigration of skilled workers by leaving for New York in 1789, hoping to make money with his knowledge. Slater started [[Slater's mill]] at Pawtucket, Rhode Island, in 1793 and went on to own thirteen textile mills.<ref> Enclycop<U+00E6>dia Britannica (1998): ''Samuel Slater''</ref>

American [[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Francis Cabot Lowell]] of [[The Boston Associates]] went to England in 1810.  While there, he memorized the design of textile machines, and on his return to the United States, he set up the [[Boston Manufacturing Company]]. Lowell and his partners built America's first cotton-to-cloth textile mill.  After his death in 1817, his Associates built America's first planned factory town, which they named after him.  [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], utilizing miles of canals and the power of the [[Merrimack River]], is considered the 'Cradle of the American Industrial Revolution' and the short-lived utopia-like [[Lowell system|Lowell System]] was formed.

===Industry===
====Mining====
[[History of coal mining|Coal mining]] in Britain, particularly in [[Economy of Wales|South Wales]] started early. Before the steam engine, [[open-pit mine|pits]] were often shallow bell pits following a seam of coal along the surface which were abandoned as the coal was extracted. In other cases, if the geology was favourable, the coal was mined by means of an [[adit]] driven into the side of a hill. [[Shaft mining]] was done in some areas, but the limiting factor was the problem of removing water. It could be done by hauling buckets of water up the shaft or to a [[sough]] (a tunnel driven into a hill to drain a mine). In either case, the water had to be discharged into a stream or ditch at a level where it could flow away by gravity. The introduction of the steam engine greatly facilitated the removal of water and enabled shafts to be made deeper, enabling more coal to be extracted. These were developments that had begun before the Industrial Revolution, but the adoption of James Watt's more efficient steam engine from the 1770s reduced the fuel costs of engines, making mines more profitable.

====Metallurgy====
[[Image:Reverberatory_furnace_diagram.png|thumb|250px|right|Reverberatory Furnace]]

The major change in the metal industries during the era of the Industrial Revolution was the replacement of organic fuels based on [[wood]] with [[fossil fuel]] based on coal. Much of this happened somewhat before the Industrial Revolution, based on innovations by Sir [[Clement Clerke]] and others from 1678, using coal [[reverberatory furnace]]s known as cupolas. These were operated by the flames, which contained [[carbon monoxide]], playing on the [[ore]] and [[Redox|reducing]] the [[oxide]] to metal. This has the advantage that impurities (such as sulfur) in the coal do not migrate into the metal. This technology was applied to [[lead]] from 1678 and to [[copper]] from 1687. It was also applied to iron foundry work in the 1690s, but in this case the reverberatory furnace was known as an air furnace. The foundry cupola is a different (and later) innovation.  

This was followed by [[Abraham Darby I|Abraham Darby]], who made great strides using coke to fuel his [[blast furnace]]s at [[Coalbrookdale]] in 1709. However, the coke [[pig iron]] he made was used mostly for the production of cast iron goods such as pots and kettles. He had the advantage over his rivals in that his pots, cast by his patented process, were thinner and cheaper than theirs. Coke pig iron was hardly used to produce bar iron in forges until the mid 1750s, when his son [[Abraham Darby II]] built [[Horsehay]] and [[Ketley]] furnaces (not far from Coalbrookdale). By then, coke pig iron was cheaper than charcoal pig iron.  

[[Bar iron]] for smiths to forge into consumer goods was still made in [[finery forge]]s, as it long had been. However, new processes were adopted in the ensuing years. The first is referred to today as [[potting and stamping]], but this was superseded by [[Henry Cort]]'s [[Puddling furnace|puddling]] process. From 1785, perhaps because the improved version of potting and stamping was about to come out of patent, a great expansion in the output of the British iron industry began. The new processes did not depend on the use of [[charcoal]] at all and were therefore not limited by charcoal sources.  

Up to that time, British iron manufacturers had used considerable amounts of imported iron to supplement native supplies. This came principally from [[Sweden]] from the mid 17th century and later also from [[Russia]] from the end of the 1720s. However, from 1785, imports decreased because of the new iron making technology, and Britain became an exporter of bar iron as well as manufactured [[wrought iron]] [[consumer goods]]. 
 
Since iron was becoming cheaper and more plentiful, it also became a major structural material following the building of the innovative [[Iron Bridge]] in 1778 by [[Abraham Darby III]].
 
An improvement was made in the production of [[steel]], which was an expensive commodity and used only where iron would not do, such as for the cutting edge of tools and for springs.  [[Benjamin Huntsman]] developed his [[crucible steel]] technique in the 1740s. The raw material for this was blister steel, made by the [[cementation process]]. 

The supply of cheaper iron and steel aided the development of boilers and steam engines, and eventually railways. Improvements in [[machine tool]]s allowed better working of iron and steel and further boosted the industrial growth of Britain.

====Chemicals====
The large scale production of chemicals was an important development during the Industrial Revolution.  The first of these was the production of [[sulfuric acid]] by the [[lead chamber process]] invented by the Englishman [[John Roebuck]] (James Watt's first partner) in 1746.  He was able to greatly increase the scale of the manufacture by replacing the relatively expensive glass vessels formerly used with larger, less expensive chambers made of riveted sheets of lead.  Instead of a few pounds at a time, he was able to make a hundred pounds (45 kg) or so at a time in each of the chambers.  

The production of an [[alkali]] on a large scale became an important goal as well, and [[Nicolas Leblanc]] succeeded in 1791 in introducing a method for the production of [[sodium carbonate]]. The [[Leblanc process]] was a reaction of sulfuric acid with sodium chloride to give sodium sulfate and hydrochloric acid.  The sodium sulfate was heated with limestone (calcium carbonate) and coal to give a mixture of sodium carbonate and calcium sulfide.  Adding water separated the soluble sodium carbonate from the calcium sulfide.  The process produced a large amount of pollution (the hydrochloric acid was initially vented to the air, and calcium sulfide was a useless waste product). Nonetheless, this synthetic [[soda ash]] proved economical compared that produce from burning certain plants ([[barilla]]) or from [[kelp]], which were the previously dominant sources of soda ash,<ref name="Clow52"> Clow, Archibald and Clow, Nan L. (1952). ''Chemical Revolution,'' (Ayer Co Pub, June 1952), pp. 65-90. ISBN 0-8369-1909-2.</ref> and also to [[potash]] ([[potassium carbonate]]) derived from hardwood ashes.

These two chemicals were very important because they enabled the introduction of a host of other inventions, replacing many small-scale operations with more cost-effective and controllable processes.  Sodium carbonate had many uses in the glass, textile, soap, and paper industries.  Early uses for sulfuric acid included pickling (removing rust) iron and steel, and for [[bleach]]ing cloth.

The development of bleaching powder ([[calcium hypochlorite]]) by Scottish chemist [[Charles Tennant]] in about 1800, based on the discoveries of French chemist [[Claude Louis Berthollet]], revolutionized the bleaching processes in the textile industry by dramatically reducing the time required (from months to days) for the traditional process then in use, which required repeated exposure to the sun in bleach fields after soaking the textiles with alkali or sour milk.  Tennant's factory at St. Rollox, North [[Glasgow]], became the largest chemical plant in the world.

====Steam power====
{{main|Steam power during the Industrial Revolution}}
[[Image:Newcomens Dampfmaschine aus Meyers 1890.png|thumb|right|250px|Newcomen's atmospheric steam engine]]
The development of the [[stationary steam engine]] was an essential early element of the Industrial Revolution; however, for most of the period of the Industrial Revolution, the majority of industries still relied on wind and water power as well as horse and man-power for driving small machines. 

The industrial use of steam power started with [[Thomas Savery]] in 1698. He constructed and patented in London the first engine, which he called the "Miner's Friend" since he intended it to pump water from mines. This machine used steam at 8 to 10 atmospheres (120-150 [[Pound-force per square inch|psi]]) and did not use a piston and cylinder, but applied the steam pressure directly on to the surface of water in a cylinder to force it along an outlet pipe. It also used condensed steam to produce a partial vacuum to suck water into the cylinder. It generated about one [[horsepower]] (hp). It was used as a low-lift water pump in a few mines and numerous water works, but it was not a success since it was limited in the height it could raise water and was prone to boiler explosions.

The first successful machine was the [[atmospheric engine]], a low performance steam engine invented by [[Thomas Newcomen]] in 1712. Newcomen apparently conceived his machine quite independently of Savery. His engines used a piston and cylinder, and it operated with steam just above atmospheric pressure which was used to produce a partial vacuum in the cylinder when condensed by jets of cold water. The vacuum sucked a piston into the cylinder which moved under pressure from the atmosphere. The engine produced a succession of power strokes which could work a pump but could not drive a rotating wheel. They were successfully put to use for pumping out mines in Britain, with the engine on the surface working a pump at the bottom of the mine by a long connecting rod. These were large machines, requiring a lot of capital to build, but produced about 5 hp. They were inefficient, but when located where coal was cheap at pit heads, they were usefully employed in pumping water from mines. They opened up a great expansion in coal mining by allowing mines to go deeper. Despite using a lot of fuel, Newcomen engines continued to be used in the coalfields until the early decades of the nineteenth century because they were reliable and easy to maintain.

By 1729, when Newcomen died, his engines had spread to France, [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Hungary]] and [[Sweden]]. A total of 110 are known to have been built by 1733 when the patent expired, of which 14 were abroad. A total of 1,454 engines had been built by 1800.  <!--Rolt and Allen, p 145-->

Its working was fundamentally unchanged until James Watt succeeded in making his [[Watt steam engine]] in 1769, which incorporated a series of improvements, especially the separate steam condenser chamber. This improved engine efficiency by about a factor of five saving 75% on coal costs. The Watt steam engine's ability to drive rotary machinery also meant it could be used to drive a factory or mill directly. They were commercially very successful, and by 1800, the firm [[Boulton & Watt]] had constructed 496 engines, with 164 acting as pumps, 24 serving [[blast furnace]]s, and 308 to power mill machinery. Most of the engines generated between 5 to 10 hp.  

The development of [[machine tools]], such as the lathe, planing and shaping machines powered by these engines, enabled all the metal parts of the engines to be easily and accurately cut and in turn made it possible to build larger and more powerful engines.

Until about 1800, the most common pattern of steam engine was the [[beam engine]], which was built within a stone or brick engine-house, but around that time various patterns of portable (readily removable engines, but not on wheels) engines were developed, such as the [[table engine]]. 

[[Richard Trevithick]], a Cornish blacksmith, began to use high pressure steam with improved boilers in 1799. This allowed engines to be compact enough to be used on mobile road and rail [[locomotive]]s and [[steamboat|steam boats]].

In the early 19th century after the expiration of Watt's patent, the steam engine had many improvements by a host of inventors and engineers.

====Textile manufacture====
{{main|Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution}}
[[image:Spinning jenny.jpg|280px|thumb|left|Model of the spinning jenny in a museum in Wuppertal, Germany. The spinning jenny was one of the innovations that started the revolution.]]
In the early 18th century, British textile manufacture was based on [[wool]] which was processed by individual [[artisan]]s, doing the [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] and [[weaving]] on their own premises. This system is called a [[cottage industry]]. [[Flax]] and [[cotton]] were also used for fine materials, but the processing was difficult because of the pre-processing needed, and thus goods in these materials made only a small proportion of the output.

Use of the [[spinning wheel]] and [[loom|hand loom]] restricted the production capacity of the industry, but incremental advances increased productivity to the extent that manufactured cotton goods became the dominant British export by the early decades of the 19th century. [[India]] was displaced as the premier supplier of cotton goods.

[[Lewis Paul]] and John Wyatt of Birmingham patented the [[Roller Spinning machine]] and the [[flyer-and-bobbin]] system for drawing wool to a more even thickness. Paul and Wyatt opened a mill in Birmingham which used their new rolling machine powered by a [[donkey]]. In 1743, a factory was opened in [[Northampton]]; fifty spindles turned on five of Paul and Wyatt's machines proving more successful than their first Mill and operated until 1764. Lewis Paul also invented the hand driven [[carding]] machine. Using two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds, it was later used in the first cotton spinning [[cotton mill|mill]]. Lewis's invention was later developed and improved by [[Richard Arkwright]] and [[Samuel Crompton]], although this came about under great suspicion after a fire at [[Daniel Bourn]]'s factory in [[Leominster]] which specifically used Paul and Wyatt's spindles. Borne produced a similar patent in the same year. Other inventors increased the efficiency of the individual steps of spinning (carding, twisting and spinning, and rolling) so that the supply of [[yarn]] increased greatly, which fed a weaving industry that was advancing with improvements to [[Shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]]s and the loom or 'frame'. The output of an individual labourer increased dramatically, with the effect that the new machines were seen as a threat to employment, and early innovators were attacked and their inventions destroyed.

To capitalise upon these advances, it took a class of [[entrepreneur]]s, of which the most famous is [[Richard Arkwright]]. He is credited with a list of inventions, but these were actually developed by people such as [[Thomas Highs]] and [[John Kay (Spinning Frame)|John Kay]]; Arkwright nurtured the inventors, patented the ideas, financed the initiatives, and protected the machines. He created the [[cotton mill]] which brought the production processes together in a factory, and he developed the use of power &mdash; first [[horse power]], then [[water power]] and finally steam power &mdash; which made cotton manufacture a mechanized industry.

====Factories====
[[Image:Cottonopolis1.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Manchester, England ("[[Cottonopolis]]"), pictured in 1840, showing the mass of factory chimneys.]]

Industrialisation also led to the creation of the [[factory]]. [[John Lombe]]'s [[Derby Industrial Museum|water-powered silk mill]] at [[Derby]] was operational by 1721. In 1746, an integrated brass mill was working at [[Warmley]] near [[Bristol]]. Raw material went in at one end, was smelted into brass and was turned into pans, pins, wire, and other goods. Housing was provided for workers on site. 

[[Josiah Wedgwood]] and [[Matthew Boulton]] were other prominent early industrialists. 

The factory system was largely responsible for the rise of the modern [[city]], as workers migrated into the cities in search of employment in the factories. Nowhere was this better illustrated than the mills and associated industries of [[Manchester]], nicknamed [[Cottonopolis]], and arguably the world's first industrial city. For much of the 19th century, production was done in small mills, which were typically powered by water and built to serve local needs. Later each mill would have its own steam engine and a tall chimney to give an efficient draft through its boiler.

The transition to industrialisation was not wholly smooth. For example, a group of English workers known as [[Luddite]]s formed to protest against industrialisation and sometimes [[sabotage]]d factories.

One of the earliest reformers of factory conditions was [[Robert Owen]].

====Machine tools====
The Industrial Revolution could not have developed without [[machine tool]]s, for they enabled manufacturing machines to be made. They have their origins in the tools developed in the 18th century by makers of clocks and watches and scientific instrument makers to enable them to batch-produce small mechanisms. The mechanical parts of early textile machines were sometimes called 'clock work' because of the metal spindles and gears they incorporated. The manufacture of textile machines drew craftsmen from these trades and is the origin of the modern engineering industry. 

Machines were built by various craftsmen&mdash;[[carpenter]]s made wooden framings, and smiths and turners made metal parts. A good example of how machine tools changed manufacturing took place in Birmingham, England, in 1830. The invention of a new machine by [[William Joseph Gillott]], [[William Mitchell]] and [[James Stephen Perry]] allowed mass manufacture of robust, cheap steel pen nibs; the process had been laborious and expensive. Because of the difficulty of manipulating metal and the lack of machine tools, the use of metal was kept to a minimum. Wood framing had the disadvantage of changing dimensions with temperature and humidity, and the various joints tended to rack (work loose) over time. As the Industrial Revolution progressed, machines with metal frames became more common, but they required machine tools to make them economically. Before the advent of machine tools, metal was worked manually using the basic hand tools of hammers, files, scrapers, saws and chisels. Small metal parts were readily made by this means, but for large machine parts, production was very laborious and costly.

Apart from workshop lathes used by craftsmen, the first large machine tool was the cylinder [[boring machine]] used for boring the large-diameter cylinders on early steam engines. The [[planing machine]], the [[slotting machine]] and the [[shaping machine]] were developed in the first decades of the 19th century. Although the [[milling machine]] was invented at this time, it was not developed as a serious workshop tool until during the Second Industrial Revolution.

Military production had a hand in the development of machine tools. [[Henry Maudslay]], who trained a school of machine tool makers early in the 19th century, was employed at the [[Royal Arsenal]], [[Woolwich]], as a young man where he would have seen the large horse-driven wooden machines for [[cannon]] boring made and worked by the [[Verbruggans]]. He later worked for [[Joseph Bramah]] on the production of metal locks, and soon after he began working on his own. He was engaged to build the machinery for making ships' pulley blocks for the [[Royal Navy]] in the [[Portsmouth Block Mills]]. These were all metal and were the first machines for [[mass production]] and making components with a degree of [[interchangeability]]. The lessons Maudslay learned about the need for stability and precision he adapted to the development of machine tools, and in his workshops he trained a generation of men to build on his work, such as [[Richard Roberts (engineer)|Richard Roberts]], [[Joseph Clement]] and [[Joseph Whitworth]].

[[James Fox]] of [[Derby]] had a healthy export trade in machine tools for the first third of the century, as did [[Matthew Murray]] of Leeds. Roberts was a maker of high-quality machine tools and a pioneer of the use of jigs and gauges for precision workshop measurement.

====Gaslighting====
Another major industry of the later industrial revolution was [[Gas_lighting|gaslighting]]. It consisted of the large scale gasification of coal in furnaces, the purification of the gas (removal of sulphur, ammonium, and heavy hydrocarbons), and its storage and distribution. The first gaslighting utilities were established in London between 1812-1820. They soon became one of the major consumers of coal in the UK. Gaslighting had in impact on social and industrial organization because it allowed factories and stores to remain open longer than with tallow candles or oil. Its introduction allowed night life to flourish in cities and towns as interiors and street could be lighted on a larger scales than before.

===Transport===
{{main|Transport during the Industrial Revolution}}

At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, inland transport was by navigable rivers and roads, with coastal vessels employed to move heavy goods by sea. Railways or wagon ways were used for conveying coal to rivers for further shipment, but canals had not yet been constructed.  Animals supplied all of the motive power on land, with sails providing the motive power on the sea.

The Industrial Revolution improved Britain<U+2019>s transport infrastructure with a turnpike road network, a canal, and waterway network, and a railway network. Raw materials and finished products could be moved more quickly and cheaply than before. Improved transportation also allowed new ideas to spread quickly.

====Navigable rivers====
{{main|List of rivers of United Kingdom}}

All the major rivers of the United Kingdom were made more navigable during the Industrial Revolution. The [[Severn]], in particular, was used for the movement of goods to the Midlands which had been imported into Bristol from abroad, and for the export of goods from centres of production in [[Shropshire]] such as iron goods from [[Coalbrookdale]]. Transport was by way of [[trow]]s&mdash;small sailing vessels which could pass the various shallows and bridges in the river. The trows could navigate the Bristol Channel to the South Wales ports and Somerset ports, such as [[Bridgwater]] and even as far as France.

====Coastal sail====
Sailing vessels had long been used for moving goods round the British coast. The trade transporting coal to London from Newcastle had begun in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] times. The major international seaports such as London, Bristol, and Liverpool, were the means by which raw materials such as cotton might be imported and finished goods exported. Transporting goods onwards within Britain by sea was common during the whole of the Industrial Revolution and only fell away with the growth of the railways at the end of the period.

====Canals====
{{main|History of the British canal system}}

Canals began to be built in the late eighteenth century to link the major manufacturing centres in the Midlands and north with seaports and with London, at that time the largest manufacturing centre in the country. Canals were the first technology to allow bulk materials to be easily transported across country. A single canal horse could pull a load dozens of times larger than a cart at a faster pace. By the 1820s, a national network was in existence. Canal construction served as a model for the organisation and methods later used to construct the railways. They were eventually largely superseded as profitable commercial enterprises by the spread of the railways from the 1840s on.

Britain's canal network, together with its surviving mill buildings, is one of the most enduring features of the early Industrial Revolution to be seen in Britain.

====Roads====
Much of the original British road system was poorly maintained by thousands of local parishes, but from the 1720s (and occasionally earlier) [[turnpike]] trusts were set up to charge tolls and maintain some roads. Increasing numbers of main roads were turnpiked from the 1750s to the extent that almost every main road in England and Wales was the responsibility of some [[turnpike trust]]. New engineered roads were built by [[John Metcalf (Civil engineer)|John Metcalf]], [[Thomas Telford]] and [[John Loudon McAdam|John Macadam]]. The major turnpikes radiated from London and were the means by which the Royal Mail was able to reach the rest of the country. Heavy goods transport on these roads was by means of slow broad wheeled carts hauled by teams of horses. Lighter goods were conveyed by smaller carts or by teams of pack horses. Stage coaches transported rich people. The less wealthy walked or paid to ride on a carriers cart.

====Railways====
{{main|History of rail transport in Great Britain}}

Wagonways for moving coal in the mining areas had started in the 17th century and were often associated with canal or river systems for the further movement of coal. These were all horse drawn or relied on gravity, with a stationary steam engine to haul the wagons back to the top of the incline. The first applications of the steam [[locomotive]] were on wagon or plate ways (as they were then often called from the cast iron plates used). Horse-drawn public railways did not begin until the early years of the 19th century. Steam-hauled public railways began with the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway|Liverpool and Manchester]] and [[Stockton and Darlington]] Railways of the late 1820s. The construction of major railways connecting the larger cities and towns began in the 1830s but only gained momentum at the very end of the first Industrial Revolution.

After many of the workers had completed the railways, they did not return to their rural lifestyles but instead remained in the cities, providing additional workers for the factories.

Railways helped Britain's trade enormously, providing a quick and easy way of transport.

==Social effects==
In terms of social structure, the Industrial Revolution witnessed the triumph of a [[middle class]] of industrialists and businessmen over a landed class of nobility and gentry.

Ordinary working people found increased opportunities for employment in the new mills and factories, but these were often under strict working conditions with long hours of labour dominated by a pace set by machines. Harsh working conditions were prevalent long before the industrial revolution took place as well. Pre-industrial society was very static and often cruel&mdash;child labour, dirty living conditions and long working hours were just as prevalent before the Industrial Revolution.<ref>R.M. Hartwell, ''The Industrial Revolution and Economic Growth'', Methuen and Co., 1971, page 339-341 ISBN 0-416-19500-8</ref>

===Child labour===

The Industrial Revolution led to a population increase. Industrial workers were better paid than those in agriculture. With more money, women ate better, had healthier babies, who were themselves better fed. Death rates declined, and the distribution of age in the population became more youthful. There was limited opportunity for education, and children were expected to work. Employers also liked that they could pay a child less than an adult.

[[Child labour]] had existed before the Industrial Revolution, but with the increase in population and education it became more visible.  Before the passing of laws protecting children, many were forced to work in terrible conditions for much lower pay than their elders.[[Image:coaltub.gif|frame|A young "drawer" pulling a coal tub up a mine shaft.]]  Reports were written detailing some of the abuses, particularly in the coal mines[http://www.victorianweb.org/history/ashley.html] and textile factories[http://www.victorianweb.org/history/workers1.html] and these helped to popularize the children's plight.  The public outcry, especially among the upper and middle classes, helped stir change in the young workers' welfare.

Politicians and the government tried to limit child labour by law, but factory owners resisted; some felt that they were aiding the poor by giving their children money to buy food to avoid [[starvation]], and others simply welcomed the cheap labour. In 1833 and 1844, the first general laws against child labour, the [[Factory Acts]], were passed in England: Children younger than nine were not allowed to work, children were not permitted to work at night, and the work day of youth under the age of 18 was limited to twelve hours. Factory inspectors supervised the execution of the law. About ten years later, the employment of children and women in mining was forbidden. These laws decreased the number of child labourers; however, child labour remained in Europe up to the 20th century.

===Housing===
[[Image:Dore_London.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''Over London by Rail'' [[Gustave Dor<U+00E9>]] c 1870. Shows the densely populated and polluted environments created in the new industrial cities]]

Living conditions during the Industrial Revolution varied from the splendour of the homes of the owners to the squalor of the lives of the workers. [[Cliffe Castle]], [[Keighley]], is a good example of how the newly rich chose to live. This is a large home modelled loosely on a castle with towers and garden walls. The home is very large and was surrounded by a massive garden, the estate itself stretching for a number of miles. Cliffe Castle is now open to the public as a museum. 

Poor people lived in very small houses in cramped streets. These homes would share toilet facilities, have open sewers and would be at risk of [[damp]]. Conditions did improve during the 19th century as public health acts were introduced covering things such as sewage, hygiene and making some boundaries upon the construction of homes. Not everybody lived in homes like these. The Industrial Revolution created a larger middle class of professionals such as lawyers and doctors. The conditions for the poor improved over the course of the 19th century because of government and local plans which led to cities becoming cleaner places, but life had not been easy for the poor before industrialisation. However, as a result of the Revolution, huge numbers of the working class died due to disease spreading through the cramped living conditions. Chest diseases from the mines, [[cholera]] from polluted water and typhoid were also extremely common, as was smallpox. Accidents in factories with child and female workers were regular. [[Charles Dickens|Dickens']] novels perhaps best illustrate this - even some government officials were horrified by what they saw. Strikes and riots by workers were also relatively common. [http://www.towns-online.co.uk/index.php?id=3861]

===Luddites===
{{main|Luddite}}
The rapid industrialisation of the English economy cost many craft workers their jobs. The textile industry in particular industrialized early, and many weavers found themselves suddenly unemployed since they could no longer compete with machines which only required relatively limited (and unskilled) labour to produce more cloth than a single weaver. Many such unemployed workers, weavers and others, turned their animosity towards the machines that had taken their jobs and began destroying factories and machinery. These attackers became known as Luddites, supposedly followers of [[Ned Ludd]], a folklore figure. The first attacks of the Luddite movement began in 1811. The Luddites rapidly gained popularity, and the British government had to take drastic measures to protect industry.

===Organisation of labour===
<!-- NOTE This article uses British English spelling -->
:''See also [[Trade union#History|Labor history]]''

The Industrial Revolution concentrated labour into mills, factories and mines, thus facilitating the organisation of [[trade union]]s to help advance the interests of working people. The power of a union could demand better terms by withdrawing all labour and causing a consequent cessation of production. Employers had to decide between giving in to the union demands at a cost to themselves or suffer the cost of the lost production. Skilled workers were hard to replace, and these were the first groups to successfully advance their conditions through this kind of bargaining.

The main method the unions used to effect change was [[strike action]]. Strikes were painful events for both sides, the unions and the management. In England, the [[Combination Laws|Combination Act]] forbade workers to form any kind of trade union from 1799 until its repeal in 1824. Even after this, unions were still severely restricted. 

In 1842, a [[General Strike]] involving cotton workers and colliers and organised through the [[Chartist]] movement stopped production across Great Britain.<ref> [http://www.chartists.net/General-Strike-1842 General Strike 1842] From chartists.net , Accessed 13 November 2006.</ref>

[[Image:Global Carbon Emission by Type.png|right|thumb|300px|Roughly exponential increase in carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels, driven by increasing energy demands since the Industrial Revolution (See [[global warming]])]]

The application of steam power to the industrial processes of [[printing]] supported a massive expansion of newspaper and popular book publishing, which reinforced rising literacy and demands for mass political participation. 

During the Industrial Revolution, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically. The percentage of the children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5% in 1730 - 1749 to 31.8% in 1810 - 1829.<ref>Mabel C. Buer, ''Health, Wealth and Population in the Early Days of the Industrial Revolution'', London: George Routledge & Sons, 1926, page 30 ISBN 0-415-38218-1</ref> Besides, there was a significant increase in worker wages during the period 1813-1913.<ref>[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6WFJ-45P12GW-G/2/62dcd3171db7429a2e87513a84f4374a ScienceDirect - Explorations in Economic History: Trends in Real Wages in Britain, 1750-1913] from www.sciencedirect.com, downloaded 17 July 2006.</ref><ref>[http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/IndustrialRevolutionandtheStandardofLiving.html Industrial Revolution and the Standard of Living] From www.econlib.org, downloaded 17 July 2006.</ref><ref>R.M.

==Intellectual paradigms==
===Capitalism===
{{main|Capitalism}}
The advent of [[The Enlightenment]] provided an intellectual framework which welcomed the practical application of the growing body of scientific knowledge &mdash; a factor evidenced in the systematic development of the steam engine, guided by scientific analysis, and the development of the political and [[sociology|sociological]] analyses, culminating in [[Adam Smith]]'s [[The Wealth of Nations]]. One of the main arguments for capitalism is that industrialisation have increased wealth for all, as evidenced by raising life expectancy, reduced working hours, and no work for children and the elderly.

==Criticism==
===Marxism===
{{main|Marxism}}
Marxism is esentially a reaction to the Industrial Revolution.<ref>[http://www.mises.org/journals/rae/pdf/rae4_1_5.pdf Karl Marx: Communist as Religious Eschatologist]</ref> According to [[Karl Marx]], industrialisation polarised society into the [[bourgeoisie]] (those who own the [[means of production]], the factories and the land) and the much larger [[proletariat]] (the working class who actually perform the [[labour (economics)|labour]] necessary to extract something valuable from the means of production). He saw the industrialisation process as the logical [[dialectics|dialectical]] progression of feudal economic modes, necessary for the full development of capitalism, which he saw as in itself a necessary precursor to the development of [[socialism]] and eventually [[communism]].

===Romantic Movement===
{{main|Romanticism}}

Concurrent with the Industrial Revolution there developed an intellectual and artistic hostility towards the new industrialisation known as the Romantic Movement. Its major exponents in English included the artist and poet [[William Blake]] and poets [[William Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[John Keats]],  [[Byron]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]. The movement stressed the importance of "nature" in art and language, in contrast to the 'monstrous' machines and factories. In Blake's words they were the, "''Dark satanic mills''" of his poem ''[[And did those feet in ancient time]]''. [[Mary Shelley]]'s short story ''[[Frankenstein]]'' reflected a concern about the possibly two-edged nature of scientific progress.

==Second Industrial Revolution==
{{main|Second Industrial Revolution}}

The insatiable demand of the railways for more durable rail led to the development of the means to cheaply mass-produce steel. Steel is often cited as the first of several new areas for industrial mass-production, which are said to characterize a "Second Industrial Revolution", beginning around 1850. This second Industrial Revolution gradually grew to include the [[chemical industry|chemical industries]], [[petroleum]] refining and distribution, [[electrical industry|electrical industries]], and, in the twentieth century, the [[automotive industry|automotive industries]], and was marked by a transition of technological leadership from Britain to the [[United States]] and Germany.

The introduction of [[hydroelectric power]] generation in the [[Alps]] enabled the rapid industrialisation of coal-deprived northern [[Italy]], beginning in the 1890s. The increasing availability of economical petroleum products also reduced the importance of coal and further widened the potential for industrialisation.

By the 1890s, industrialisation in these areas had created the first giant industrial corporations with burgeoning global interests, as companies like [[United States Steel Corporation|U.S. Steel]], [[General Electric]], and [[Bayer|Bayer AG]] joined the railroad companies on the world's [[stock market]]s.
