'''''ToeJam & Earl''''' is an [[action game]] developed by [[Johnson Voorsanger Productions]] and published by [[Sega]] for the [[Mega Drive]]. Released in 1991, it centers on the titular ToeJam and Earl<U+2014>extraterrestrials who have crash-landed on Earth<U+2014>as they attempt to escape the planet. Players assume the role of either character and collect pieces of their wrecked spacecraft. ''ToeJam & Earl'''s design was heavily influenced by the [[computer role-playing game]] ''[[Rogue (computer game)|Rogue]]'', and took from it such features as the random generation of levels and items. It references and parodies 1990s urban culture and is set to a [[Funk (music)|funk]] soundtrack.

The game was positively received by critics, who praised its originality, soundtrack, humor and two-player cooperative mode. It attained [[sleeper hit]] status despite low initial sales, and its protagonists were used as mascots by Sega. ''ToeJam & Earl'' was followed by two sequels: ''[[ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron]]'' and ''[[ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to Earth]]'', released for the Mega Drive and [[Xbox]], respectively. The sequels' commercial and critical success was mixed; research has suggested that series fans favor the original ''ToeJam & Earl''. The game again received positive reviews in 2006 when re-released for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]], but certain critics believed that it had become dated.

==Synopsis==

''ToeJam & Earl'' has been called a [[Surreal humour|surreal]], comic [[satire]],<ref name="funkotronics"/> and a "daringly [[misanthropic]] commentary on Earthly life".<ref name="citypages"/> The game's protagonists, ToeJam and Earl, have been described as a "three-legged red alien" and "fat orange alien", respectively.<ref name="eurogamer">Kristan Reed, [http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/virtual-console-sega-mega-drive-review?page=2 Virtual Console: SEGA Mega Drive], [[EuroGamer]], Jan 23, 2007, Accessed Apr 8, 2009</ref> ToeJam wears a large gold medallion and a backwards baseball cap, while Earl is marked by [[high-top]]s and oversized sunglasses; both outfits are "over-the-top appropriations" of 1990s urban culture.<ref name="funkotronics"/> Their speech features Californian slang.<ref name="mm"/> The game is set to a soundtrack which has been described both as [[jazz-funk]],<ref name="funkotronics"/> and as [[Hip hop music|rap]].<ref name="newstribune"/>

In the game's opening sequence, ToeJam explains that Earl's erratic piloting abilities have resulted in a crash-landing on Earth. He says that they must find the pieces of their [[spacecraft]]'s wreckage to return to their home planet, Funkotron.<ref>ToeJam: "We were cruisin' in our rocket, thumpin' out a funky beat, when big Earl said he'd like a shot in the driver's seat... You should never let Earl drive. Yo, so here we are, chillin' out on the most insane planet in the galaxy, Planet Earth! Thanks to Earl... All we have to do now, is find the 10 pieces of our rocketship and we can jet outta here. No problem."</ref> The player guides the characters as they avoid Earth's antagonistic inhabitants and search for the debris.<ref name="funkotronics"/> Should the player succeed, the final sequence depicts ToeJam and Earl escaping the planet in their reconstructed spacecraft. Under the player's control, the characters proceed across a purple landscape that represents Funkotron, and are greeted by their friends and family.<ref>''ToeJam & Earl'', Sega, 1991</ref>

==Gameplay==

The two aliens are separated by a purple line that runs horizontally through the image.|ToeJam (above) and Earl (below) explore floating islands which represent Earth, while avoiding "Earthlings" such as the devil seen on the top screen.]] 
''ToeJam & Earl'' takes place from a top-down perspective in a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] game world. Its gameplay mechanics were inspired by ''[[Rogue (computer game)|Rogue]]'', which has led to its description as a [[Roguelike]] or [[dungeon-crawl]] game.<ref name="gamespot"/><ref name="gamedesign"/> The game contains both single-player and two-player cooperative modes. The latter displays a single screen when both characters are near each other, but splits it apart when they are not.<ref name="funkotronics"/> Playing the game with two players reveals dialogue and jokes between the characters not heard in the single player game.<ref name="funkotronics"/><ref name="mm"/>

The game is set on Earth, which is represented by randomly-generated islands that float in space,<ref name=gamespot /> each one a layer above the last. They are connected by elevators. Some islands contain pieces of spacecraft wreckage, of which the player must collect 10 to win the game.<ref name="funkotronics"/> The [[player character]] drops to the island below if he falls from an island's edge, which necessitates that the player again locate an elevator.<ref name="mm">Julian Rignall & Edward "Rad" Laurence, "Mega Drive Review: ToeJam & Earl", ''[[Mean Machines]]'', Nov 1991 (issue 14), pp. 106<U+2013>08</ref> Each island is populated by antagonistic "Earthlings", such as phantom ice-cream trucks, aggressive packs of "[[nerds]]", giant hamsters, [[Bogeymen]], man-eating mailboxes, and police chickens.<ref name="funkotronics"/><ref>[http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmtv/features/alienguide/tjande.asp UGO's Guide to the Galaxy], [[UGO]], Accessed Apr 8, 2009</ref><ref name="mm"/> Certain Earthlings aid the player.<ref name="funkotronics"/> The game has been described as "largely non-violent",<ref name="1up"/> as the protagonists can only attack enemies with thrown tomatoes<U+2014>one of many temporary, randomly-generated [[power-up]]s.<ref name="funkotronics"/>

Power-ups are contained in wrapped presents,<ref name="gamespot">Jeff Gerstmann, [http://uk.gamespot.com/wii/action/toejamearl/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;read-review ToeJam & Earl Review], [[GameSpot]], Jan 23, 2007, Accessed Apr 8, 2009</ref> which are categorized by appearance. The contents of a present are invisible to the player until it is opened; afterwards, all presents of that appearance are identified. Identification of presents' contents is a central gameplay mechanic.<ref name="gamespot"/><ref name="gamedesign">John Harris, [http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3485/game_design_essentials_20_.php?page=12 Game Design Essentials: 20 Mysterious Games], [[Gamasutra]], Jan 14, 2008, Accessed Apr 8, 2009</ref> Each power-up has a unique effect: while one might increase the [[player character]]s' running speed, another distracts enemies.<ref name="mm"/><ref name="gamespot"/> Certain presents contain harmful power-ups, such the loss of a "life", or the "randomizer", which hides the identity of all presents. In the game's cooperative mode, if one player character opens a present in the vicinity of the other, its contents affect both characters.<ref name="gamedesign"/> As players open more presents, the chances of accidentally opening the randomizer are increased, which prevents the game from becoming easier as more presents are identified.<ref name="gamedesign"/>

==Development==
''ToeJam & Earl'' creator Greg Johnson became a fan of ''Rogue'' as a university student. After he left university, he worked on games for [[Electronic Arts]], including ''[[Starflight]]'' (1986).<ref name="gamasutrainterview"/> After the completion of ''[[Starflight 2]]'', Johnson conceived ''ToeJam & Earl''<U+2014>first the characters, then the plot<U+2014>while on a beach in Hawaii.<ref name="jamminout">"Jammin' Out With Greg Johnson and Mark Voorsanger", ''[[Sega Visions]]'', May/June 1992, pp. 38<U+2013>39</ref> The idea was a combination of ''Rogue'''s gameplay concepts and a lighter version of ''Starflight's'' science-fiction themes.<ref name="funkotronics"/><ref name="gamasutrainterview"/> Johnson met programmer Mark Voorsanger through a mutual friend, while walking on [[Mount Tam]] in 1989. He related the concept of ''ToeJam & Earl'' to Voorsanger, and the two resolved to make the game together. They formed Johnson Voorsanger Productions, and serious work on the game began soon after.<ref name="gamasutrainterview">Alistair Wallis, [http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11707 Playing Catch Up: ToeJam & Earl's Greg Johnson], [[Gamasutra]], Nov 16, 2006, Accessed Apr 6, 2009</ref> Their status as commercial game designers allowed them to meet with Sega of America, and they used cards covered in landscape drawings to demonstrate their idea of randomly generated levels.<ref name="gamasutrainterview"/> Sega marketing manager Hugh Bowen was immediately interested in the concept; Sega wanted innovative games and new mascots to compete with [[Nintendo]].<ref name="gamasutrainterview"/><ref name="funkotronics">Travis Fahs, [http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/945/945419p1.html Funkotronics 101], [[IGN]], Jan 15, 2009, Accessed Apr 6, 2009</ref> 

The game's small development team was comprised of Johnson's previous colleagues,<ref name="funkotronics"/> and its music was composed by John Baker. The team's goal was to make a humorous game that was "original, easy to understand and offered an immediate response to the player's actions". The designers wanted to include a two-player mode so that they could play together, and considered ''ToeJam & Earl'' "a two player game with a one player option."<ref name="jamminout"/> While Sega believed that hardware issues would prevent the feature from working, Voorsanger successfully implemented it.<ref name="gamasutrainterview"/> In a 1992 interview with ''[[Sega Visions]]'', Johnson stated that the characters ToeJam and Earl evolved as reflections of his and Voorsanger's personalities. Voorsanger disagreed, and called the characters "two different aspects of Greg's personality".<ref name="jamminout"/> [[Steve Purcell]] has stated that he contributed character designs to the game.<ref>Frank Cifaldi & Simon Carless, [http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=6021 Playing Catch-Up: Steve Purcell], [[Gamasutra]], July 25, 2005, Accessed Apr 6, 2009</ref>

==Reception==
''ToeJam & Earl'' received positive reviews,<ref name="gamasutrainterview"/> which Bill Paris of [[UGO]] described as "almost unanimous critical acclaim".<ref name="paris">Bill Paris, [http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=1851 Funkotronic Alien Invasion?!], [[UGO]], Accessed Apr 10, 2009</ref> However, Sega deemed it a commercial failure due to low initial sales. The game built a cult following through [[word of mouth]],<ref name="gamasutrainterview"/> and it was further aided by the Mega Drive's Christmas 1991 sales spike, caused by the release of ''Sonic the Hedgehog''.<ref name="funkotronics"/> ''ToeJam & Earl'' was later considered a "cult" success.<ref name="gamasutrainterview"/> 

''[[Mean Machines]]'' found the game addictive and original, but found fault with its slow-paced combat.<ref name="mm"/> One of the reviewers said, "Not everyone will like it<U+2014>it's not normal enough for mass appeal<U+2014>but I think it's destined to become a massive cult classic".<ref name="mm"/> ''[[GamePro]]'' called the game's originality "incredible", and praised its graphics, music and humor.<ref>"Genesis Pro Review: ToeJam & Earl", ''[[GamePro]]'', 16 Bit Buyer's Guide February 1992, pp. 56<U+2013>57</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised the "absolutely hilarious" sound effects and music.<ref>Bob Strauss, [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,316297,00.html Is 'Zap' All There Is?], ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Nov 22, 1991, Accessed Apr 14, 2009</ref> Jeff Csatari of ''[[Boys' Life]]'' called it a "another hot game" for the Mega Drive, alongside ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''.<ref>Jeff Csatari, "New Video Games", ''[[Boys' Life]]'', Dec 1991, p. 44</ref> Ed Martinez of ''[[Game Informer]]'' commended the game's soundtrack and unique concept, but found it to be too easy.<ref>Ed Martinez, "Sega's ToeJam & Earl 'Yo! What's up?'", ''[[Game Informer]]'', Nov/Dec 1991 (issue 2), p. 4</ref> A review published in both the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[Rome News-Tribune]]'' likened ''ToeJam and Earl'' to "an outer-space, rap version of [[Abbott and Costello]]". The reviewers called it "the funniest game we've seen in a long time", and praised its soundtrack, graphics and action.<ref name="newstribune">Chip & Jonathan Carter, "Inside the Video Games", ''[[Rome News-Tribune]]'', Dec 17, 1991, Young Romans Supplement p. 5</ref><ref>Chip & Jonathan Carter, "2 of the best and the brightest, just in time for Christmas", ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Dec 20, 1991, p. 62</ref> ''[[The Toronto Star]]'' acclaimed the game's "hilariously designed split-screen two-player mode", and said, "If you've got a Sega-Genesis system, you simply must check out [this] awesome rap 'n' roll game".<ref>Kym Adams, "Video Games", ''[[The Toronto Star]]'', Dec 28, 1991, p. V6</ref> ''[[Sega Visions]]'' praised the game's "no-repetitive action" and said, "This is the zaniest game that ever rocked Sega's Genesis system."<ref>"ToeJam & Earl", ''[[Sega Visions]]'', Summer 1991 (issue 5), p. 18</ref> Several months after the game's release, ''[[Mega (magazine)|Mega]]'' ranked it the 13th best Mega Drive game in its All-Time Top 100 feature. The magazine praised the game's "superbly manic and zany action", and deemed it both "original and insane".<ref>Stuart Campbell, "Mega All-Time Top 100", ''[[Mega (magazine)|Mega]]'', July 1992</ref>

''ToeJam & Earl'' was re-released on the Nintendo [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] in 2006.<ref name="gamespot"/> ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' scored the game 85%, and praised its humor, originality and two-player mode. However, the reviewer believed that the game's enjoyability had diminished with time.<ref>"Wii Shop Rated", ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'', Sept 2008 (issue 33), p. 129</ref> [[GameSpot]] felt that the game's 1990s idioms were dated, but that the gameplay<U+2014>particularly the two-player mode<U+2014>was still enjoyable by modern standards.<ref name="gamespot"/> Jeremy Parish of [[1UP.com|1UP]] found the the game's two-player co-operative mode more enjoyable than its single-player, and described the graphics and sound as "oddly primitive". Parish considered it "one of the best games to hit VC to date".<ref name="1up">Jeremy Parish, [http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3156110 Retro Roundup: Saturnalia Edition], [[1UP]], Dec 29, 2006, Accessed Apr 13, 2009</ref> [[Eurogamer]]'s reviewer negatively received the game, and believed its gameplay to be unsatisfying and overly slow.<ref name="eurogamer"/> [[IGN]] called the game's visuals a "mixed bag" and derided the slow pace, but praised its unpredictability and believed that its sound design was "one thing you absolutely can't fault".<ref name="ignvc">Lucas M. Thomas, [http://uk.wii.ign.com/articles/758/758084p1.html ToeJam & Earl VC Review], [[IGN]], Jan 24, 2007, Accessed Apr 14, 2009</ref>

==Legacy==

ToeJam and Earl became "one of Sega's second tier mascots, alongside Sonic",<ref>Chris Johnston, [http://uk.gamespot.com/news/2451718.html?tag=result;title;9 Too Much Funk for GT], [[GameSpot]],  Apr 23, 1999, Accessed Apr 13, 2009</ref> and one of the Mega Drive's "key exclusive franchises".<ref>Staff, [http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/949/949101p1.html The Wednesday 10: Ill-Fated Franchise Reboots], [[IGN]], Jan 28, 2009, Accessed Apr 13, 2009</ref> The characters appeared in a spin-off [[light gun game]], ''Ready, Aim, Tomatoes'', developed by Johnson Voorsanger Productions as one of six [[mini-game]]s for the [[Menacer 6-game cartridge]].<ref name="funkotronics"/> In early 1992, the developers began work on a sequel to ''ToeJam & Earl'', and spent three months expanding on the original game's concept by adding indoor areas and more terrain types.<ref name="funkotronics"/> Sega was not impressed by the sequel, and believed it to be unmarketable. The team redesigned it as a [[platform game]], as Sega was inclined to publish games in this genre.<ref name="funkotronics"/><ref name="gamasutrainterview"/> The game, entitled ''[[ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron]]'', was highly anticipated, and was a commercial and critical success when it released in 1993. However, fans of the original game were disappointed by the change in design to a perceived generic style.<ref name="funkotronics"/> Due to poor North American sales of the [[Sega Saturn]], Sega's next generation video game console, the ''ToeJam & Earl'' franchise was neglected. A ''ToeJam & Earl'' game planned for the [[Nintendo 64]] was cancelled, but a third installment, ''[[ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to Earth]]'', was released for the Xbox in 2002. The release returned to the concepts of the original game, but generated mixed reviews and poor sales.<ref name="funkotronics"/><ref name="gamasutrainterview"/>

''ToeJam & Earl'' has been called "weird",<ref name="gamespot"/> "strange",<ref name="mm"/><ref name="1up"/> and "thoroughly odd".<ref name="eurogamer"/> Critics have difficulty in determining a genre for the game;<ref name="funkotronics"/> it has been called a platform game and Roguelike,<ref name="mm"/><ref name="gamedesign"/> as well as action and [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]].<ref name="gamespot"/><ref name="ignvc"/> While ''ToeJam & Earl''{{'}}s success did not match that of the Mega Drive's other popular titles, it has been considered a "classic",<ref name="gamespot"/><ref name="citypages">David Hansen, [http://blogs.citypages.com/gimmenoise/2009/04/unsung_heroes_t.php Unsung Heroes: ToeJam and Earl], ''[[Minneapolis City Pages]]'', Apr 7, 2009, Accessed Apr 14, 2009</ref> and a "cult" game.<ref name="gamasutrainterview"/><ref name="paris"/> Prior ''ToeJam & Earl III'''s conception, research by its developers found that the original ''ToeJam & Earl'' was preferred over its sequel.<ref>Sam Kennedy, [http://uk.gamespot.com/news/2460613.html?tag=result;title;4 ToeJam & Earl Go PlayStation 2], [[GameSpot]], June 2, 1999, Accessed Apr 14, 2009</ref> In an [[IGN]] survey, 65% of respondents cited it as their favorite of the three games.<ref>Levi Buchanan, [http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/946/946315p1.html ToeJam & Earl Favorites], [[IGN]], Jan 20, 2009, Accessed Apr 14, 2009</ref>
