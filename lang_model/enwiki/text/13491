'''George Keble Hirst''', [[M.D.]] (March 2, 1909 <U+2013> January 22, 1994<ref>[http://www.death-record.com/l/100999306/George-K-Hirst Death Record: George K. Hirst] (accessed 21 February 2013)</ref>) was an American [[virologist]] and science administrator who was among the first to study the [[molecular biology]] and [[genetics]] of [[animal virus]]es, especially [[influenza virus]]. He is particularly known for inventing the [[hemagglutination assay]], a simple method for [[virus quantification|quantifying viruses]], and adapting it into the hemagglutination inhibition assay, which measures virus-specific [[antibody|antibodies]] in serum. He was the first to discover that [[virus]]es can contain [[enzyme]]s, and the first to propose that virus [[genome]]s can consist of discontinuous segments. ''[[The New York Times]]'' described him as "a pioneer in molecular virology."<ref name=NYT />

Hirst directed the [[Public Health Research Institute]] in [[New York City]] (1956<U+2013>1981), and was also the founding editor-in-chief of ''[[Virology (journal)|Virology]]'', the first English-language journal to focus on [[virus]]es.

==Education and career==
Hirst was born in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin|Eau Claire]], [[Wisconsin]], USA, but his family soon moved to [[Lewistown, Montana|Lewistown]], [[Montana]]. He studied at [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Hobart College]] in [[Geneva, New York|Geneva]], [[New York]] and later at [[Yale University]], [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]], from which he gained his first degree and medical degree (1933).<ref name=NYT /><ref name=Schlesinger>[[R.

Hirst (1909<U+2013>1994)" ''[[Virology (journal)|Virology]]'' 200: 327</ref> He worked at the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research]] in [[New York City]] in 1936<U+2013>1940, under the supervision of [[Homer Swift]] and [[Rebecca Lancefield]], and then moved to the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]'s International Health Division laboratories in 1940.<ref name=NYT /><ref name=Schlesinger /> There he combined research in collaboration with [[Frank Horsfall]], [[Edwin D. Kilbourne]] and others with his army service, as a member of the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board's Commission on Influenza.<ref name=NYT /><ref name=AFEB>[http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/historiesofcomsn/section2.html US Army Medical Department: Office of Medical History: Commission on Influenza] (accessed 21 February 2013)</ref>

After the [[Second World War]], Hirst joined the [[Public Health Research Institute]] in New York City, which had been established in 1942, where he remained until his retirement in 1983. He became head of the Infectious Diseases and Virology Divisions, and in 1956 succeeded [[Lemuel Whittington Gorham|L. Whittington Gorham]] as director of the institute, a position he held for nearly 25 years until 1981. During his tenure, he superintended its expansion and move to a new location on 26th Street and First Avenue.<ref name=NYT>[http://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/26/obituaries/george-keble-hirst-84-is-dead-a-pioneer-in-molecular-virology.html George Keble Hirst, 84, is dead; a pioneer in molecular virology.

==Research==
[[File:H1N1 navbox.jpg|left|thumb|[[Influenza virus]], the focus of much of Hirst's research]]
Hirst's earliest research, in the 1930s, was on [[bacteria]], including [[pneumococci]] and [[streptococci]], in collaboration with Lancefield and others.<ref>[http://yufind.library.yale.edu/yufind/Record/1870057 Yale University Library Host sensitivity to pneumococcus products ...] (accessed 18 January 2013)</ref><ref>[[Maclyn McCarty|McCarty M]].

===Hemagglutination===
In 1941, Hirst discovered that adding influenza virus particles to [[red blood cell]]s caused them to [[agglutination (biology)|agglutinate]] or stick together forming a lattice, a phenomenon called [[hemagglutination]].<ref name=NYT /><ref name=Schlesinger /> Hemagglutination provided a convenient method of [[diagnosis|diagnosing]] influenza in the laboratory, which had previously been performed by cultivating the virus in ferrets.<ref name=AFEB /> Hirst developed this reaction into the [[hemagglutination assay]], which allows the amount of virus in the sample to be measured.<ref name=NYT /><ref name=Schlesinger /> This technique is rapid, accurate and convenient, and later proved to be applicable to many other viruses.<ref name=Joklik>[[Wolfgang Joklik|Joklik WK]].

===Hemagglutination inhibition and vaccination===
[[File:Flu und legende color c.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Diagram of influenza virus, showing the [[hemagglutinin (influenza)|hemagglutinin]] (HA) and [[viral neuraminidase|neuraminidase]] (NA)]]
He soon realised that the hemagglutination assay could easily be adapted to measure the levels of [[antibody]] specific to the virus strain in human serum: any antibodies present bind to the influenza virus particles, prevent them from crosslinking red blood cells and so inhibit hemagglutination.<ref name=NYT /><ref name=Schlesinger /><ref name=Racaniello /> This hemagglutination inhibition assay (HIA) can be applied to many other viruses carrying a [[hemagglutinin]] molecule, including [[rubella virus|rubella]], [[measles]], mumps, [[parainfluenza virus|parainfluenza]], [[Adenoviridae|adenoviruses]], [[Polyomaviridae|polyomaviruses]] and [[arbovirus]]es, and is still widely used in influenza [[disease surveillance|surveillance]] and [[influenza vaccine|vaccine]] testing.<ref>Specter ''et al''., p. 259</ref><ref>[http://www.influenzareagentresource.org/Portals/6/PDFS/WHO%20Insert%202011-2012.pdf WHO Collaborating Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology and Control of Influenza: The 2011<U+2013>2012 WHO influenza reagent kit for identification of influenza isolates] (accessed 21 February 2013)</ref><ref>Katz JM, Hancock K, Xu X.

HIA is "a powerful epidemiological tool," according to virologist [[Vincent Racaniello]],<ref name=Racaniello /> and Hirst explored its application to [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies.<ref name=Schlesinger /> He was one of several researchers who developed and trialed inactivated influenza vaccines in the mid-1940s, and he applied HIA to the study of antibody responses to vaccination.<ref name=AFEB /><ref>Oldstone, p. 26</ref><ref>Francis T, Jr. (1953) Vaccination against influenza.

===Neuraminidase and the virus receptor===
[[File:PDB 1vcj EBI.jpg|left|thumb|Influenza [[viral neuraminidase|neuraminidase]] bound to an inhibitor]]
Hirst noticed that hemagglutination tended to wear off over time, and in 1942, he discovered that influenza virus has an intrinsic [[enzyme|enzymatic]] activity that can release the virus from its attachment to red blood cells.<ref name=Schlesinger /><ref name=Colman /><ref name=Laver /><ref name=Kilbourne /> This was a ground-breaking discovery, as previously a key distinction between viruses and bacteria had been that viruses were believed to lack enzymes.<ref>[[Alfred Gottschalk (biochemist)|Gottschalk A]], Bharghava AS. "Neuraminidases" in ''The Enzymes'', Vol. 5 (PD Boyer, ed.), pp. 322<U+2013>333 (Academic Press; 1971) (ISBN 978-0-12-122705-0)</ref> Hirst demonstrated that red blood cells once de-agglutinated could not be re-agglutinated, and correctly deduced that the enzyme destroys a receptor for the virus on the red blood cells. This enzyme, then referred to as the "receptor-destroying enzyme" was later shown to be the influenza [[viral neuraminidase|neuraminidase]], another viral envelope glycoprotein, which acts as a [[sialidase]].<ref name=Schlesinger /><ref name=Colman>Colman PM. (1994) Influenza virus neuraminidase: Structure, antibodies, and inhibitors. ''[[Protein Science]]'' 3: 1687<U+2013>1696 ([http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pro.5560031007/pdf pdf])</ref><ref name=Laver>Laver G. "Influenza virus surface glycoproteins, haemagglutinin and neuraminidase: a personal account" in ''Influenza'' (CW Potter, ed.), p. 31 (''Perspectives in Medical Virology'' series) (Elsevier; 2002) (ISBN 978-0-444-50627-6)</ref> Like hemagglutinin, neuraminidase is essential for the influenza life cycle, being required for the progeny virus to leave the host cell.<ref name=hayden /> Neuraminidase is the target of the [[neuraminidase inhibitor]] class of antiviral drugs, which include [[oseltamivir]] (Tamiflu) and [[zanamivir]] (Relenza).<ref>Jefferson T, Jones M, Doshi P, Del Mar C. (2009) Neuraminidase inhibitors for preventing and treating influenza in healthy adults: systematic review and meta-analysis. ''[[BMJ]]'' 339: b5106 ([http://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b5106.pdf%2Bhtml pdf])</ref>

Hirst subsequently found that influenza virus interacts with a similar receptor on its target cell during infection, providing a model for the initiation of viral infection that turned out to apply to all viruses.<ref name=Schlesinger /><ref name=Kilbourne /> He continued to investigate the nature of this cellular receptor during the 1940s and 1950s, correctly proposing in 1948 that the receptor might be one or more [[mucoprotein]]s.<ref name=Nicholls>Nicholls JM, Lai J, Garcia JM.

(''Milestones in Drug Therapy'' series), p. 32 (Springer; 2012) (ISBN 978-3-7643-8927-7)</ref>

===Segmented influenza genome===
Starting in the late 1940s, Hirst carried out pioneering research into the genetics of animal viruses.<ref name=NYT /> His team built on [[Frank Macfarlane Burnet]]'s work on [[genetic recombination|recombination]] in influenza virus, carrying out a series of experiments that led Hirst to conclude in 1962 that influenza's genome must consist of several separate fragments, "a truly revolutionary idea at the time," according to [[R. Walter Schlesinger]] and [[Allan Granoff]].<ref name=Schlesinger /><ref name=Kilbourne /> Influenza viruses are now known to have eight such segments, and the segmentation of its genome facilitates the exchange of segments between different influenza viruses, causing [[antigenic shift]] which can result in [[influenza pandemic|pandemics]].<ref>DeFranco ''et al''., p. 258</ref> Segmented genomes are also found in many other viruses.<ref name=Kilbourne />

==''Virology'' journal==
Hirst founded the journal ''[[Virology (journal)|Virology]]'' in 1955, together with bacteriophage specialist [[Salvador Luria]] and plant virologist [[Lindsay Black]]. It was the first journal in the English language to specialise in publishing research into viruses, and it united basic science research across viruses infecting all types of host, a life-long objective of Hirst's. The founding editor-in-chief, he headed up the journal for 21 years, until 1975.<ref name=Schlesinger /><ref name=Joklik>[[Wolfgang Joklik|Joklik WK]]. (1999) When two is better than one: Thoughts on three decades of interaction between ''Virology'' and the ''Journal of Virology''. ''[[Journal of Virology|J Virol]]'' 73: 3520<U+2013>3523 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC104123/ text])</ref><ref name=Kilbourne /> On his retirement, he was praised by his co-editors: 

{{quotation|the discipline of virology owes him a large debt of gratitude for the clear vision, unfailing sense of fairness and uncompromising dedication to scientific excellence with which he guided ''Virology'' through the first 21 years of its existence. His hand at the helm will be sorely missed; but he has defined the journal's objectives and established its style.<ref name=Joklik />}}

==Awards and honors==
Hirst gave the 1948 Harvey Lecture of the [[New York Academy of Medicine]] on the topic of "The nature of hemagglutination by viruses" and, in 1961, the inaugural [[Pfizer]] Lecture in Virology at the Institute of Virology in [[Glasgow]], UK, on "Development of virology as an independent science".<ref name=Hirst_1962>Hirst GK.

==Character and personal life==
His colleague Edwin Kilbourne described Hirst as "a scientist's scientist<U+2014>a virologist's virologist" with an "incredible" variety of expertise and an "insatiable curiosity," who pursued the underlying explanation for his experimental findings with tenacity.<ref name=Kilbourne>Kilbourne ED.

His non-scientific pursuits included music <U+2013> he was both a musician and a musicologist <U+2013> gardening, and the appreciation of nature.<ref name=Kilbourne />

Hirst married Charlotte Hart in 1937, and the couple had four sons and a daughter. In retirement he moved to [[Palo Alto]], [[California]]. His wife predeceased him in 1990.<ref name=NYT />
