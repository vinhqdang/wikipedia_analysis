'''Ann Arbor''' is a city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]] and the [[county seat]] of [[Washtenaw County, Michigan|Washtenaw County]]. As of the [[United States 2000 Census|2000 census]], the city had a total population of 114,024. Supposedly named for the spouses of the city's founders and for the stands of trees in the area, Ann Arbor is best known as the location of the main campus of the [[University of Michigan]], which moved there from [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] in 1837. 

The city's economy, which was once noted for production of agricultural implements, carriages, furniture, pianos and organs, pottery, and flour, is now dominated by [[education]], [[high-tech]], and [[biotechnology]]. Average home prices and property taxes are well above the state and national medians. The city is also well known locally as a destination for dining out and entertainment, as it contains a wide and eclectic variety of restaurants and performance venues.

==History==
{{main|History of Ann Arbor, Michigan}}
Ann Arbor was founded in January 1824 by [[John Allen (founder)|John Allen]] and [[Elisha Rumsey]], both of whom were land speculators. There are various accounts concerning the origin of the settlement's name, but one states that Allen and Rumsey decided to name it "Annarbour" for their spouses, both named Ann, and for the stands of burr [[oak]] in the 640 [[acre]]s (260 [[hectare]]s) of land they had purchased for [[United States dollar|$]]800 from the federal government.<ref>[http://moaa.aadl.org/PictHistory/footnote.php#Annarbour Chapter 1 (1824-1859): Ann Arbor/Annarbour - the Naming of Ann Arbor (2003)]. ''Pictorial History of Ann Arbor: 1824-1974'', accessed through the Ann Arbor District Library at moaa.aadl.org/PictHistory/.</ref> The [[Native Americans (U.S.)|Native Americans]] of the region knew the settlement as ''Kaw-goosh-kaw-nick'', after the sound of Allen's grist mill.

Ann Arbor later became the seat of Washtenaw County in 1827, and was incorporated as a village in 1833. The town set aside 40 acres (16 hectares) of undeveloped land and offered it to the State of Michigan as the site of the state capitol, but it lost the bid to [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] in 1836. In 1837 the unused land was given to the [[University of Michigan]], forever linking Ann Arbor and its history with the university.<ref>{{cite book | title=A History of Ann Arbor | author=Marwil, Jonathan | year=June 15, 1991 | publisher=University of Michigan Press | id=ISBN 0472064630 | pages=13}}</ref> The town became a regional transportation hub in 1839 with the arrival of the [[Michigan Central Railroad]]. Ann Arbor was chartered as a city in 1851.

During [[World War II]], [[Ford Motor Company]]'s nearby [[Willow Run]] plant turned out [[B-24 Liberator]] bombers. The population of Ann Arbor exploded with an influx of military personnel, war workers, and their families. 

The city gained a reputation as an important center for liberal politics over the course of the 1960s and 1970s. Presidential candidate [[John F. Kennedy]] unveiled his [[Peace Corps]] proposal in 1960 at the University of Michigan, and there in 1964 President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] first called for a "[[Great Society]]." <ref>[http://moaa.aadl.org/PictHistory/1940-1974pg4.php Progress and Preservation (2003)]. ''Pictorial History of Ann Arbor: 1824-1974'', accessed through the Ann Arbor District Library at moaa.aadl.org/PictHistory/1940-1974pg4.php.</ref> The city also became a locus for [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] activism, serving as a hub for the [[American civil rights movement|civil-rights movement]] and [[Opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War movement]], as well as the student movement. The first major meetings of the national left-wing campus group [[Students for a Democratic Society]] took place in Ann Arbor in 1960, and in 1965 the city was home to the first U.S. [[teach-in]] against the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>[http://moaa.aadl.org/PictHistory/1940-1974pg3.php From Protest to Outer Space (2003)]. ''Pictorial History of Ann Arbor: 1824-1974'', accessed through the Ann Arbor District Library at moaa.aadl.org/PictHistory/1940-1974pg3.php.</ref> Over the course of the ensuing fifteen years, a plethora of [[counterculture|countercultural]] and [[New Left]] enterprises sprang up and developed strong constituencies within the city.

These influences washed into municipal politics during the early and mid-1970s when three members of the local, progressive [[Human Rights Party]] (HRP) won city-council seats on the strength of the student vote. During their time on the council, HRP representatives successfully fought for measures ranging from pioneering [[civil rights|antidiscrimination]] ordinances to [[Marijuana laws in Ann Arbor, Michigan|measures decriminalizing marijuana possession]] to a [[rent control|rent-control]] ordinance <U+2013> many of which remain in effect in modified form today.

Alongside these liberal and left-wing efforts, a small handful of conservative institutions were also born in Ann Arbor. These include [[Word of God (movement)|Word of God]] (established in 1967), a charismatic Catholic movement of national scope;<ref>[http://moaa.aadl.org/PictHistory/1940-1974pg3.php From Protest to Outer Space (2003)]. ''Pictorial History of Ann Arbor: 1824-1974'', accessed through the Ann Arbor District Library at moaa.aadl.org/PictHistory/1940-1974pg3.php.</ref> and the [[Thomas More Law Center]] (established in 1999), a leading religious-conservative advocacy group.

The economy of Ann Arbor underwent a gradual shift from a manufacturing base to a service and technology base over the course of the 20th century, a shift which accelerated in the 1970s and 1980s. At the same time, the downtown has transformed from one dominated primarily by retail establishments dealing in staple goods to one comprised mainly of eateries, caf<U+00E9>s, bars and clubs, and specialty shops.

Over the past several decades, the city has increasingly found itself grappling with the effects of sharply rising land values and [[gentrification]], as well as [[urban sprawl]] stretching far into the outlying countryside. On [[November 2]], [[2004]], voters approved a [[greenbelt]] plan under which the city government would buy development rights to pieces of land adjacent to Ann Arbor to preserve them from sprawling development. Since then, a vociferous local debate has hinged on whether, and how, to accommodate and guide development within city limits.

==Geography and climate==
[[Image:NicholsArb.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Thanks to a reforestation campaign beginning in the early 20th century, Ann Arbor has many trees.]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 27.7&nbsp;[[square mile|mi<U+00B2>]] (71.7&nbsp;[[square kilometre|km<U+00B2>]]); 27.0&nbsp;mi<U+00B2> (70.0&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of it is land and 0.7 mi<U+00B2> (1.7&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of it (2.42%) is water, much of which is part of the [[Huron River (Michigan)|Huron River]]. Ann Arbor is approximately 40&nbsp;[[mile]]s (64&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]) west of [[Detroit]], a 45-minute car ride on [[Interstate 94|I-94]]. [[Ann Arbor Charter Township, Michigan|Ann Arbor Charter Township]] is adjacent, on the city's north and east sides.

Ann Arbor is situated on the [[Huron River (Michigan)|Huron River]], in a productive agricultural and fruit-growing region. The landscape of Ann Arbor consists of rolling hills and [[valley]]s, with the terrain becoming steeper near the Huron River. The elevation ranges from about 750&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (230&nbsp;[[metre|m]]) along the Huron River to about 900&nbsp;feet (275&nbsp;m) above sea level in southern and northeastern Ann Arbor.<ref>''Information obtained from [http://www.topozone.com TopoZone.com]''.</ref> The elevation is about 839&nbsp;feet (256&nbsp;m) at Ann Arbor Municipal Airport, which is located at {{coor dm|42|13.38|N|83|44.74|W|region:US}}.

===Cityscape===
Ann Arbor's "Tree Town" moniker stems from the dense forestation of its parks and residential areas. The city holds almost as many trees as residents, with more than 50,000 trees sited along city streets and an equal number in city parks.<ref>[http://www.annarbor.org/aboutannarbor/funfacts.asp Fun Facts (2005)]. ''Ann Arbor Area Convention and Visitor's Bureau''. Access September 6, 2005.</ref> In recent years, the [[emerald ash borer]] has destroyed many of the city's approximately 10,500 [[ash tree]]s.

The city contains 147 municipal parks, ranging from neighborhood vest-pocket parks to large recreation areas, with several large city parks and a university park bordering sections of the Huron River. The largest are Argo Park, Riverside Park, County Farm Park, and Gallup Park (near the Huron Parkway), while Fuller Recreation Area, near the [[University of Michigan Health System|University Hospital]] complex, contains sports fields, pedestrian and [[bike path]]s, and swimming pools. [[Nichols Arboretum]], which is jointly owned by the City of Ann Arbor and the [[University of Michigan]] (and known locally as "The Arboretum" or just "The Arb"), is a 123-acre (50 hectare) preserve containing hundreds of plant and tree species on the east side of the city near downtown.

The Kerrytown Shops, Main Street Business District, the State Street Business District, and the South University Business District are commercial areas in downtown. Three commercial areas south of downtown include the areas near [[Interstate 94|I-94]] and Ann Arbor-Saline Road, Briarwood Mall, and the South Industrial area. Other commercial areas include the Arborland/Washtenaw Avenue and Packard Road merchants on the east side, the Plymouth Road area in the northeast, and the Westgate/West Stadium areas on the west side. The downtown contains a mix of 19th and early 20th-century structures and modern-style buildings, as well as a [[farmers' market]] in the Kerrytown district. The city's commercial districts are mostly comprised of two to four-story structures, although the downtown and the area near Briarwood Mall contain a small number of high-rise buildings.

Ann Arbor's residential neighborhoods contain a range of architectural styles, from classic 19th and early 20th-century designs to [[ranch-style house]]s. More contemporary-style houses are located farther from the downtown district. Surrounding the University of Michigan campus are houses and apartment complexes occupied primarily by student renters. The 19th-century buildings and streetscape of the Old West Side neighborhood have been preserved virtually intact; in 1972, the district was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and it is further protected via city ordinances and a nonprofit preservation group.<ref>[http://www.oldwestside.org/ Old West Side Association]. ''Accessed June 4, 2006''.</ref>

===Climate===
Ann Arbor has a typically [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] [[temperate]] seasonal climate, which is influenced by the [[Great Lakes]]. There are four seasons, with winters being cold with moderate [[snowfall]] while summers can be warm and humid. The area does experience [[lake effect]], primarily in the form of increased cloudiness during late fall and early winter.<ref>[http://www.michiganvacations.com/regions/Ann-Arbor-Michigan.html Ann Arbor]. ''MichiganVacations.com''. Accessed August 18, 2005.</ref> The highest average temperature is in July at 83&nbsp;<U+00B0>[[fahrenheit|F]] (28&nbsp;<U+00B0>[[celsius|C]]) while the lowest average temperature is in January at 16&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (<U+2212>9&nbsp;<U+00B0>C). However, summer temperatures can top 90&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (32&nbsp;<U+00B0>C), and winter temperatures can drop below 0&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (<U+2212>17&nbsp;<U+00B0>C). Average monthly precipitation ranges from 2 to 4&nbsp;[[inch]]es (44 to 92&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]]), with the heaviest occurring during the summer months. Snowfall, which normally occurs from November to April, ranges from 1 to 10&nbsp;inches (3 to 25&nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]]) per month.<ref>[http://www.wunderground.com/NORMS/DisplayNORMS.asp?AirportCode=KYIP&SafeCityName=Ann_Arbor&StateCode=MI&Units=none&IATA=DTW Average High/Low Temperatures for KYIP].

==Law and government==
[[Image:AACityHall.JPG|thumb|200px|The Guy C. Larcom, Jr. Municipal Building houses the city hall and police station]]
Ann Arbor has a [[mayor]]-[[city council|council]] form of government. The mayor, who is elected every even-numbered year, is the presiding officer of the City Council and has the power to appoint all Council committee members as well as board and commission members, with the approval of the City Council. The City Council has ten members, two from each of the city's five wards, with the mayor wielding the tie-breaking vote. Council members serve two-year terms, with half the council elected in annual elections. 

Ann Arbor is located in the 15th Congressional district, and is represented by Representative [[John Dingell]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]), the longest-serving member of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]]. On the state level, the city is in the 18th district in the [[Michigan Senate]]. In the [[Michigan State House of Representatives]], the city of Ann Arbor is in the 53rd district, while northeastern Ann Arbor and Ann Arbor Township are in the 52nd district. As the seat of [[Washtenaw County, Michigan|Washtenaw County]], the city is the location of the county's trial, civil, and criminal courts. Ann Arbor is also the site of a [[United States district court]], whose downtown building also houses a [[post office]].

[[Left-wing politics]] have been particularly strong in municipal government since the 1960s <U+2013> an orientation evident in the passage of [[rent control|rent-control]] and strong [[civil rights|antidiscrimination]] ordinances, as well as voter-approved charter amendments that have [[Marijuana laws in Ann Arbor, Michigan|lessened the penalties]] for possession of marijuana (1974) and that aim to protect access to [[abortion]] in the city should it ever become illegal in the State of Michigan (1990). In 1974, [[Kathy Kozachenko|Kathy Kozachenko's]] victory in an Ann Arbor city-council race made her the country's first openly [[homosexuality|gay]] or [[lesbian]] candidate to win public office. In 1975, Ann Arbor became the first U.S. city to use [[instant-runoff voting]] for a mayoral race. Adopted through a ballot initiative sponsored by the local [[Human Rights Party]], which feared a splintering of the left/liberal vote, the process was repealed in 1976 after use in only one election. As of February 2006, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] hold the mayorship and all ten council seats.

Ann Arbor is the [[Town twinning|sister city]] to various municipalities around the world, including [[T<U+00FC>bingen]], [[Germany]] (since 1965); [[Belize City]], [[Belize]] (since 1967); [[Hikone]], [[Japan]] (since 1969); [[Peterborough, Ontario]], [[Canada]] (since 1983); [[Juigalpa]], [[Nicaragua]] (since 1986); [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]] (since 1997); and [[Remedios]], [[Cuba]] (since 2003).

==Economy==
The University of Michigan shapes Ann Arbor's economy, both directly and indirectly. It employs about 30,000 workers, including about 7,500 in the medical center.<ref>[http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Midwest/Ann-Arbor-Economy.html Ann Arbor: Economy (2006)], at www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Midwest/Ann-Arbor-Economy.html.</ref> Other employers are drawn to the area by the university's research and development money, and by its graduates. [[High tech]], health services and [[biotechnology]] are other major components of the city's economy, with numerous medical offices, laboratories, and associated companies located within the city. Companies associated with the [[automobile industry]], such as [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], also employ a large number of residents.

[[Image:NicholsArcadeAnnArbor.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Nichols Arcade interior, looking towards the east]]
A number of high-tech companies are located in the city. Ann Arbor Terminals was, during the 1980s, the manufacturer of a video-display terminal called the Ann Arbor Ambassador. Other high-tech companies in the area include Arbor Networks (provider of Internet traffic engineering and security systems), Arbortext (provider of XML-based publishing software), MediaSpan Media Software (provider of newspaper publishing software and ASP services), and [[ProQuest]], which includes [[UMI]].

Websites and online media companies located in the city include [[All Media Guide]], [[Everything2]], and the [[Weather Underground (weather service)|Weather Underground]]. Ann Arbor is also the site of the Michigan Information Technology Center (MITC), whose offices also house [[Internet2]] and the [[Merit Network]], a nonprofit research and education computer network.<ref>[http://www.michitc.org/ Michigan Information Technology Center]. ''Accessed June 4, 2006''.</ref> On [[July 11]], [[2006]], [[Google]] announced plans to open a 1000-employee Ann Arbor office for its [[AdWords]] program later in the year.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/11/AR2006071100225.html Google Plans to Open Facility in Michigan]. ''Accessed July 12, 2006''.</ref>

[[Pfizer]], the city's second largest employer, operates a large pharmaceutical research facility on the northeast side of town. The facility was previously operated by Warner-Lambert and, before that, Parke-Davis. The city is the home of other research and engineering centers, including those of [[General Dynamics]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA). Other research centers sited in the city are the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]'s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory and the [[Toyota|Toyota Technical Center]]. 

Ann Arbor serves as the headquarters to several major companies. The original [[Borders Books]] was opened on Ann Arbor's State Street in 1971 by brothers Tom and Louis Borders, and began operating other outlets around the region beginning in 1985. The Borders chain is still based in the city, as is its flagship store (although not in its original location). Dogs are allowed inside the flagship store, and the cashiers have a stock of treats for such visitors.<ref>Blakeley, Pam (2005-2006).

''Accessed June 4, 2006''.</ref> Flint Ink Corp., another Ann Arbor-based company, was until recently the world's largest privately held ink manufacturer (in October 2005 it was acquired by Stuttgart-based XSYS Print Solutions). Another Ann Arbor-based company is [[Zingerman's|Zingerman's Delicatessen]], which serves sandwiches and Jewish foods, and has derived and developed a variety of businesses under different brand names.

Many [[cooperatives|cooperative]] enterprises were founded in the city during the 1960s and 1970s; among those that survive today are the [[People's Food Co-op, Ann Arbor|People's Food Co-op]] and the [[Inter-Cooperative Council at the University of Michigan]], a student-housing cooperative. The [[North American Students of Cooperation]] (NASCO) is an association of cooperatives, headquartered in Ann Arbor. There are also three [[cohousing]] communities ([[Sunward]], Great Oak, Touchstone) located just outside the city limits to the west.

==Education==
[[image:Annarbor um law library.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Rackham School of Graduate Studies, University of Michigan]]
The [[University of Michigan]] is the dominant institution of higher learning in Ann Arbor, providing the city with a distinctly [[college town|college-town]] atmosphere.<ref>Cochran, Jason (October 2002). [http://www.budgettravelonline.com/bt-dyn/content/article/2005/06/04/AR2005060400887.html Ann Arbor, Michigan]. ''Budget Travel Online'', at www.budgettravelonline.com/bt-dyn/content/article/2005/06/04/AR2005060400887.html.</ref> Much of the campus is adjacent to and intermixed with the city's downtown district. Because the campus and the city expanded side-by-side, there is often no firm divide between the two, with university buildings scattered through much of the city center.

Other colleges and universities located in the city are [[Cleary University]], a private business school; [[Concordia University, Ann Arbor|Concordia University]], a Lutheran liberal-arts institution; and [[Washtenaw Community College]]. [[Ave Maria School of Law]], a Catholic institution established by [[Domino's Pizza]] cofounder [[Tom Monaghan]], opened in northeastern Ann Arbor in 2000. There were plans to establish [[Ave Maria University]] on land occupied by Domino's Farms. However, due to conflicts with local zoning authorities, the new campus is under construction near [[Naples, Florida]].

The Ann Arbor Public School District <U+2013> which enrolls a total of 16,885 students (2004/2005 September head count) <U+2013> consists of twenty-one [[elementary school]]s, five [[middle school]]s, and five [[high school]]s (two traditional, [[Pioneer High School|Pioneer]] and [[Huron High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan|Huron]], as well as three alternative schools: [[Community High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan|Community High]], Stone School, and Roberto Clemente).<ref>[http://www.aaps.k12.mi.us/aaps.about/aaps.data0506/headcount_by_grade_and_school Headcount by Grade and School (2005)]. ''About AAPS: Demographics Data'', at www.aaps.k12.mi.us/aaps.about/demographic_data.</ref> The district operates an open school program out of Mack Elementary School, as well as a preschool and family center with programs starting as early as birth for at-risk infants and other programs for at-risk children before [[kindergarten]].

Due to overcrowding problems at the two traditional high schools, a third traditional high school is under construction. Originally slated to open for the fall of 2007, the school's completion date and budget status is in jeopardy as of February 2006. Ann Arbor Public School officials are currently looking at other options for accommodating the district's students until the third high school is complete.

Ann Arbor has a number of cultural attractions and events, many sponsored by the University of Michigan. Numerous performing arts groups and facilities are located on the university's campus, as are museums dedicated to [[art]], [[archaeology]], and natural history and sciences (''see [[Museums at the University of Michigan]]''). The [[Matthaei Botanical Gardens]], located on the northeastern edge of Ann Arbor, is operated by the university. Performing arts groups not associated with the university include the Ann Arbor Civic Theatre; the Arbor Opera Theater; the Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra; the Ann Arbor Ballet Theater; the Ann Arbor Civic Ballet (established in 1954), which was Michigan's first chartered ballet company<ref>[http://www.arborweb.com/entindex.html City Guide <U+2014> Dance]. ''arborweb.com''. Accessed August 18, 2005.</ref>; and Performance Network, which operates a downtown theater frequently offering new or nontraditional plays.

The [[Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum]], located in a historic downtown fire station, contains more than 250 interactive exhibits featuring science and technology. Artrain, located on North Main Street, is a traveling art museum located on a train.<ref>[http://www.artrainusa.org/about-artrainusa.asp Artrain USA: About Artrain]. ''Accessed June 4, 2006.</ref> A number of other art galleries exist in the city, notably in the downtown area and around the University of Michigan campus.

Near the State Street area are three major [[theater]]s: the State Theater, the University of Michigan's [[Hill Auditorium]], and the [[Michigan Theater (Ann Arbor)|Michigan Theater]], a renovated 1920s movie palace that hosts live performances, independent films, and classic movies. It also serves as the home for the Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra In the Main Street area, the [[Ark (folk venue)|Ark]] hosts folk and acoustic music, while a number of smaller venues and [[nightclub]]s serve up jazz and other live music. The Main Street area, as well as South State Street and South University Avenue, is also the center of a large restaurant scene in the city.

Among U.S. cities, Ann Arbor ranks first in the number of booksellers and books sold per capita.<ref>[http://www.ecurrent.com/ag/2003/shop/list.php#boo Ann Arbor Guide 2003-4]. ''Ecurrent.com''. Accessed August 17, 2005.</ref> The Ann Arbor District Library has three branch outlets in addition to its main downtown building. A fourth branch opened on [[March 20]], [[2006]], and a fifth branch is set to open in 2008. The city is also home to the [[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library]].

Ann Arbor is known for college sports, notably at the University of Michigan, a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]]. Several well-known college sports facilities exist in the city, including [[Michigan Stadium]] (whose seating capacity rivals the entire population of Ann Arbor), [[Crisler Arena]], and [[Yost Ice Arena]]. [[Concordia University, Ann Arbor, Michigan|Concordia University]], a member of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]], also fields sports teams.

A person from Ann Arbor is called an "Ann Arborite." The city itself is often called ''A<U+00B2>'' ("A-squared") or ''A2'' ("A two"), and less commonly ''Tree Town'' (or, usually [[tongue-in-cheek]], ''The People's Republic of Ann Arbor''). Recently, some youth have taken to calling Ann Arbor ''Ace Deuce'' or simply ''The Deuce''.  Ann Arbor is also referred to as "28 square miles surrounded by reality."

===Events===
A number of annual events <U+2013> many of them centered on performing and visual arts <U+2013> draw visitors to Ann Arbor from around the state and the region. The Ann Arbor Folk Festival, an annual [[benefit concert]] held in late January for the [[Ark (folk venue)|Ark]], features many folk musicians. The [[Ann Arbor Film Festival]] is held for six days in March at the [[Michigan Theater (Ann Arbor)|Michigan Theater]]. EdgeFest is a multi-venue festival of avant-garde and progressive jazz, held each autumn since 1997.

One unorthodox annual event is [[Hash Bash]]. Held on the first Saturday of April since 1971, the Hash Bash is an event in support of the reform of [[marijuana]] laws. It includes speeches, live music, street vending, and occasional [[civil disobedience]]. Another unorthodox event is the Naked Mile. Since 1986, it has featured students [[Streaking|running naked]] through the streets in late April to celebrate the end of the winter semester. Originally police blocked off the streets to allow the run, but beginning in 2000, a crackdown by university and city police citing safety concerns has forced participants to adapt, with the event appearing in various reduced forms since.<ref>[http://www.goodspeedupdate.com/naked-mile-data-4-10-03.html Naked Mile Data Page]. ''goodspeedupdate.com''.</ref>

Many large-scale events occur during the summer months. These include the Taste of Ann Arbor, a one-day event held during the first week of June in the downtown area; and the Ann Arbor Summer Festival, a three-and-a-half-week series of concerts, plays, and films typically held from mid-June through early July at the Power Center and atop the adjacent parking structure, which is host to the free "Top of the Park" events.

The [[Ann Arbor Art Fairs]], a set of four concurrent juried fairs held on downtown streets, began in 1960. Scheduled on Wednesday through Saturday in the third week of July, the fairs draw upward of half a million visitors from across the nation. The oldest and most competitive of the four fairs is the Ann Arbor Street Art Fair.

Other summertime events include the Blues and Jazz Festival (established in 1969), which is usually held in mid-September at Gallup Park. The Dexter-Ann Arbor Run is a running race from [[Dexter, Michigan|Dexter]] to downtown Ann Arbor along the [[Huron River (Michigan)|Huron River]]. In late August the Shopping Cart Race, an unofficial and somewhat underground competition, has been held since 1998 as part of the annual [[Seize the Week, Ann Arbor, Michigan|Seize the Week]] series of events, known through 2004 as "Punk Week".

===Media===
The ''Ann Arbor News'', owned by the Michigan-based [[Booth Newspapers]] chain, is the major daily newspaper serving Ann Arbor. Other established publications in the city include the ''Ann Arbor Observer'' (a monthly magazine with features covering local culture, politics, family life, business and history, as well as a comprehensive calendar of events), ''Current'' (an entertainment guide), and ''Ann Arbor Paper'' (a free monthly with columns, fiction, humor, reviews, and profiles). The campus area is served by a variety of student publications, including the independent ''[[Michigan Daily]]''.

The three major Ann Arbor<U+2013>based [[amplitude modulation|AM]] [[radio station]]s are [[WAAM]] 1600, a news and talk station; [[WLBY]] 1290, an [[Air America Radio]] affiliate; and [[WTKA]] 1050, which is primarily a sports station.

==Infrastructure==
===Health and medicine===
The [[University of Michigan Health System|University of Michigan Medical Center]], the preeminent health facility in the city, is considered one of the nation's best hospitals, taking the #11 slot in the 2005 ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]''.<ref>[http://www.usnews.com/usnews/health/best-hospitals/honorroll.htm America's Best Hospitals 2005: Honor Roll (2006)]. ''US News and World Reports''.</ref> The University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) includes University Hospital, C.S. Mott Children's Hospital and Women's Hospital in its core complex. UMHS also operates out-patient clinics and facilities throughout the city. The area's other major medical centers include a large facility operated by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] in Ann Arbor and Saint Joseph Mercy Hospital in nearby [[Ypsilanti, Michigan|Ypsilanti]].

===Transportation===
[[Image:AATA Bus.JPG|thumb|200px|An AATA bus, with the blue-roofed Blake Transit Center in the background.]]
The city is belted by three [[highway]]-grade roadways: [[Interstate 94|I-94]] (which runs along the southern portion of the city), [[U.S. Highway 23|US 23]] (which primarily runs along the eastern edge of Ann Arbor), and [[Michigan State Highway 14|M-14]] (which runs along the northern edge of the city).

The streets in downtown Ann Arbor conform to a grid pattern, though this pattern is less apparent in the surrounding areas. Several major roads branch out from the downtown district like spokes on a wheel to the highways surrounding the city. Some of the major surface arteries lead to the I-94/M-14 juncture in the west, US 23 in the east, and the city's southern areas. Also, a large network of [[bike path]]s crisscrosses the city.

The [[Ann Arbor Transportation Authority]] (AATA), which brands itself as "The Ride," operates public [[bus]] services throughout Ann Arbor and nearby [[Ypsilanti, Michigan|Ypsilanti]]. A separate free bus service operates within the University of Michigan campuses. Plans have been floated several times to operate a trolley service between downtown and Briarwood Mall along disused rail tracks, although these have not come to fruition as of 2005. A downtown bus depot served by [[Greyhound Lines]] provides out-of-town bus service, and is the city's only remaining example of the [[Streamline Moderne]] architectural style.

[[Ann Arbor Municipal Airport]] is a small aircraft general aviation facility located south of [[Interstate 94|I-94]]. [[Detroit Metropolitan Airport]], the area's large international airport, is located about 28 miles (45 km) east of the city, in [[Romulus, Michigan|Romulus]]. Additionally, [[Willow Run Airport]] in nearby Ypsilanti serves freight, corporate, and general aviation clients.

The city was a major rail hub, notably for freight traffic between [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] and ports north of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] from 1878 to 1982, though the [[Ann Arbor Railroad]] also sold 1.1 million passenger tickets in 1913 alone.<ref>[http://clarke.cmich.edu/michrailroads/building.htm Michigan's Ann Arbor Railroads <U+2014> Building the Ann Arbor]. ''Central Michigan University <U+2014> Clarke Historical Library''. Accessed September 1, 2005.</ref> The city was also served by the [[Michigan Central Railroad]] starting in 1837. 
Currently, [[Amtrak]] provides service to Ann Arbor, operating its [[Michigan Services|Wolverine]] three times daily in each direction between [[Chicago, Illinois]], and [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]], via [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]]. Rail service is provided at the Ann Arbor Train Station; the present-day station neighbors the city's old Michigan Central Depot, which was renovated as a restaurant in 1969. There have been plans to build a [[commuter rail]] link between Ann Arbor and Detroit, with the U.S. federal government providing [[United States dollar|$]]100 million to enable its development.<ref>Mulcahy, John (August 28, 2005). [http://www.mlive.com/news/aanews/index.ssf?/base/news-14/112522397069040.xml&coll=2 Is commuter rail finally on fast track? Federal grant gets Ann Arbor-Detroit link moving]. ''Ann Arbor News''.

The city provides sewage disposal and water supply services, with water coming from the Huron River and groundwater sources. There are two [[Water purification|water-treatment]] plants, one main and three outlying [[dam|reservoirs]], four pump stations, and two [[water tower|elevated tanks]]. These facilities serve the city, which is divided into five water districts. Along with these facilities, the city's water department also operates four dams along the Huron River, two of which provide [[hydroelectric power]].<ref>[http://www.ci.ann-arbor.mi.us/PublicServices/Water/WTP/int-treat.html Water Treatment (2005)]. ''City of Ann Arbor''. Accessed September 7, 2005.</ref> The city also offers waste management services, with recycling being handled by Recycle Ann Arbor. Other utilities are primarily provided by private entities. [[Electrical power]] and gas are provided by DTE Energy, Consumers Energy, and MichCon. [[AT&T]], the successor to Michigan Bell, [[Ameritech]], and SBC Communications, is the primary wired telephone service provider for the area. Phone service is also available from various [[List of United States mobile phone companies|national wireless companies]]. Cable service is primarily provided by [[Comcast]].
