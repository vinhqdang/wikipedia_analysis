'''Typhoon Xangsane''' (international designation: '''''0615''''', JTWC designation: '''''18W''''', PAGASA name '''Typhoon Milenyo''') was a deadly typhoon that affected the [[Philippines]],  [[Vietnam]], and [[Thailand]] during the [[2006 Pacific typhoon season]]. It was the fifteenth tropical storm and ninth typhoon recognized by the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] operationally during the season, although in post-operational analysis it became the tenth typhoon of the season with the addition of Typhoon Maria. According to the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]], Xangsane was the sixteenth tropical storm and tenth typhoon of the season, and was a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 4-equivalent]] typhoon in terms of 1-minute average wind speeds. The name Xangsane was submitted by [[Laos]] and means [[elephant]].<ref name="Typhoon Name (RSMC)">{{cite web| url=http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/jma-eng/jma-center/rsmc-hp-pub-eg/tyname.html| title=List of names for tropical cyclones adopted by the Typhoon Committee for the western North Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea | author=RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center |publisher = [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] | accessdate=2006-10-08}}</ref>

Xangsane made landfall in the Philippines, battering the northern islands with torrential rains and strong winds, and causing widespread flooding and landslides. After passing over [[Manila]] and emerging over the [[South China Sea]], the typhoon made a second landfall in central Vietnam, also causing flooding and landslides there and in Thailand. The storm was responsible for at least 279 deaths, mostly in the Philippines and Vietnam, and at least $747 million (2006 USD) in damage.<ref name="RW-Xinhua">{{cite news | url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/VBOL-6UBDD7?OpenDocument | title=Typhoon, flood claim 71 lives in central Vietnam | date=[[2006-10-06]] | accessdate=2006-10-08 | author=Xinhua News Agency|publisher=ReliefWeb}}</ref><ref name="NDCC">{{cite web | url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/VBOL-6U9D4Y?OpenDocument&rc=3&emid=TC-2006-000144-PHL | title=NDCC media update effects of Typhoon "Milenyo" (Xangsane) - 04 Oct 2006 | date=[[2006-10-04]] | accessdate=2006-10-09 | publisher=ReliefWeb | author=Government of the Philippines}}</ref>

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Xangsane 2006 track.png}}
On [[September 25]], the [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]] (PAGASA) named an active low pressure area within its area of responsibility Tropical Depression Milenyo. Having earlier issued a [[Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert]], the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) issued its first warning on Tropical Depression 18W the same day. On [[September 26]] the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] (JMA) designated the system Tropical Storm Xangsane. 

Xangsane rapidly intensified and later that day, the JMA upgraded Xangsane to a severe tropical storm. Xangsane made landfall on [[Samar Island]] as a severe tropical storm, before a bout of further rapid intensification occurred. All three agencies, the JMA, JTWC and PAGASA upgraded the storm to a typhoon late on [[September 26]] or early [[September 27]]. 

Xangsane then passed through the [[Philippines|Philippine islands]], wreaking havoc and becoming the strongest typhoon to directly impact [[Metro Manila]] in eleven years.<ref name="Metro Manila">{{cite news | url=http://newsinfo.inq7.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=23757 | title=Typhoon batters Metro Manila, Bicol | date=[[2006-09-29]] | accessdate=2006-10-08 | author=Rivera, Blanche | publisher=INQ7}}</ref> As it entered the [[South China Sea]] as a weak typhoon, it began to re-intensify, reaching its secondary peak strength shortly before landfall near [[Hu<U+1EBF>]] on [[October 1]]. The JTWC ceased advisories after landfall, while the JMA carried the storm inland until it was over [[Thailand]] as a tropical depression. It remained as a low pressure area over central [[Indochina]] on the JMA's weather charts for several days, while the [[U.S. Navy]]'s Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting system carried the remnants of Xangsane into the [[Bay of Bengal]].

==Preparations==
===Philippines===
[[Image:Affected Philippine provinces by typhoon Xangsane 2006.PNG|thumb|right|Provinces of the Philippines in which public storm signals were raised for preparations against Typhoon Milenyo.]]
On [[September 27]], [[PAGASA]] issued Storm Signal Number 3, a warning for winds of 100&ndash;185 km/h (62&ndash;115 mph), for areas of southern [[Luzon]]. Storm Signal Number 2, for winds of 60&ndash;100 km/h (37&ndash;62 mph), was raised for northern [[Samar Island]] and central Luzon. Storm Signal Number 1 (30&ndash;60 km/h, 20&ndash;37 mph) was issued for northwestern Luzon, including [[Metro Manila]], and northern [[Visayas]], including the rest of [[Samar Island]]. Schools in the warned area were suspended, and airports and seaports were closed. [[Philippine Airlines]] cancelled over half of its flights to and from [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] for [[September 28]], and various transit services also suspended service.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2006/sept/29/yehey/top_stories/20060929top4.html | title=NAIA shuts down, flights cancelled | date=[[2006-09-29]] | accessdate=2006-10-10 | publisher=[[Manila Times]]}}</ref> Metro Manila and the [[CALABARZON|Tagalog province]]s were warned of possible flooding and strong winds.<ref name="GMA7">{{cite news | url=http://newsinfo.inq7.net/breakingnews/metroregions/view_article.php?article_id=23460 | title=Milenyo could hit Metro Manila - PAGASA | date=[[2006-09-27]] | accessdate=2006-10-07 | publisher=INQ7}}</ref>

When it became clear that Xangsane would approach Metro Manila, PAGASA upgraded the warning for Manila and central Luzon to Storm Signal Number 3 on [[September 28]]. All the storm signals were discontinued later that day.<ref name="PAGASA 12">{{cite web | url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/EKOI-6U43UK?OpenDocument&rc=3&emid=TC-2006-000144-PHL | title=Severe weather bulletin - number 12 | date=[[2006-09-28]] | accessdate=2006-10-07 | author=[[PAGASA]]|publisher=ReliefWeb}}</ref>

===Vietnam===

Prior to Xangsane's final landfall, the Vietnamese government set up a steering committee headed by Deputy Prime Minister [[Nguyen Sinh Hung]] to oversee evacuations and storm preparations throughout central Vietnam.<ref name="VNN-prep2">{{cite web | url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/social/2006/09/617346/ | title=Over 180,000 people must evacuate to avoid Xangsane | date=[[2006-09-30]] | accessdate=2006-11-04 | publisher=VietNamNet}}</ref> Provincial and local authorities evacuated over 300,000 people from low-lying areas in [[Ha Tinh]] and [[Phu Yen]], as well as hilly areas prone to [[landslide]]s.

===Thailand===

Although Xangsane had weakened considerably over land, residents of northern Thailand were advised of the threat of flooding from the remnant low of Xangsane as it approached. The Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation alerted its provincial offices throughout the country to be prepared for strong winds, [[flash flood]]ing, and landslides. Residents in highland areas were also warned of possible [[mudslide]]s, and the army was dispatched to aid in regional storm preparations.<ref name="OCHA2">{{cite web | url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/KKEE-6U8LU2?OpenDocument&rc=3&emid=TC-2006-000144-PHL | title=The Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand: Typhoon OCHA Situation Report No. 2 | date=[[2006-10-03]] | accessdate=2006-10-07 | author=[[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]]|publisher=ReliefWeb}}</ref>

===Philippines===
Damage was widespread in the Philippines, particularly in [[Metro Manila]], which the typhoon passed almost directly over. Power and water was lost in several provinces, while overflowing rivers caused flooding, landslides and made roads impassable. In some parts of the country, electricity was cut of for up to six straight days.<ref name="RW-CRE">{{cite web | url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/KKEE-6U8Q4J?OpenDocument&rc=3&emid=TC-2006-000144-PHL | title=The Red Cross sends emergency equipment to support the victims of Typhoon Xangsane (Spanish) | date=[[2006-10-03]] | accessdate=2006-10-08 | author=Cruz Roja Espa<U+00F1>ola|publisher=ReliefWeb}}</ref> Many trees and billboards were toppled by Xangsane, while [[Luzon]] suffered an island-wide power outage.<ref name="Metro Manila"/> Rough waters and seaport closures left at least 3,400 people and nearly 270 vehicles stranded in ports and terminals, mainly at the primary ferry crossing between Samar Island and [[Bicol Region]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2006/sept/28/yehey/top_stories/20060928top3.html | title=<U+2018>Milenyo<U+2019> slams into RP; Metro Manila in its path | date=[[2006-09-28]] | accessdate=2006-10-10 | author=Ivan, Mark et al. | publisher=[[Manila Times]]}}</ref> Local and provincial officials described Xangsane as the worst typhoon to directly impact Manila in 11 years, when [[1995 Pacific typhoon season#Super Typhoon Angela (Rosing)|Typhoon Angela]] passed over the city.<ref name="Metro Manila"/>

===Vietnam===
Xangsane made its second and final landfall in central Vietnam, causing severe flooding and strong winds that caused nearly 10 trillion [[Vietnamese dong]] ($629 million, 2006 USD) in damage and killed 71 people. The worst structural damage occurred in the city of [[Da Nang]], where 26 people were killed. The provinces of [[Quang Nam]] and [[Nghe An]] were also hard hit, with a total of 25 people killed.<ref name="RW-Xinhua"/> The storm damaged or destroyed around 320,000 homes, downed thousands of trees and power lines, and flooded major streets.<ref name="RW-Reuters">{{cite news | url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/KHII-6UA87C?OpenDocument | title=Typhoon Xangsane, flood toll reaches 169 | date=[[2006-10-05]] | accessdate=2006-10-08 | author=[[Reuters]]|publisher=ReliefWeb}}</ref>

===Thailand===
The remnants of Xangsane moved over Thailand on [[October 2]] and combined with monsoonal moisture over the north central part of the country, causing torrential rains and severe flooding in over 35 provinces. Floodwaters broke through levees and barriers and flooded or damaged nearly 1.3 million [[rai]] (2,100 [[square kilometre|km<U+00B2>]], 520,000 acres) of farmland and local infrastructure.<ref name="RW-Thai">{{cite web | url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/AMMF-6U9D6R?OpenDocument | title=Thailand: Floods Information Bulletin No. 1 | date=[[2006-10-04]] | accessdate=2006-10-08 | author=International Federation of Red Cross And Red Crescent Societies|publisher=ReliefWeb}}</ref> Many municipalities reported flooding of up to three meters (10 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]),<ref name="RW-Thai"/> and the municipality of [[Angthong]] reported flooding of 60 cm (2 ft).

A broad area of 4- to 8-inch totals (green) stretches from the central Philippines to the coast of Vietnam.]]
Following the passage of Xangsane, the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (IFRC) issued an emergency request for 5.7 million [[Swiss franc]]s ($4.6 million, 2006 USD) to aid the Philippine Red Cross in its relief effort. In addition, the movement dispatched 3,000 workers and three disaster response teams to affected areas for search and rescue missions, damage assessments, and assistance to people affected by the typhoon. The Philippine Red Cross provided canned goods, rice, clothing, and personal hygiene items to over 6,300 families, and local volunteers provided assistance to people in shelters.<ref name="RW-IFRCPh">{{cite web | url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/AMMF-6U8E4K?OpenDocument&rc=3&emid=TC-2006-000144-PHL | title=International Federation launches emergency appeal as the Philippines faces another violent storm | date=[[2006-10-03]] | accessdate=2006-10-09 | author=[[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]]|publisher=ReliefWeb}}</ref> The Spanish Red Cross, present since 1998 as a backup to the Philippine Red Cross, also sent officials, logistics equipment, and water purification systems to the more heavily areas to aid in disaster relief and damage assessments.<ref name="RW-CRE"/>

[[Image:Billboard structure crushes a bus during Typhoon Xangsane.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A passenger bus is crushed by a billboard structure along [[EDSA]] at the Magallanes interchange in [[Makati City]].]]
In Manila, fallen [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]]s killed several people and caused traffic delays along [[EDSA]], the main highway of the metropolis. This prompted some members of the [[Senate of the Philippines]] to push for the removal and banning of billboard advertising in the Manila area, which had been an issue for some time. Senator [[Miriam Defensor-Santiago]] wrote an appeal to President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], asking her to approve the "Anti-Billboard Blight Act of 2006", which would ban billboard advertising on major thoroughfares within [[Metro Manila]].<ref name="Billboard">{{cite news | url=http://newsinfo.inq7.net/topstories/topstories/view_article.php?article_id=24254 | title=Senator, solon seek permanent billboard ban | date=[[2006-10-02]] | accessdate=2006-10-09 | author=Ager, Maila | publisher=INQ7}}</ref>

===Vietnam===

On [[October 3]], the IFRC released 100,000 Swiss francs ($80,300, 2006 USD) from its disaster relief fund to support the Red Cross of Vietnam,<ref name="RW-IFRCPh"/> and issued an emergency appeal for 1 million Swiss francs ($810,000, 2006 USD) in aid the next day. The Vietnamese government also released 100 billion Vietnamese dong ($6.2 million, 2006 USD) and 1,500 [[metric ton]]s (1,650 [[short ton]]s) of rice from the national food security stock to help the recovery effort in central Vietnam. The [[Vietnamese Fatherland Front|National Fatherland Front]] also issued an appeal to national and international organizations for donations and aid.<ref name="RW-IFRC-1004"/>

===Thailand===
The Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation and the Thai Red Cross Society evacuated residents from areas of central Thailand that had been affected by flooding from the remnants of Xangsane. The Red Cross also provided victims and evacuees with food and emergency kits, and several Red Cross health centers in 12 provinces issued emergency relief kits, drinking water, and medicine kits to at least 16,000 families in flood-stricken areas.<ref name="RW-Thai"/>

===Retirement===
As a result of the deaths and damage caused, it was decided at the 39th annual meeting of the [[ESCAP]]/[[WMO]] Typhoon Committee in [[Manila]] in [[December 2006]] that the name ''Xangsane'', along with four others, would be retired from the name list. A replacement name is to be submitted at the 40th meeting of the committee in 2007.<ref>http://www.cma.gov.cn/qxxw/t20061213_171681.phtml</ref>
