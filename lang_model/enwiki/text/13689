The '''American Civil Liberties Union''' ('''ACLU''') is a nonpartisan [[non-profit organization]] whose stated mission is "to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed to every person in this country by the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and laws of the United States."<ref>[http://www.aclu.org/faqs ACLU FAQs]</ref> It works through [[litigation]], [[lobbying]], and community education. Founded in 1920 by [[Crystal Eastman]], [[Roger Nash Baldwin|Roger Baldwin]] and [[Walter Nelles]], the ACLU has over 500,000 members and has an annual budget over $100 million. Local affiliates of the ACLU are active in all 50 states and Puerto Rico. The ACLU provides legal assistance in cases in which it considers [[civil liberties]] to be at risk. Legal support from the ACLU can take the form of direct legal representation, or preparation of ''[[amicus curiae]]'' [[brief (law)|briefs]] expressing legal arguments (when another law firm is already providing representation).  

When the ACLU was founded in 1920, its focus was on [[freedom of speech]], primarily for anti-war protesters. During the 1920s, the ACLU expanded its scope to also include protecting the free speech rights of artists and striking workers, and to working with the [[NAACP]] to combat racism. During the 1930s, the ACLU started to engage in work combatting police misconduct and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] rights. Most of the ACLU's cases came from the [[Communist Party of the United States|Communist party]] and the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. In 1940, ACLU leadership was caught up in the [[Red Scare]], and voted to exclude [[Communist]]s from its leadership positions. During [[World War II]], the ACLU defended Japanese American citizens who were forcibly relocated to [[Japanese American internment|internment camps]]. During the [[Cold War]], the ACLU headquarters was dominated by anti-communists, but many local affiliates defended members of the Communist Party.

By 1964, membership had risen to 80,000, and the ACLU was directly involved in a major expansion of civil liberties. In the 1960s, the ACLU continued its decades-long effort to enforce separation of church and state, and it also defended several anti-war activists who protested the [[Vietnam War]] by burning draft cards or wearing armbands. The ACLU was involved in the ''[[Miranda v. Arizona|Miranda]]'' case, which addressed misconduct by police during interrogations; and in the ''[[New York Times Co. v. United States|New York Times]]'' case which established new protections for newspapers reporting on government activities. In the 1970s and 1980s, the ACLU ventured into new legal areas, defending homosexuals, students, prisoners, and the poor. In the twenty-first century, the ACLU has fought the teaching of [[Creationism]] in public schools, and challenged some provisions of [[USA PATRIOT Act|anti-terrorism legislation]] that infringe on civil liberties.

In addition to representing persons and organizations in lawsuits, the ACLU lobbies for policies that have been established by its board of directors. Current positions of the ACLU include: opposing the [[death penalty]]; supporting [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|gay marriage]] and the [[LGBT adoption|right of gays to adopt]]; supporting [[Reproductive rights|birth control and abortion rights]]; eliminating discrimination against women, minorities, and gays; supporting the rights of prisoners and opposing torture; supporting the right of religious persons to practice their faiths without government interference; and opposing any government preference for religion over non-religion, or for particular faiths over others.

==Organization==
===Leadership===
[[File:ACLU Anthony D Romero.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Anthony D. Romero]] has been executive director since 2001.]]

The ACLU is led by an executive officer and a president ([[Anthony Romero]] and [[Susan Herman]], respectively, in 2011). The executive officer acts as chairman of the ACLU's board of directors, and is responsible for fundraising and facilitating policy-setting. The president manages the day-to-day operations of the organization.<ref>[http://www.aclu.org/about/staff/13279res20030205.html "Anthony D. Romero, Executive Director"], ACLU profile (last visited January 6, 2008).</ref><ref>[http://www.aclu.org/about/staff/37172res20081018.html "Susan Herman, President of the ACLU "], ACLU profile (last visited October 22, 2008).</ref> The board of directors consists 80 persons, including representatives from each state affiliate, as well as at-large delegates.

The leadership of the ACLU does not always agree on policy decisions: Differences of opinion within the ACLU leadership have sometimes grown into major debates. In 1937, an internal debate erupted over whether to defend Henry Ford's right to distribute anti-union literature.<ref name=W102/> In 1939, a heated debate took place over whether to prohibit communists from serving in ACLU leadership roles.<ref name=W1323/> During the early 1950s the board was divided on whether to defend communists persecuted under McCarthyism.<ref name=W176201/> In 1968, a schism formed over whether to represent Dr. Spock's anti-war activism.<ref name=W2845/> In 1973, there was internal conflict over whether to call for the impeachment of Richard Nixon.<ref name=W2924/> In 2005, there was internal conflict about whether or not a [[gag rule]] should be imposed on ACLU employees to prevent publication of internal disputes.<ref>Sherman, Scott, [http://www.thenation.com/article/aclu-v-aclu "ACLU v. ACLU"], ''The Nation'', January 18, 2007.</ref>

===Funding===
The ACLU consists of two separate non-profit organizations: the ACLU, and the ACLU Foundation. Both organizations engage in litigation, advocacy of civil rights, and education. The ACLU is a [[501(c)(4)]] corporation which also engages in political [[lobbying]], and donations to that component of the ACLU are not tax deductible. The ACLU Foundation is a [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit corporation, which does not engage in lobbying, and donations to it are tax deductible.<ref name="nonprofit">{{cite web | title=ACLU and ACLU Foundation: What Is the Difference?

|url = http://www.aclu.org/acluf.html | accessdate =September 5, 2007}}</ref>

In 2011, the ACLU and the ACLU Foundation had a combined income of $109 million, originating from grants (60%), membership donations (23%), and bequests (17%). Membership dues account for $25 million per year and are treated as donations; members choose the amount they pay annually, averaging $50 per member per year.<ref>[http://action.aclu.org/site/PageServer?pagename=finances&cr=1 2011 ACLU finance statement]. Retrieved January 31, 2011. 23% of $109 million is $25 million from 500,000 members. Membership fee is not fixed: member donate an amount of their choosing.</ref> In 2011, the combined expenses of the ACLU and ACLU Foundation were $106 million, spent on Programs (88%), management (7%), and fundraising (5%).<ref>[http://www.aclu.org/finances Finances | American Civil Liberties Union]</ref> The ACLU Foundation accounts for about 75% of the combined budget, and the ACLU about 25%.<ref>[http://www.aclu.org/node/20481] ACLU 990 tax forms</ref>

The ACLU solicits donations to its charitable foundation. The ACLU is accredited by the [[Better Business Bureau]], and the [[Charity Navigator]] has ranked the ACLU with a four-star rating.<ref>[http://www.bbb.org/charity-reviews/national/civil-rights/american-civil-liberties-union-foundation-in-new-york-ny-227 Charity Review of American Civil Liberties Union Foundation]</ref><ref>[http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=3247 Charity Navigator Rating - American Civil Liberties Union Foundation]</ref> The local affiliates also solicit their own funding, and some receive funds from the national ACLU. The distribution and amount of funding for state affiliates varies from state to state. Smaller affiliates with fewer resources, such as that in Nebraska, receive subsidies from the national ACLU.

In October 2004, the ACLU rejected $1.5 million from both the [[Ford Foundation]] and [[Rockefeller Foundation]] because the Foundations had adopted language from the USA PATRIOT Act in their donation agreements, including a clause stipulating that none of the money would go to "underwriting terrorism or other unacceptable activities." The ACLU views this clause, both in Federal law and in the donors' agreements, as a threat to civil liberties, saying it is overly broad and ambiguous.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |title=A.C.L.U. Rejects Foundation Grants Over Terror Language |author=Stephanie Srom |date=October 19, 2004 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/19/national/19aclu.html}}</ref><ref>See Kaminer, pp. 68<U+2013>70 for a discussion of an internal scandal in which Romero was accused of attempting to accept the funds without disclosing the terms to the ACLU board.</ref>

Due to the nature of its legal work, the ACLU is often involved in litigation against governmental bodies, which are generally protected from adverse monetary judgments: a town, state or federal agency may be required to change its laws or behave differently, but not to pay monetary damages except by an explicit statutory waiver. In some cases, the law permits plaintiffs who successfully sue government agencies to collect money damages or other monetary relief. In particular, the [[Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act of 1976]] leaves the government liable in some civil rights cases. Fee awards under this civil rights statute are considered "equitable relief" rather than damages, and government entities are not immune from equitable relief.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sec_42_00001988----000-.html | title=Title 42 , Chapter 21, Subchapter I, <U+00A7> 1988. Proceedings in vindication of civil rights}}</ref> Under laws such as this, the ACLU and its state affiliates sometimes share in monetary judgments against government agencies. In 2006, the [[Veterans' Memorials, Boy Scouts, Public Seals, and Other Public Expressions of Religion Protection Act of 2006|Public Expressions of Religion Protection Act]] sought to prevent monetary judgments in the particular case of violations of church-state separation.<ref>Report No. 109-657, H.R. 2679, available at [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&docid=f:h2679rh.txt.pdf GPO].</ref>

The ACLU has received court awarded fees from opponents, for example, the Georgia affiliate was awarded $150,000 in fees after suing a county demanding the removal of a [[Ten Commandments]] display from its courthouse;<ref>ACLU Georgia Press Release, [http://www.acluga.org/press.releases/0507/barrow.county.html "Barrow County to Remove 10 Commandments Display"], July 19, 2007 (last visited Jan. 6, 2008).</ref> a second Ten Commandments case in the State, in a different county, led to a $74,462 judgment.<ref>ACLU Georgia, [http://www.acluga.org/docket.html "2007 Litigation & Advocacy Docket"] (last visited Jan. 6, 2008).</ref> The State of Tennessee was required to pay $50,000, the State of Alabama $175,000, and the State of Kentucky $121,500, in similar Ten Commandments cases.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2003/07/09/loc_kytencommandments09.html | title=State pays ACLU $121,500 in Ten Commandments fight}}</ref><ref>Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance, [http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_10cb.htm The Ten Commandments: Developments: Year 2002], ReligiousTolerance.org</ref>

===State affiliates===
[[File:howard-simon-ed-aclu-fl.jpg|thumb|Howard Simon, executive director of the Florida affiliate, joins in a protest of the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]] detentions with [[Amnesty International]].]]
Most of the organization<U+2019>s workload is performed by the 53 local affiliates. There is an affiliate in each state and in Puerto Rico. California has three affiliates.<ref name="affiliates">{{cite web | title=Local ACLU Affiliates |work = American Civil Liberties Union web site | publisher =ACLU |url = http://www.aclu.org/affiliates | accessdate =August 20, 2010}}</ref> The affiliates operate autonomously from the national organization: each affiliate has its own staff, executive director, board of directors, and budget. Each affiliate consists of two non-profit corporations: a [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] corporation that does not perform lobbying, and a [[501(c)#501(c)(4)|501(c)(4)]] corporation which is entitled to lobby.

ACLU affiliates are the basic unit of the ACLU's organization and engage in litigation, lobbying, and public education. For example, in a twenty-month period beginning January 2004, the ACLU's New Jersey chapter was involved in fifty-one cases according to their annual report<U+2014>thirty-five cases in state courts, and sixteen in [[United States federal courts|federal court]]. They provided legal representation in thirty-three of those cases, and served as amicus in the remaining eighteen. They listed forty-four volunteer attorneys who assisted them in those cases.

===Support and opposition===
The ACLU is supported by a variety of persons and organizations. There were over 500,000 members in 2011, and the ACLU annually receives thousands of grants from hundreds of charitable foundations. Allies of the ACLU in legal actions include the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], the [[American Jewish Congress]], [[People For the American Way]], the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]], and the [[National Organization for Women]].

The ACLU has been criticized by liberals, such as when it excluded communists from its leadership ranks, when it defended [[Neo-Nazis]], when it declined to defend [[Paul Robeson]], or when it opposed the passage of the [[National Labor Relations Act]].<ref>Finan, Christopher M. (2007), ''From the Palmer Raids to the Patriot Act: a history of the fight for free speech in America'', Beacon Press, pp. 158<U+2013>159. (Robeson)</ref><ref name=Skokie/> Conversely, the ACLU has been criticized by conservatives, such as when it argued against prayer in schools, or when it opposed the Patriot Act.<ref>Walker, pp. 219<U+2013>220 (prayer in school).</ref> The ACLU has supported conservative figures such as [[Rush Limbaugh]], [[George Wallace]], [[Henry Ford]], and [[Oliver North]]; and it has supported liberal figures such as [[Dick Gregory]], [[H. L. Mencken]], [[Rockwell Kent]], and [[Dr. Benjamin Spock]].<ref name=FOXRush/><ref>Walker p 242 (Wallace).</ref><ref>Walker, p. 103. (Ford)</ref><ref>Walker, p. 375.

A major source of criticism are legal cases in which the ACLU represents an individual or organization that promotes offensive or unpopular viewpoints, such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]], [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazis]], the [[Nation of Islam]], the [[North American Man/Boy Love Association]], or the [[Westboro Baptist Church]]. The ACLU responded to these criticisms by stating "It is easy to defend freedom of speech when the message is something many people find at least reasonable. But the defense of freedom of speech is most critical when the message is one most people find repulsive."<ref>[http://www.aclu.org/free-speech/aclu-statement-defending-free-speech-unpopular-organizations ACLU Statement on Defending Free Speech of Unpopular Organizations], August 31, 2000. Retrieved January 19, 2012.</ref>

==Early years==
===CLB era===
[[File:CrystalEastman.jpeg|thumb|left|160px|[[Crystal Eastman]] was one of the co-founders of the CLB, the predecessor to the ACLU.]]
The predecessor to the ACLU was the [[National Civil Liberties Bureau]] (CLB).<ref>Walker, p. 17.</ref> The CLB was founded by [[Crystal Eastman]] and Roger Baldwin in 1917.<ref>Walker, p 20.</ref> Supporters of the CLB generally fell into one of three groups: social reformers, Protestant clergy, and conservative lawyers.<ref>Walker, p. 21.</ref> In 1918, Baldwin became the primary leader of the CLB, as Eastman succumbed to ill health.<ref>Walker, p 30.</ref>

The focus of the CLB was on freedom of speech, primarily anti-war speech, and on supporting [[conscientious objectors]] who wished to avoid serving in [[World War I]].<ref>Walker, pp. 23<U+2013>24, 30.</ref> Three Supreme Court decisions in 1919 each upheld convictions outlawing certain kinds of anti-war speech. In 1919, Socialist party leader [[Schenck v. United States|Charles Schenck's conviction]] for publishing anti-war literature was upheld by the Supreme Court.<ref>Walker, p. 26.</ref> Then, in ''[[Debs v. United States]],'' the court upheld the conviction of [[Eugene Debs]]. But five months later, justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes]] wrote an important dissent in ''[[Abrams v. United States]]'', in which he urged the court to treat freedom of speech as a fundamental right, which should only rarely be outlawed.<ref>Walker, p 27.</ref>

After taking over leadership of the CLB, Baldwin insisted that the organization be reorganized, and change its focus from litigation to direct action and public education.<ref name=W47>Walker, p. 47.</ref> The CLB directors concurred, and on January 19, 1920, the ACLU was formed.<ref name=W47/> Although there were a handful of other organizations in the United States at that time that focused on civil rights, such as the [[NAACP]] and [[Anti-Defamation League]], the ACLU was the first that did not limit itself to a particular group of persons, or to a single theme.<ref name=W47/>

During its first decades of its existence, [[Roger Nash Baldwin|Baldwin]] continued to be the leader of the ACLU. His charisma and energy attracted many supporters to ACLU leadership ranks.<ref>Walker, p 66.</ref> Baldwin was a very ascetic individual, who wore hand-me-down clothes, pinched pennies, and lived on a very small salary.<ref name="Walker">Walker, p 70.</ref> The ACLU was directed by an executive committee, but the committee was not particularly democratic or egalitarian: since the ACLU was headquartered in New York, the executive committee was dominated by New Yorkers.<ref>Walker, p 67.</ref> Most ACLU funding came from philanthropies, such as the [[Garland Fund]].<ref name="Walker" />

===Free speech era===

In the 1920s, government censorship was commonplace. Magazines were routinely confiscated under the anti-obscenity [[Comstock laws]]; permits for labor rallies were often denied; and virtually all anti-war or anti-government literature was outlawed.<ref name="Walker_a">Walker, p. 51<U+2013>52.</ref> Right-wing conservatives wielded vast amounts of power, and activists that promoted unionization, socialism, or government reform were often denounced as un-American or unpatriotic.<ref name="Walker_a" /> In one typical instance in 1923, author [[Upton Sinclair]] was arrested for trying to read the [[First Amendment]] during an [[Industrial Workers of the World]] rally.<ref name="Walker_b">Walker, p 52.</ref>
[[File:Norman Thomas 1937.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Norman Thomas]] was one of the early leaders of the ACLU.]]
ACLU leadership was divided on how to challenge the civil rights violations. One faction, including Baldwin, [[Arthur Garfield Hays]] and [[Norman Thomas]], believed that direct, militant action was the best path.<ref name="Walker_b" /> Hays was the first of many successful attorneys that relinquished their private practices to work for the ACLU.<ref name=W53>Walker, p 53.</ref> Another group, including [[Walter Nelles]] and [[Walter Pollak]] felt that lawsuits, taken to the Supreme Court, were the best way to achieve change.<ref name=W53/> Both groups worked in tandem, but they equally worshiped the Bill of Rights and the US Constitution.<ref name=W53/>

During the 1920s, the ACLU's primary focus was on freedom of speech in general, and speech within the labor movement particularly.<ref>Walker, p. 55</ref> Because most of the ACLU's efforts were associated with the labor movement, the ACLU itself came under heavy attack from conservative groups, such as the [[American Legion]], the [[National Civic Federation]], and [[Industrial Defense Association]] and the [[Allied Patriotic Societies]].<ref>Walker, p. 57.</ref>

In addition to labor, the ACLU also led efforts in non-labor arenas, for example, promoting free speech in public schools.<ref>Walker, p, 58.</ref> The ACLU itself was banned from speaking in New York public schools in 1921.<ref>Walker, p. 59.</ref> The ACLU, working with the [[NAACP]], also supported racial discrimination cases.<ref>Walker, p. 60.</ref> The ACLU defended free speech regardless of the opinions being espoused. For example, the reactionary, anti-Catholic, anti-black [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) was a frequent target of ACLU efforts, but the ACLU defended the KKK's right to hold meetings in 1923.<ref>Walker, p. 61.</ref> There were some civil rights that the ACLU did not make an effort to defend in the 1920s, including censorship of the arts, [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|government search and seizure]] issues, [[Privacy laws of the United States|right to privacy]], or [[wiretapping]].<ref>Walker, p 68.</ref>

The [[Communist Party USA|Communist party of the United States]] was routinely harassed and oppressed by government officials, leading it to be the primary client of the ACLU.<ref name=W63>Walker, p. 63.</ref> The Communists were very aggressive in their tactics, often engaging in illegal or unethical conduct, and this led to frequent conflicts between the Communists and the ACLU.<ref name=W63/> Communist leaders often attacked the ACLU, particularly when the ACLU defended the free speech rights of conservatives.<ref name=W63/> This uneasy relationship between the two groups continued for decades.<ref name=W63/>

===Scopes trial===
<!--[[File:Scopes trial.jpg|thumb|[[Clarence Darrow]], left, a member of the [[ACLU]], helped defend the Tennessee teacher in the [[Scopes trial]].]]-->
When 1925 arrived{{ndash}}five years after the ACLU was formed{{ndash}}the organization had virtually no success to show for its efforts.<ref>Walker, p. 71.</ref> That changed in 1925, when the ACLU persuaded [[John T. Scopes]] to defy Tennessee's anti-[[evolution]] law in a [[Scopes Trial|court test]]. [[Clarence Darrow]], a member of the ACLU National Committee, headed Scopes' legal team. The prosecution, led by [[William Jennings Bryan]], contended that the Bible should be interpreted literally in teaching [[creationism]] in school. The ACLU lost the case and Scopes was fined $100. The Tennessee Supreme Court later upheld the law but overturned the conviction on a technicality.<ref>University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law, [http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/scopes.htm "''Tennessee v. John Scopes'': The 'Monkey Trial' (1925)"], ''Famous Trials in American History'', last updated April 25, 2005 (last visited Jan. 7, 2008).</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/scopeschrono.html | title=The Evolution-Creationism Controversy: A Chronology}}</ref>

The Scopes trial was a phenomenal public relations success for the ACLU.<ref>Walker, p 73.</ref> The ACLU became well known across America, and the case led to the first endorsement of the ACLU by a major U.S. newspaper.<ref>Walker, p 75. The newspaper was the ''St. Louis Post Dispatch''.</ref> The ACLU continued to fight for the separation of church and state in schoolrooms, decade after decade, including the 1982 case ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' and the 2005 case ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]''.<ref>Berkman, Michael (2010), ''Evolution, Creationism, and the Battle to Control America's Classrooms'', Cambridge University Press, pp. 100<U+2013>101.</ref>

Baldwin himself was involved an important free speech victory of the 1920s, after he was arrested for attempting to speak at a rally of striking mill workers in New Jersey. Although the decision was limited to the state of New Jersey, the appeals court's judgement in 1928 declared that constitutional guarantees of free speech must be given "liberal and comprehensive construction", and it marked a major turning point in the civil rights movement, signaling the shift of judicial opinion in favor of civil rights.<ref>Walker, pp 78<U+2013>79. The case was in New Jersey: ''State v. Butterworth''. Decision quoted by Walker.</ref>

The most important ACLU case of the 1920s was ''[[Gitlow v. New York]]'', in which [[Benjamin Gitlow]] was arrested for violating a state law against inciting anarchy and violence, when he distributed literature promoting communism.<ref>Walker. p 79.</ref> Although the Supreme Court did not overturn Gitlow's conviction, it adopted the ACLU's stance (later termed the [[incorporation doctrine]]) that the First Amendment freedom of speech applied to state laws, as well as federal laws.<ref>Walker. p 80.</ref>

===First Victories===
Leaders of the ACLU were divided on the best tactics to use to promote civil liberties. [[Felix Frankfurter]] felt that legislation was the best long-term solution, because the Supreme Court could not (and{{ndash}}in his opinion{{ndash}}should not) mandate liberal interpretations of the Bill of Rights. But [[Walter Pollack]], [[Morris Ernst]], and other leaders felt that Supreme Court decisions were the best path to guarantee civil liberties.<ref>Walker, p 81</ref> A series of Supreme Court decisions in the 1920s foretold of a changing national atmosphere: anti-radical emotions were diminishing, and there was a growing willingness to protect freedom of speech and assembly via court decisions.<ref>Walker, p. 82. The cases included Gitlow (1925), Whitney ( 1927), Powell (1932) and Patterson (1935).</ref>

===Free speech===
[[File:H l mencken.jpg|thumb|right|160px|The ACLU defended [[H. L. Mencken]] when he was arrested for distributing banned literature.]]
Censorship was commonplace in the early 20th century. State laws and city ordinances routinely outlawed speech deemed to be obscene or offensive, and prohibited meetings or literature that promoted unions or labor organization.<ref name=W82>Walker, p 82.</ref> Starting in 1926, the ACLU began to expand its free speech activities to encompass censorship of art and literature.<ref name=W82/> In that year, [[H. L. Mencken]] deliberately broke Boston law by distributing copies of his banned ''[[American Mercury]]'' magazine; the ACLU defended him and won an acquittal.<ref name=W82/> The ACLU went on to win additional victories, including the landmark case ''[[United States v. One Book Called Ulysses]]'' in 1933, which reversed a ban by the Customs Department against the book ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by [[James Joyce]].<ref name=W86>Walker, p. 86.</ref> The ACLU only achieved mixed results in the early years, and it was not until 1966 that the Supreme Court finally clarified the obscenity laws in the ''[[Roth v. United States]]'' and ''[[Memoirs v. Massachusetts]]'' cases.

The [[Comstock laws]] banned distribution of sex education information, based on the premise that it was obscene and led to promiscuous behavior<ref name=W85>Walker, p. 85.</ref> [[Mary Ware Dennett]] was fined $300 in 1928, for distributing a pamphlet containing sex education material. The ACLU, led by Morris Ernst, appealed her conviction and won a reversal, in which judge [[Learned Hand]] ruled that the pamphlet's main purpose was to "promote understanding".<ref name=W85/>

The success prompted the ACLU to broaden their freedom of speech efforts beyond labor and political speech, to encompass movies, press, radio and literature.<ref name=W85/> The ACLU formed the [[National Committee on Freedom from Censorship]] in 1931 to coordinate this effort.<ref name=W85/> By the early 1930s, censorship in the United States was diminishing.<ref name=W86/>

Two major victories in the 1930s cemented the ACLUs campaign to promote free speech. In ''[[Stromberg v. California]]'', decided in 1931, the Supreme Court sided with the ACLU and affirmed the right of a communist party member to salute a communist flag. The result was the first time the Supreme Court used the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th amendment]] to subject states to the requirements of the [[first amendment]].<ref>Walker, p. 90</ref> In ''[[Near v. Minnesota]]'', also decided in 1931, the Supreme Court ruled that states may not exercise [[prior restraint]] and prevent a newspaper from publishing, simply because the newspaper had a reputation for being scandalous.<ref>Walker, p. 91.</ref>

==1930s==
The late 1930s saw the emergence of a new era of tolerance in the United States.<ref name=W112>Walker, p. 112</ref> National leaders hailed the [[Bill of Rights]], particularly as it protected minorities, as the essence of democracy.<ref name=W112/> The 1939 Supreme Court decision in ''[[Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization]]'' affirmed the right of communists to promote their cause.<ref name=W112/> Even conservative elements, such as the [[American Bar Association]] began to campaign for civil liberties, which were long considered to be the domain of left-leaning organizations. By 1940, the ACLU had achieved many of the goals it set in the 1920s, and many of its policies were the law of the land.<ref name=W112/>

===Expansion===
In 1929, after the Scopes and Dennett victories, Baldwin perceived that there was vast, untapped support for civil liberties in the United States.<ref name=W86/> Baldwin proposed an expansion program for the ACLU, focusing on police brutality, Native American rights, African-American rights, censorship in the arts, and international civil liberties.<ref name=W86/> The board of directors approved Baldwin's expansion plan, except for the international efforts.<ref name=W87>Walker, p. 87.</ref>

The ACLU played a major role in passing the 1932 [[Norris <U+2013> La Guardia Act]], a federal law which prohibited employers from preventing employees from joining unions, and stopped the practice of outlawing strikes, unions, and labor organizing activities with the use of injunctions.<ref name=W87/> The ACLU also played a key role in initiating a nationwide effort to reduce misconduct (such as extracting false confessions) within police departments, by publishing the report [[Lawlessness in Law Enforcement]] in 1931, under the auspices of [[Herbert Hoover]]'s [[Wickersham Commission]].<ref name=W87/> In 1934, the ACLU lobbied for the passage of the [[Indian Reorganization Act]], which restored some autonomy to Native American tribes, and established penalties for kidnapping native American children.<ref name=W87/>

Although the ACLU deferred to the NAACP for litigation promoting civil liberties for African Americans, the ACLU did engage in educational efforts, and published ''Black Justice '' in 1931, a report which documented institutional racism throughout the South, including lack of voting rights, segregation, and discrimination in the justice system.<ref name=W88>Walker, p. 88.</ref> Funded by the [[Garland Fund]], the ACLU also participated in producing the influential [[Margold Report]], which outlined a strategy to fight for civil rights for blacks.<ref name=W89>Walker, p. 89.</ref><ref>The Margold Report was named after it principle author, Nathan Ross Margold, a white attorney</ref> The ACLU's plan was to demonstrate that the "[[separate but equal]]" policies governing the Southern discrimination were illegal because blacks were never, in fact, treated equally.<ref name=W89/>

===Depression era and the New Deal===
In 1932{{ndash}}twelve years after the ACLU was founded{{ndash}}it had achieved significant success: the Supreme Court had embraced the free speech principles espoused by the ACLU, and the general public was becoming more supportive of civil rights in general.<ref>Walker, p. 92.</ref> But the [[Great Depression]] brought new assaults on civil liberties: the year 1930 saw a large increase in the number of free speech prosecutions, a doubling of the number of lynchings, and all meetings of unemployed persons were banned in Philadelphia.<ref>Walker, p. 95.</ref>

The [[FDR|Franklin Delano Roosevelt administration]] proposed the [[New Deal]] to combat the depression. ACLU leaders were of mixed opinions about the New Deal, since many felt that it represented an increase in government intervention into personal affairs, and because the [[National Recovery Administration]] suspended anti-trust legislation.<ref name=W96>Walker, p. 96.</ref> Roosevelt was not personally interested in civil rights, but did appoint many civil libertarians to key positions, including Interior Secretary [[Harold L. Ickes|Harold Ickes]], a member of the ACLU.<ref name=W96/><ref name=W97>Walker, p. 97</ref>

The economic policies of the New Deal leaders were often aligned with ACLU goals, but social goals were not.<ref name=W97/> In particular, movies were subject to a barrage of local ordinances banning screenings that were deemed immoral or obscene.<ref name=W100>Walker, p. 100.</ref> Even public health films portraying pregnancy and birth were banned; as was ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine's April 11, 1938 issue which included photos of the birth process. The ACLU fought these bans, but did not prevail.<ref name=W99>Walker, p. 99<U+2013>100.</ref>

The Catholic church attained increasing political influence in the 1930s, and used its influence to promote censorship of movies, and to discourage publication of birth control information. This conflict between the ACLU and the Catholic church led to the resignation of the last Catholic priest from ACLU leadership in 1934; a Catholic priest would not be represented there again until the 1970s.<ref name=W98>Walker, p. 98.</ref>

The ACLU took no official position on  president Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 1937 [[court-packing plan]], which threatened to increase the number of Supreme Court justices, unless the Supreme Court reversed its course and began approving New Deal legislation.<ref name=W105>Walker, p. 105<U+2013>106.</ref> The Supreme Court responded by making a [[The switch in time that saved nine|major shift in policy]], and no longer applied strict constitutional limits to government programs, and also began to take a more active role in protecting civil liberties.<ref name=W105/>

The first decision that marked the court's new direction was ''[[De Jonge v. Oregon]]'', in which a communist labor organizer was arrested for calling a meeting to discuss unionization.<ref name=W106>Walker, p. 106.</ref> The ACLU attorney [[Osmond Fraenkel]], working with [[International Labor Defense]], defended De Jonge in 1937, and won a major victory when the Supreme Court ruled that "peaceable assembly for lawful discussion cannot be made a crime."<ref>Court decision quoted by Walker, p. 106.</ref> The De Jong case marked the start of an era lasting for a dozen years, during which Roosevelt appointees (led by [[Hugo Black]], [[William O. Douglas]], and [[Frank Murphy]]) established a body of civil liberties law.<ref name=W106/> In 1938, Justice [[Harlan F. Stone]] wrote the famous "footnote four" in ''[[United States v. Carolene Products Co.]]'' in which he suggested that state laws which impede civil liberties would{{ndash}}henceforth{{ndash}}require compelling justification.<ref name=W107>Walker, p. 107.</ref>

Senator [[Robert F. Wagner]] proposed the [[National Labor Relations Act]] in 1935, which empowered workers to unionize. Ironically, the ACLU, after 15 years of fighting for workers rights, initially opposed the act (it later took no stand on the legislation) because some ACLU leaders feared the increased power the bill gave to the government.<ref name=W101>Wagner, p. 101.</ref> The newly formed [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) posed a dilemma for the ACLU, because in 1937 it issued an order to [[Henry Ford]], prohibiting Ford from disseminating anti-union literature.<ref name=W102>Walker, pp. 102<U+2013>103.</ref> Part of the ACLU leadership habitually took the side of labor, and that faction supported the NLRB's action.<ref name=W102/> But part of the ACLU supported Ford's right to free speech.<ref name=W102/> ACLU leader [[Arthur Garfield Hays]] proposed a compromise (supporting the auto workers union, yet also endorsing Ford's right to express personal opinions), but the schism highlighted a deeper divide that would become more prominent in the years to come.<ref name=W102/>

The ACLU's support of the NRLB was a major development for the ACLU, because it marked the first time it accepted that a government agency could be responsible for upholding civil liberties.<ref name=W103>Walker, p. 103.</ref> Until 1937, the ACLU felt that civil rights were best upheld by citizens and private organizations.<ref name=W103/>

Some factions in the ACLU proposed new directions for the organization. In the late 1930s, some local affiliates proposed shifting their emphasis from civil liberties appellate actions, to becoming a legal aid society, centered on store front offices in low income neighborhoods. The ACLU directors rejected that proposal.<ref name=W104>Walker, p. 104.</ref> Other ACLU members wanted the ACLU to shift focus into the political arena, and to be more willing to compromise their ideals in order to strike deals with politicians. This initiative was also rejected by the ACLU leadership.<ref name=W104/>

===Jehovah's Witnesses===
The ACLU's support of defendants with unpopular, sometimes extreme, viewpoints have produced many landmark court cases and established new civil liberties.<ref name=W107/> One such defendant was the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], who were involved in a [[United States Supreme Court cases involving Jehovah's Witnesses|large number of Supreme Court cases]].<ref name=W107/><ref>The ACLU was not the primary legal representative; the Witnesses had their own legal team, led by [[Hayden C. Covington]] during this era.</ref> Cases that the ACLU supported included ''[[Lovell v. Griffin]]'' (which struck down a city ordinance required a permit before a person could distribute "literature of any kind"); ''[[Martin v. Struthers]]'' (struck down an ordinance prohibiting door-to-door canvassing); and ''[[Cantwell v. Connecticut]]'' (which reversed the conviction of a Witness that was reciting offensive speech on a street corner).<ref name=W108>Walker, p. 108.</ref>

The most important cases involved statutes requiring flag salutes.<ref name=W108/> The Jehovah's Witnesses felt that saluting a flag was contrary to the their religious beliefs. Two children were convicted in 1938 of not saluting the flag.<ref name=W108/> The ACLU supported their appeal to the Supreme Court, but the court affirmed the conviction, in 1940.<ref name=W109>Walker, p. 109.</ref> But three years later, in ''[[West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette]]'', the Supreme court reversed itself and wrote "If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein." To underscore its decision, the Supreme Court announced it on [[Flag Day (United States)|Flag Day]].<ref name=W109/><ref>Justice Robert Jackson quoted by Walker, p. 109.</ref>

===Communism and totalitarianism===

The rise of [[totalitarianism]] in Germany, Russia, and Italy during [[World War II]] had a tremendous impact on the civil liberties movement. On the one hand, the oppression of the totalitarian states put into sharp relief the virtue of freedom of speech and association in the United States; on the other hand, they prompted an anti-communist hysteria in America which eroded many civil liberties.<ref name=W115>Walker, p. 115.</ref>

The ACLU leadership was divided over whether or not to defend pro-[[Nazi]] speech in the United States: pro-labor elements within the ACLU were hostile towards Nazism and fascism, and objected when the ACLU defended Nazis.<ref name=W116>Walker, p. 116<U+2013>117.</ref> Several states passed laws outlawing the hate speech directed at ethnic groups.<ref name=W117>Walker, p. 117.</ref> The first person arrested under New Jersey's 1935 hate speech law was a Jehovah's Witness who was charged with disseminating anti-Catholic literature.<ref name=W117/> The ACLU defended the Jehovah's Witnesses, and the charges were dropped.<ref name=W117/> The ACLU proceeded to defend numerous pro-Nazi groups, defending their rights to free speech and free association.<ref>Walker, pp. 117<U+2013>118.</ref>
[[File:Elizabeth Gurley Flynn point.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Elizabeth Flynn]] was voted off the ACLU board in 1940, for her leftist views, but reinstated posthumously in 1970.]]
In the late 1930s, the ACLU allied itself with the [[Communist Party of the United States#The Popular Front (1935<U+2013>1939)|Popular Front]], a coalition of liberal organizations coordinated by the [[Communist Party USA|United States Communist Party]].<ref name=W118>Walker, p. 118.</ref> The ACLU benefited because affiliates from the Popular Front could often fight local civil rights battles much more effectively than the New York-based ACLU.<ref name=W118/> The association with the Communist Party led to accusations that the ACLU was a "communist front", particularly because [[Harry F. Ward]] was both chairman of the ACLU and chairman of the [[American League Against War and Fascism]], a communist organization.<ref name=W119>Walker, p. 119.</ref>

The [[House Unamerican Activities Committee]] (HUAC) was created in 1938 to uncover sedition and treason within the United States.<ref name=W120>Walker, p. 120.</ref> When witnesses testified at its hearings, the ACLU was mentioned several times, leading the HUAC to mention the ACLU prominently in its 1939 report.<ref name=W121>Walker, p. 121.</ref> This damaged the ACLU's reputation severely, even though the report said that it could not "definitely state whether or not" the ACLU was a communist organization.<ref name=W121/>

While the ACLU rushed to defend its image against allegations of being a communist front, it also worked to protect witnesses who were being harassed by the HUAC.<ref name=W122>Walker, p. 122.</ref> The ACLU was one of the few organizations to protest (unsuccessfully) against passage of the [[Smith Act]] in 1940, which would later be used to imprison many persons who supported Communism.<ref name=W123>Walker, p. 123.</ref><ref>The Smith Act was ruled unconstitutional in 1957.</ref> The ACLU defended many persons who were prosecuted under the Smith Act, including labor leader [[Harry Bridges]].<ref name=W133>Walker, p. 133.</ref>

ACLU leadership was split on whether to purge its leadership of communists. [[Norman Thomas]], [[John Haynes Holmes]], and [[Morris Ernst]] were anti-communists that wanted to distance the ACLU from communism; opposing them were [[Harry F. Ward|Harry Ward]], [[Corliss Lamont]] and [[Elizabeth Flynn]] who rejected any political test for ACLU leadership.<ref name=W128>Walker, p. 128.</ref> A bitter struggle ensued throughout 1939, and the anti-communists prevailed in February 1940, when the board voted to prohibit anyone who supported totalitarianism from ACLU leadership roles. Chairman Harry Ward immediately resigned, and{{ndash}}following a contentious six hour debate{{ndash}}legendary activist Elizabeth Flynn was voted off the ACLU's board.<ref name=W1323>Walker, pp. 132<U+2013>133.</ref> The 1940 resolution was a disaster for the ACLU, and considered by many to be a betrayal of its fundamental principles. The resolution was rescinded in 1968, and Flynn was posthumously reinstated to the ACLU in 1970.<ref name=W133/>

==Mid century==
===World War II===
When World War II engulfed the United States, the Bill of Rights was enshrined as a hallowed document, and numerous organizations defended civil liberties.<ref name=W140>Walker, p. 140.</ref> Chicago and New York proclaimed "Civil Rights" weeks, and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt announced a national Bill of Rights day. [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] was the keynote speaker at the 1939 ACLU convention.<ref name=W140/> In spite of this newfound respect for civil rights, Americans were becoming adamantly anti-communist, and believed that excluding communists from American society was an essential step to preserve democracy.<ref name=W140/>
[[File:Japanese American Internment - Members of the Mochida Family Awaiting Evacuation 1942.gif|thumb|left|220px|The ACLU defended the rights of American citizens of Japanese ancestry, such as the Mochida family, when they were [[Japanese American internment|forcibly re-located to internment camps]].]]
Contrasted with World War I, there was relatively little violation of civil liberties during World War II. President Roosevelt was a strong supporter of civil liberties, but{{ndash}}more importantly{{ndash}}there were few anti-war activists during World War II.<ref name=W135>Walker, p. 135.</ref> The most significant civil rights issue during the war was the [[Japanese American internment|internment of Japanese-Americans]].<ref name=W135/> Two months after [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]], Roosevelt authorized the detention of all Japanese-Americans in internment camps. In addition to encompassing Japanese citizens, it also swept up American citizens of Japanese ancestry.<ref name=W137>Walker, p. 137.</ref> The ACLU immediately protested to Roosevelt, comparing the evacuations to Nazi concentration camps.<ref name=W138>Walker, p. 138.</ref> Not all ACLU leaders wanted to defend the Japanese-Americans: Roosevelt loyalists such as Morris Ernst wanted to support Roosevelt's war effort, but pacifists such as Baldwin and Norman Thomas felt that the Japanese-Americans needed individual due process hearings before they were imprisoned.<ref name=W139>Walker, p. 139.</ref> The ACLU was the only major organization that objected to the internment plan,<ref name=W135/> and their position was very unpopular. ACLU attorney [[A. L. Wirin]] lost private clients because of his defense of Japanese-Americans.<ref>Walker, p. 142.</ref>

The ACLU wanted a test case to take to court, but they had a difficult time finding a Japanese-American who would violate the internment order: of the 120,000 Japanese-Americans affected by the order, only 12 disobeyed; the cases of four of those resisters eventually made it to the Supreme Court.<ref name=W138/> The ACLU managed two of those cases. In early 1943, the Supreme court, in ''[[Hirabayashi v. United States]]'', upheld the government's right to intern the Japanese-Americans.<ref>Walker, p. 145.</ref> In late 1944, the second case ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'', also upheld the government's right to relocate the Japanese-Americans.<ref>Walker, pp. 146<U+2013>147.</ref> Their convictions were later overturned in the 1980s.<ref>Chin, Steven A. ''When Justice Failed : The Fred Korematsu Story'', Raintree, 1992, p. 95.</ref>

Although the ACLU defended the Japanese-Americans, it was more reluctant to defend anti-war protestors. A majority of the board passed a resolution in 1942 which declared the ACLU unwilling to defend anyone who interfered with the United State's war effort.<ref>Walker, p. 157.</ref>

When the war ended in 1945, the ACLU was 25 years old, and had accumulated an impressive set of legal victories.<ref name=W186>Walker, p. 186.</ref> President [[Harry S. Truman]] sent a congratulatory telegram to the ACLU on the occasion of their 25th anniversary.<ref name="W186"/> American attitudes had changed since World War I, and dissent by minorities was tolerated with more willingness.<ref name="W186"/> The Bill of Rights was more respected, and minority rights were becoming more commonly championed.<ref name="W186"/> During their 1945 annual conference, the ACLU leaders composed a list of important civil rights issues to focus on in the future, and the list included racial discrimination and separation of church and state.<ref>Walker, pp. 168-169.</ref>

The ACLU supported the African-American defendants in ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'', when they tried to occupy a house they had purchased in a neighborhood which had racially restrictive housing covenants. The African-American purchasers won the case in 1945.<ref>Walker, p. 164.</ref>

===Cold war era===
Anti-communist sentiment gripped the United States during the [[Cold War]] beginning in 1946. Federal investigations caused many persons with communist or left-leaning affiliations to lose their jobs, become blacklisted, or be jailed.<ref>Walker, pp. 173<U+2013>175.</ref> During the Cold War, although the United States collectively ignored the civil rights of communists, other civil liberties<U+2013>such as due process in law and separation of church and state<U+2013>continued to be reinforced and even expanded.

The ACLU was internally divided when it purged communists from its leadership in 1940, and that ambivalence continued as it decided whether to defend alleged communists during the late 1940s. Some ACLU leaders were anti-communist, and felt that the ACLU should not defend any victims. Some ACLU leaders felt that communists were entitled to free speech protections, and the ACLU should defend them. Other ACLU leaders were uncertain about the threat posed by communists, and tried to establish a compromise between the two extremes.<ref>Walker, pp. 175<U+2013>176.</ref> This ambivalent state of affairs would last until 1954, when the civil liberties faction prevailed, leading to the resignation of most of the anti-communist leaders.<ref name=W176201>Walker, pp. 176, 210.</ref>

In 1947, president Truman issued [[Executive Order 9835]] which created the [[Federal Loyalty Program]]. This program authorized the Attorney General to create a list of organizations which were deemed to be subversive.<ref>walker, p. 176.</ref> Any association with these programs was ground for barring the person from employment.<ref name=W177>Walker, p. 177.</ref> Listed organizations were not notified that they were being considered for the list, nor did they have an opportunity to present counterarguments; nor did the government divulge any factual basis for inclusion in the list.<ref name=W179>Walker, p. 179</ref> Although ACLU leadership was divided on whether to challenge the Federal Loyalty Program, some challenges were successfully made.<ref name=W179/>

Also in 1947 the House Unamerican Activities Committee (HUAC) subpoenaed ten Hollywood directors and writers, the ''[[Hollywood Ten]]'', intending to ask them to identify Communists, but the witnesses refused to testify. All were imprisoned for [[contempt of Congress]]. The ACLU supported the appeals of several of the artists, but lost on appeal.<ref name=W181>Walker, p. 181.</ref> The Hollywood establishment panicked after the HUAC hearings, and created a [[blacklist]] which prohibited anyone with leftist associations from working. The ACLU supported legal challenges to the blacklist, but those challenges failed.<ref name=W181/> The ACLU was more successful with an education effort: the 1952 report ''The Judges and the Judged'', prepared at the ACLU's direction in response to the blacklisting of actress [[Jean Muir]], described the unfair and unethical actions behind the blacklisting process, and it helped gradually turn public opinion against McCarthyism.<ref>Walker, p. 183.</ref>
[[File:DennisEugene.jpg|thumb|left|160px|The ACLU chose to not support [[Eugene Dennis]] or other leaders of the U.S. Communist Party, and they were all imprisoned, along with their attorneys.]]
The federal government took direct aim at the U. S. communist party in 1948 when it indicted its top twelve leaders in the [[Foley Square trial]].<ref name=W185>Walker,p. 185.</ref> The case hinged on whether or not mere membership in a totalitarian political party was sufficient to conclude that members advocated the overthrow of the United States government.<ref name=W185/> The ACLU chose to not represent any of the defendants, and they were all found guilty and sentenced to three to five years in prison.<ref name=W185/> Their defense attorneys were all cited for contempt, went to prison and were disbarred.<ref name="W186" /> When the government indicted additional party members, the defendants could not find attorneys to represent them.<ref name="W186"/> Communists protested outside the courthouse, and a bill to outlaw picketing of courthouses was introduced in Congress, and the ACLU supported the anti-picketing law.<ref name="W186"/>

The ACLU, in a change of heart, supported the party leaders during their appeal process. The Supreme Court upheld the convictions in the [[Dennis v. United States]] decision by softening the free speech requirements from a "clear and present danger" test, to a "grave and probable" test.<ref name=W187>Walker, p 187.</ref> The ACLU issued a public condemnation of the ''Dennis'' decision, and resolved to fight it.<ref name=W187/> One reason for the Supreme Court's support of cold war legislation was the 1949 deaths of Supreme Court justices [[Frank Murphy]] and [[Wiley Rutledge]], leaving [[Hugo Black]] and [[William O. Douglas]] as the only remaining civil libertarians on the Court.<ref name="Walker_c">Walker, p. 195.</ref>

The ''Dennis'' decision paved the way for the prosecution of hundreds of other communist party members.<ref name=W188>Walker, p. 188.</ref> The ACLU supported many of the communists during their appeals (although most of the initiative originated with local ACLU affiliates, not the national headquarters) but most convictions were upheld.<ref name=W188/> The two California affiliates, in particular, felt the national ACLU headquarters was not supporting civil liberties strongly enough, and they initiated more cold war cases than the national headquarters did.<ref name="Walker_c" />

The ACLU also challenged many loyalty oath requirements across the country, but the courts upheld most of the loyalty oath laws.<ref>Walter, pp. 188<U+2013>189.</ref> California ACLU affiliates successfully challenged the California state loyalty oath.<ref>Walker, p 190. The case was ''[[Speiser v. Randall]]''.</ref> The Supreme Court, until 1957, upheld nearly every law which restricted the liberties of communists.<ref>Walker, photo caption of Flynn, page following 214.</ref>

The ACLU, even though it scaled back its defense of communists during the Cold War, still came under heavy criticism as a "front" for communism. Critics included the [[American Legion]], senator [[Joseph McCarthy]], the HUAC, and the FBI.<ref>Walker, pp. 193, 195<U+2013>196.</ref> Several ACLU leaders were sympathetic to the FBI, and as a consequence, the ACLU rarely investigated any of the many complaints about the FBI's abuse of power during the Cold War.<ref>Walker, pp. 191<U+2013>193.</ref>

===Organizational change===
In 1950, the ACLU board of directors asked executive director Baldwin to resign, feeling that he lacked the organizational skills to lead the 9,000 (and growing) member organization. Baldwin objected, but a majority of the board elected to remove him from the position, and he was replaced by [[Patrick Murphy Malin]].<ref>Walker, pp. 205<U+2013>206.</ref> Under Malin<U+2019>s guidance, membership tripled to 30,000 by 1955{{ndash}}the start of a 24 year period of continual growth leading to 275,000 members in 1974. .<ref name=W207>Walker, p 207.</ref> Malin also presided over an expansion of local ACLU affiliates.<ref name=W207/>

The ACLU, which had been controlled by an elite of a few dozen New Yorkers, became more democratic in the 1950s. In 1951, the ACLU amended its bylaws to permit the local affiliates to participate directly in voting on ACLU policy decisions.<ref name=W208>Walker, p. 208.</ref> A bi-annual conference, open to the entire membership, was instituted in the same year, and in later decades it became a pulpit for activist members, who suggested new directions for the ACLU, including abortion rights, death penalty, and rights of the poor.<ref name=W208/>

===McCarthyism era===
[[File:Paul Robeson 1942 crop.jpg|thumb|left|160px|In the 1950s the ACLU chose to not support [[Paul Robeson]] and other leftist defendants, a decision that would be heavily criticized in the future.]]
During the early 1950s, the ACLU continued to steer a moderate course through the Cold War. When leftist singer [[Paul Robeson]] was denied a passport in 1950, even though he was not a communist and not accused of any illegal acts, the ACLU chose to not defend him.<ref>Walker, p. 199.</ref> The ACLU later reversed their stance, and supported [[William Worthy]] and [[Rockwell Kent]] in their passport confiscation cases, which resulted in legal victories in the late 1950s.<ref>Walker, p. 200.</ref>

In response to communist witch-hunts, many witnesses and employees chose to use the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|fifth amendment]] protection against [[self-incrimination]] to avoid divulging information about their political beliefs.<ref>Walker, p. 201.</ref> Government agencies and private organizations, in response, established polices which inferred communist party membership for anyone who invoked the fifth amendment.<ref>Walker, pp. 201<U+2013>202.</ref> The national ACLU was divided on whether to defend employees who had been fired merely for pleading the fifth amendment, but the New York affiliate successfully assisted teacher Harry Slochower in his Supreme Court case which reversed his termination.<ref>Walker, p. 202. The case was ''[[Slochower v. Board of Higher Education of New York City]]'', 350 U.S. 551 (1956).</ref>

The fifth amendment issue became the catalyst for a watershed event in 1954, which finally resolved the ACLU<U+2019>s ambivalence by ousting the anti-communists from ACLU leadership.<ref>Walker, pp. 208<U+2013>211.</ref> In 1953, the anti-communists, led by [[Norman Thomas]] and [[James Fly]], proposed a set of resolutions that inferred guilt of persons that invoked the fifth amendment.<ref name="W208" /> These resolutions were the first that fell under the ACLU<U+2019>s new organizational rules permitting local affiliates to participate in the vote; the affiliates outvoted the national headquarters, and rejected the anti-communist resolutions.<ref>Walker, p. 209.</ref> Anti-communists leaders refused to accept the results of the vote, and brought the issue up for discussion again at the 1954 bi-annual convention.<ref name=W210>Walker, p. 210.</ref> ACLU member [[Frank Porter Graham|Frank Graham]], president of the [[University of North Carolina]], attacked the anti-communists with a counter-proposal, which stated that the ACLU <U+201C>stand[s] against guilt by association, judgment by accusation, the invasion of privacy of personal opinions and beliefs, and the confusion of dissent with disloyalty.<U+201D><ref name=W210/><ref>Graham<U+2019>s proposal quoted in Walker</ref> The anti-communists continued to battle Graham<U+2019>s proposal, but were outnumbered by the affiliates. The anti-communists finally gave up and departed the board of directors in late 1954 and 1955, ending an eight year reign of ambivalence within the ACLU leadership ranks.<ref>Walker, pp. 210<U+2013>211.</ref> Thereafter, the ACLU proceeded with firmer resolve against Cold War anti-communist legislation.<ref name=W211>Walker, p. 211.</ref> The period from the 1940 resolution (and the purge of Elizabeth Flynn) to the 1954 resignation of the anti-communist leaders is considered by many to be an era in which the ACLU abandoned its core principles.<ref name=W211/><ref>[[Corliss Lamont]], in particular, portrayed that era as a major lapse of principle.</ref>

McCarthyism declined in late 1954 after television journalist [[Edward R. Murrow]] and others publicly chastised McCarthy.<ref name=W212>Walker, p. 212.</ref> The controversies over the Bill of Rights that were generated by the Cold War ushered in a new era in American Civil liberties. In 1954 in <U+2018><U+2019>[[Brown v. Board of Education]]<U+2019><U+2019>, the Supreme Court unanimously overturned state-sanctioned school segregation, and thereafter a flood of civil rights victories dominated the legal landscape.<ref>Walker, pp. 213<U+2013>214, 217<U+2013>218.</ref>

The supreme court handed the ACLU two key victories in 1957, in ''[[Watkins v. United States]]'' and ''[[Yates v. United States]]'', both of which undermined the [[Smith Act]] and marked the beginning of the end of communist party membership inquiries.<ref>Walker, pp 240<U+2013>242.</ref> In 1965, the Supreme Court produced some decisions, including ''[[Lamont v. Postmaster General]]'' (in which the plaintiff was [[Corliss Lamont]], a former ACLU board member), which upheld fifth amendment protections and brought an end to restrictions on political activity.<ref>Walker, p 246.</ref>

==1960s==
The decade from 1954 to 1964 was the most successful period in the ACLU<U+2019>s history.<ref name=W217>Walker, p. 217</ref> Membership rose from 30,000 to 80,000, and by 1965 it had affiliates in seventeen states.<ref name=W217/><ref>Membership numbers are from 1955 and 1965.</ref> During the ACLU<U+2019>s bi-annual conference in Colorado in 1964, the Supreme Court issued rulings on eight cases in which the ACLU was involved; the ACLU prevailed on seven of the eight.<ref name="Walker_d">Walker, p. 236.</ref> The ACLU played a role in Supreme Court decisions reducing censorship of literature and arts, protecting freedom of association, prohibiting racial segregation, excluding religion from public schools, and providing due process protection to criminal suspects.<ref name=W217/> The ACLU<U+2019>s success arose from changing public attitudes: the American populous was more educated, more tolerant, and more willing to accept unorthodox behavior.<ref name=W217/>

===Separation of church and state===
[[File:HugoLaFayetteBlack.jpg|thumb|160px|Supreme Court justice [[Hugo Black]] often endorsed the ACLU's position on the separation of church and state.]]
Legal battles concerning the separation of church and state originated in laws dating to 1938 which required religious instruction in school, or provided state funding for religious schools.<ref name=W219>Walker, p. 219</ref> The Catholic church was a leading proponent of such laws; and the primary opponents (the <U+201C>separationists<U+201D>) were the ACLU, [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]], and the [[American Jewish Congress]].<ref name=W219/> The ACLU led the challenge in the 1947 ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'' case, in which Justice Hugo Black wrote <U+201C>[t]he First Amendment has erected a wall between church and state<U+2026>. That wall must be kept high and impregnable.<U+201D><ref name=W219/><ref>Black quoted by Walker.</ref><ref>Black was paraphrasing Thomas Jefferson, who first employed the metaphor of a wall. Urofsky, Melvin, "Church and State", in Bodenhamer, p. 67.</ref> It was not clear that the Bill of Rights forbid state governments from supporting religious education, and strong legal arguments were made by religious proponents, arguing that the Supreme Court should not act as a <U+201C>national school board<U+201D>, and that the Constitution did not govern social issues.<ref name=W221>Walker, p. 221.</ref> However, the ACLU and other advocates of church/state separation persuaded the Court to declare such activities unconstitutional.<ref name=W221/> Historian [[Samuel Walker (historian)|Samuel Walker]] writes that the ACLU<U+2019>s <U+201C>greatest impact on American life<U+201D> was its role in persuading the Supreme Court to <U+201C>constitutionalize" so many public controversies.<ref name=W221/>

In 1948, the ACLU prevailed in the ''[[McCollum v. Board of Education]]'' case, which challenged public school religious classes taught by clergy paid for from private funds.<ref name=W221/> The ACLU also won cases challenging schools in New Mexico which were taught by clergy and had crucifixes hanging in the classrooms.<ref name=W222>Walker, p. 222.</ref> In the 1960s, the ACLU, in response to member insistence, turned its attention to in-class promotion of religion.<ref name=W223>Walker, p. 223</ref> In 1960, 42 percent of American schools included Bible reading.<ref>Walker, p 223.</ref> In 1962, the ACLU published a policy statement condemning in-school prayers, observation of religious holidays, and Bible reading.<ref name=W223/> The Supreme Court concurred with the ACLU<U+2019>s position, when it prohibited New York<U+2019>s in-school prayers in the 1962 ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'' decision.<ref>Walker, p. 224</ref> Religious factions across the country rebelled against the anti-prayer decisions, leading them to propose the [[School Prayer Amendment|School Prayer Constitutional Amendment]], which declared in-school prayer legal.<ref name=W225>Walker, p. 225.</ref> The ACLU participated in a lobbying effort against the amendment, and the 1966 congressional vote on the amendment failed to obtain the required two-thirds majority.<ref name=W225/>

Not all cases were victories: ACLU lost cases in 1949 and 1961 which challenged state laws requiring commercial businesses to close on Sunday, the Christian Sabbath.<ref name=W222/> The Supreme court has never overturned such laws, although some states subsequently revoked many of the laws under pressure from commercial interests.<ref name=W222/>

===Freedom of expression===

During the 1940s and 1950s, the ACLU continued its battle against censorship of art and literature.<ref name=W227>Walker, p. 227.</ref> In 1948, the New York affiliate of the ACLU received mixed results from the Supreme Court, winning the appeal of [[Carl Jacob Kunz]], who was convicted for speaking without a police permit, but losing the appeal of [[Irving Feiner]] who was arrested to prevent a breach of the peace, based on his oration denouncing president Truman and the American Legion.<ref name=W229>Walker, p 229.</ref> The ACLU lost the case of [[Joseph Beahharnais]], who was arrested for group libel when he distributed literature impugning the character of African Americans.<ref name=W230>Walker, p 230.</ref>

Cities across America routinely banned movies because they were deemed to be <U+201C>harmful<U+201D>, <U+201C>offensive<U+201D>, or <U+201C>immoral<U+201D>{{ndash}}censorship which was validated by the 1915 ''[[Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio|Mutual v. Ohio]]'' Supreme Court decision which held movies to be mere commerce, undeserving of first amendment protection.<ref name=W231>Walker, p. 231.</ref> The film ''[[L'Amore (film)|The Miracle]]'' was banned in New York in 1951, at the behest of the Catholic church, but the ACLU supported the film<U+2019>s distributor in an appeal of the ban, and won a major victory in the 1952 decision ''[[Joseph Burstyn, Inc v. Wilson]]''.<ref name=W231/> The Catholic church led efforts throughout the 1950s attempting to persuade local prosecutors to ban various books and movies, leading to conflict with the ACLU when the ACLU published it statement condemning the church<U+2019>s tactics.<ref name=W232>Walker, p. 232.</ref> Further legal actions by the ACLU successfully defended films such as ''[[M (1951 film)|M]]'' and ''[[La Ronde (1950 film)|la Ronde]]'', leading the eventual dismantling of movie censorship.<ref name=W231/><ref>Walker, p. 235.</ref> Hollywood continued employing self-censorship with its own [[Production Code]], but in 1956 the ACLU called on Hollywood to abolish the Code.<ref name=W233>Walker, p. 233.</ref>

The ACLU defended [[beat generation]] artists, including [[Allen Ginsburg]] who was prosecuted for his poem "[[Howl]]"; and{{ndash}}in an unorthodox case{{ndash}} the ACLU helped a coffee house regain its restaurant license which was revoked because its Beat customers were allegedly disturbing the peace and quiet of the neighborhood.<ref>Walker, pp 232<U+2013>233.</ref>

The ACLU lost an [[Roth v. United States|important press censorship case]] when, in 1957, the Supreme Court upheld the obscenity conviction of publisher [[Samuel Roth]] for distributing adult magazines.<ref>Walker, p. 234.</ref> As late as 1953, books such as ''[[Tropic of Cancer]]'' and ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' were still banned.<ref name=W227/> But public standards rapidly became more liberal though the 1960s, and obscenity was notoriously difficult to define, so by 1971 prosecutions for obscenity had halted.<ref name="Walker_d" /><ref name=W227/>

===Racial discrimination===

A major aspect of civil liberties progress after World War II was the undoing centuries of racism in federal, state, and local governments{{ndash}} an effort generally known as the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|Civil Rights Movement]].<ref name=W238>Walker, p. 238.</ref> Several civil liberties organizations worked together for progress, including the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), the ACLU, and the [[American Jewish Congress]].<ref name=W238/> The NAACP took primary responsibility for Supreme Court cases (often led by lead NAACP attorney [[Thurgood Marshall]]), with the ACLU focusing on police misconduct, and supporting the NAACP with [[amicus brief]]s.<ref name=W238/> The NAACP achieved a key victory in 1950 with the ''[[Henderson v. United States]]'' decision that ended segregation in interstate bus and rail transportation.<ref name=W238/>

In 1954, the ACLU filed an [[amicus brief]] in the case of ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', which led to the ban on racial segregation in U.S. [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]].<ref>ACLU, ''ACLU Amicus Brief in Brown v. Board of Education'', Oct. 11, 1952 ([http://www.aclu.org/racialjustice/gen/15901lgl19521011.html PDF brief]).</ref> Southern states instituted a McCarthyism-style witch-hunt against the NAACP, attempting it to disclose membership lists.  The ACLU's fight against racism was not limited to segregation: in 1964 the ACLU provided key support to plaintiffs, primarily lower income urban residents, in ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'', which required states to establish the voting districts in accordance with the "one person, one vote" principle.<ref>Walker, pp255<U+2013> 257.</ref>

===Police misconduct===
The ACLU regularly tackled police misconduct issues, starting with the 1932 case ''[[Powell v. Alabama]]'' (right to an attorney), and including 1942's ''[[Betts v. Brady]]'' (right to an attorney), and 1951's ''[[Rochin v. California]]'' (involuntary stomach pumping).<ref>Walker, p. 246.</ref> In the late 1940s, several ACLU local affiliates established permanent committees to address policing issues.<ref>Walker, p. 247.</ref> During the 1950s and 1960s, the ACLU was responsible for substantially advancing the legal protections against police misconduct.<ref>Walker, pp. 246<U+2013>250.</ref> The Philadelphia affiliate was responsible for causing the City of Philadelphia, in 1958, to create the nation's first civilian police review board.<ref>Walker, pp. 246<U+2013>248.</ref> In 1959, the Illinois affiliate published the first report in the nation, ''Secret Detention by the Chicago Police'', which documented unlawful detention by police.<ref>Walker, pp. 248<U+2013>249.</ref>

Some of the most well known ACLU successes came in the 1960s, when the ACLU prevailed in a string of cases limiting the power of police to gather evidence: In 1961's ''[[Mapp v. Ohio]]'', the Supreme court required states to obtain a warrant before searching a person's home.<ref>Walker, pp. 249<U+2013>251.</ref> The '' [[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'' decision in 1963 provided legal representation to indigents.<ref>Walker, pp. 252<U+2013>253.</ref> In 1964, the ACLU persuaded the Court, in [[Escobedo v. Illinois]], to permit suspects to have an attorney present during questioning.<ref>Walker, p. 250.</ref> And, in 1966, the ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'' decision required police to notify suspects of their constitutional rights.<ref>Walker, pp. 250<U+2013>251.</ref> Although many law enforcement officials criticized the ACLU for expanding the rights of suspects, police officers themselves took advantage of the ACLU. For example when the ACLU represented New York policemen in their lawsuit which objected to searches of their workplace lockers.<ref>Walker, p. 252.</ref> In the late 1960s, civilian review boards in New York and Philadelphia were abolished, over the ACLU<U+2019>s objection.<ref>Walker, p. 274.</ref>

===Civil liberties revolution of the 1960s===

The 1960s was a tumultuous era in the United States, and public interest in civil liberties underwent an explosive growth.<ref name="Walkerpp">Walker, pp. 257, 261<U+2013>262.</ref> Civil liberties actions in the 1960s were often led by young people, and often employed tactics such as [[sit in]]s and marches. Protests were often peaceful, but sometimes employed militant tactics.<ref>Walker, pp. 262<U+2013>264.</ref> The ACLU played a central role in all major civil liberties debates of the 1960s, including new fields such as [[gay rights]], [[prisoner's rights]], [[abortion]], [[rights of the poor]], and the [[death penalty]].<ref name="Walkerpp" /> Membership in the ACLU increased from 52,000 at the beginning of the decade, to 104,000 in 1970.<ref name=W262>Walker, p 262</ref> In 1960, there were affiliates in seven states, and by 1974 there were affiliates in 46 states.<ref name=W262/><ref>The count of affiliates is of affiliates with a permanent staff.</ref> During the 1960s, the ACLU underwent a major transformation tactics: it shifted emphasis from legal appeals (generally involving [[amicus briefs]] submitted to the Supreme Court) to direct representation of defendants when they were initially arrested.<ref name=W262/> At the same time, the ACLU transformed its style from "disengaged and elitist" to "emotionally engaged".<ref>Walker, p. 263. Characterizations by Samuel Walker.</ref> The ACLU published a breakthrough document in 1963, titled ''How Americans Protest'', which was borne of frustration with the slow progress in battling racism, and which endorsed aggressive, even militant protest techniques.<ref>Walker, pp. 263<U+2013>264.</ref>

African-American protests in the South accelerated in the early 1960s, and the ACLU assisted at every step. After four African-American college students [[Greensboro sit-ins|staged a sit-in]] in a segregated North Carolina department store, the sit-in movement gained momentum across the United States.<ref>Walker, p. 261.</ref> During 1960-61, the ACLU defended black students arrested for demonstrating in North Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana.<ref name=W263/> The ACLU also provided legal help for the [[Freedom riders|Freedom Rides]] in 1961, the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)#Integration of Mississippi universities, 1956<U+2013>1965|integration of the University of Mississippi]], the 1963 [[Birmingham campaign|protests in Birmingham, Alabama]], and the 1964 [[Freedom Summer]].<ref name=W263>Walker, p. 263.</ref>

The NAACP was responsible for managing most sit-in related cases that made it to the Supreme Court, winning nearly every decision.<ref name=W264>Walker, p. 264.</ref> But it fell to the ACLU and other legal volunteer efforts to provide legal representation to hundreds of protestors{{ndash}}white and black{{ndash}}who were arrested while protesting in the South.<ref name=W264/> The ACLU joined with other civil liberties groups to form the [[Lawyers Constitutional Defense Committee]] (LCDC) which subsequently provided legal representation to many of the protesters.<ref>Walker, pp. 264<U+2013>265.</ref> The ACLU provided the majority of the funding for the LCDC.<ref>Walker, p. 266.</ref>

In 1964, the ACLU opened up a major office in Atlanta, Georgia, dedicated to serving Southern issues.<ref>Walker, p. 267.</ref> Much of the ACLU's progress in the South was due to [[Charles Morgan, Jr.]], the charismatic leader of the Atlanta office. He was responsible for desegregating juries ([[Whitus v. Georgia]]), desegregating prisons (''[[Lee v. Washington]]''), and [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|reforming election laws]].<ref>Walker, pp. 268<U+2013>269.</ref> The ACLU's southern office also defended African-American congressman [[Julian Bond]] in ''[[Bond v. Floyd]]'', when the [[Georgia House of Representatives|Georgia congress]] refused to formally induct Bond into the legislature.<ref>Walker, pp 270<U+2013>271.</ref> Another widely publicized case defended by Morgan was that of Army doctor Howard Levy, who was convicted of refusing to train [[Green Berets]]. Despite raising the defense that the Green Berets were committing war crimes in Vietnam, Levy lost on appeal in ''Parker v. Levy'', 417 U.S. 733 (1974).<ref>Walker, p 271.</ref>

In 1969, the ACLU won a major victory for free speech, when it defended [[Dick Gregory]] after he was arrested for peacefully protesting against the mayor of Chicago. The court ruled in ''[[Gregory v. Chicago]]'' that a speaker cannot be arrested for disturbing the peace when the hostility is initiated by someone in the audience, as that would amount to a "heckler's veto".<ref>[http://www.aclu.org/successes-american-civil-liberties-union ACLU list of successes]; the case was Gregory v. Chicago, 394 U.S. 111</ref>

===Vietnam war===
[[File:MaryBethTinkerArmband.jpg|thumb|right|200|Thirteen year old Mary Beth Tinker and her brother John were suspended from school for wearing armbands protesting the Vietnam war. The ACLU took [[Tinker v. Des Moines|their case to the supreme court]] and won.]]
The ACLU was at the center of several legal aspects of the Vietnam war: defending [[draft resister]]s, challenging the constitutionality of the war, the [[Watergate scandal|potential impeachment of Richard Nixon]], and the use of national security concerns to preemptively [[Censorship|censor]] newspapers.

David J. Miller was the first person prosecuted for burning his [[draft card]]. The New York affiliate of the ACLU appealed his 1965 conviction (367 F.2d 72: ''United States of America v. David J. Miller'', 1966), but the Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal. Two years later, the Massachusetts affiliate took the card-burning case of David O<U+2019>Brien to the Supreme court, arguing that the act of burning was a form of symbolic speech, but the Supreme Court upheld the conviction in ''[[United States v. O'Brien]]'', 391 US 367 (1968).<ref name="Walker_e">Walker, p. 280.</ref> Thirteen year old Junior High student Mary Tinker wore a black armband to school in 1965 to object to the war, and was suspended from school. The ACLU appealed her case to the supreme court and won a victory in ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines]]''. This critical case established that the government may not establish <U+201C>enclaves<U+201D> such as schools or prisons where all rights are forfeit.<ref name="Walker_e" />
[[File:WCWProtest WashingtonDC.jpg|thumb|160px|left|The ACLU contends that the Bill of Rights protects individuals who burn the U.S. flag as a form of expression.]]
The ACLU defended Sydney Street, who was arrested for burning an American flag to protest the reported assassination of civil rights leader [[James Meredith]]. In the ''[[Street v. New York]]'' decision, the court agreed with the ACLU that encouraging the country to abandon one of its national symbols was constitutionally protected form of expression.<ref>Walker, p. 280. Meredith, in fact, was not assassinated.</ref> The ACLU successfully defended Paul Cohen, who was arrested for wearing a jacket with the words <U+201C>fuck the draft<U+201D> on its back, while he walked through the Los Angeles courthouse. The Supreme Court, in ''[[Cohen v. California]]'', held that the vulgarity of the wording was essential to convey the intensity of the message.<ref name=W281>Walker, p. 281.</ref>

Non-war related free speech rights were also advanced during the Vietnam war era: in 1969, the ACLU defended a [[Ku Klux Klan]] member who advocated long-term violence against the government, and the Supreme Court concurred with the ACLU's argument in the landmark decision ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'', which held that only speech which advocated ''imminent'' violence could be outlawed.<ref name=W281/>

A major crisis gripped the ACLU in 1968 when a debate erupted over whether to defend [[Dr. Benjamin Spock]] and the [[Boston Five]] against federal charges that they encouraged draftees to avoid the draft.<ref name=W2845>Walker, pp. 284<U+2013>285.</ref> The ACLU board was deeply split over whether to defend the activists: half the board harbored anti-war sentiments, and felt that the ACLU should lend its resources to the cause of the Boston Five.<ref name=W2845/> The other half of the board believed that civil liberties were not at stake, and the ACLU would be taking a political stance.<ref name=W2845/> Behind the debate was the longstanding ACLU tradition that it was politically impartial, and provided legal advice without regard to the political views of the defendants.<ref name=W2845/> The board finally agreed to a compromise solution that permitted the ACLU to defend the anti-war activists, without endorsing the activist's political views.<ref name=W2845/> Some critics of the ACLU suggest that the ACLU became a partisan political organization following the Spock case.<ref name=W2845/> After the [[Kent State shootings]] in 1970, ACLU leaders took another step towards politics by passing a resolution condemning the Vietnam war. The resolution was based in a variety of legal arguments, including civil liberties violations and a claim that the war was illegal.<ref>Walker, p 286.</ref>

Also in 1968, the ACLU held an internal symposium to discuss its dual roles: providing "direct" legal support (defense for accused in their initial trial, benefiting only the individual defendant), and appellate support (providing amicus briefs during the appeal process, to establish widespread legal precedent).<ref name=W285>Walker, p. 285.</ref> Historically, the ACLU was known for its appellate work which led to landmark Supreme Court decisions, but by 1968, 90% of the ACLUs legal activities involved direct representation. The symposium concluded that both roles were valid for the ACLU.<ref name=W285/>

==1970s and 1980s==
===Watergate era===
[[File:Richard Nixon.jpg|thumb|160px|right|The ACLU was the first organization to call for the impeachment of [[Richard Nixon]].]]
The ACLU supported ''[[The New York Times]]'' in the Times<U+2019> 1971 suit against the government, requesting permission to publish the [[Pentagon papers]]. The court upheld the Times and ACLU in the ''[[New York Times Co. v. United States]]'' ruling, which held that the government could not preemptively prohibit the publication of classified information: the government had to wait until after it was published to take action.<ref>Walker, pp. 289<U+2013>290.</ref>

As the [[Watergate]] saga unfolded, the ACLU became the first national organization to call for Nixon's impeachment.<ref name=W2924>Walker, pp. 292<U+2013>294. The ACLU published a full page newspaper advertisement on October 14, 1973, urging impeachment.</ref> This, following the resolution opposing the Vietnam war, was a second major decision that caused critics of the ACLU, particularly conservatives, to claim that the ACLU had evolved into a liberal political organization.<ref>Walker, p. 294</ref>

===Enclaves and new civil liberties===
The decade from 1965 to 1975 saw an expansion of the field of civil liberties. Administratively, the ACLU responded by appointing [[Aryeh Neier]] to take over from Pemberton as Executive Director in 1970. Neier embarked on an ambitious program to expand the ACLU: he created the ACLU Foundation to raise funds, and he created several new programs to focus the ACLU's legal efforts. By 1974, ACLU membership had reached 275,000.<ref>Walker, pp. 314<U+2013>316.</ref>

During those years, the ACLU led the way in expanding legal rights in three directions: new rights for persons within government-run "enclaves", new rights for victim groups, and privacy rights for mainstream citizens.<ref>Walker, p. 299. Key ACLU leaders in this effort were [[Ira Glasser]] and [[Aryeh Neier]]</ref> At the same time, the organization grew substantially. The ACLU helped develop the field of constitutional law that governs "enclaves", which are groups of persons that live in conditions under government control. Enclaves include mental hospital patients, members of the military, and prisoners, and students (while at school). The term enclave originated with Supreme Court justice [[Abe Fortas]]'s use of the phrase "schools may not be enclaves of totalitarianism" in the ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines]]'' decision.<ref>Raskin, James B. (2009), "No Enclaves of Totalitarianism", American University Law Review, Vol. 58:1193.</ref>

The ACLU initiated the legal field of student's rights with the ''Tinker v. Des Moines'' case, and expanded it with cases such as ''[[Goss v. Lopez]]'' which required schools to provide students an opportunity to appeal suspensions.<ref>Walker, p. 307.</ref>

As early as 1945, the ACLU had taken a stand to protect the rights of the mentally ill, when it drafted a model statute governing mental commitments.<ref name=W309>Walker, p. 309.</ref> In the 1960s, the ACLU opposed involuntary commitments, unless it could be demonstrated that the person was a danger to himself or the community.<ref name=W309/> In the landmark 1975 ''[[O'Connor v. Donaldson]]'' decision the ACLU represented a non-violent mental health patient who had been confined against his will for 15 years, and persuaded to Supreme Court to rule such involuntary confinements illegal.<ref name=W309/>

Prior to 1960, prisoners had virtually no recourse to the court system, because courts considered prisoners to have no civil rights.<ref>Note, "Beyond the Ken of Courts", ''Yale Law Journal'' 72 (1963):506. Cited by Walker, p. 310.</ref> That changed in the late 1950s, when the ACLU began representing prisoners that were subject to police brutality, or deprived of religious reading material.<ref name=W310>Walker, p. 310.</ref> In 1968, the ACLU successfully sued to desegregate the Alabama prison system; and in 1969, the New York affiliate adopted a project to represent prisoners in New York prisons. Private attorney [[Phil Hirschkop]] discovered degrading conditions in Virginia prisons following the [[Virginia State Penitentiary strike]], and won an important victory in 1971's ''[[Landman v. Royster]]'' which prohibited Virginia from treating prisoners in inhumane ways.<ref>Walker, pp. 310<U+2013>311. The ACLU was not involved in the ''Landman'' case.</ref> In 1972, the ACLU consolidated several prison rights efforts across the nation and created the [[National Prison Project]]. The ACLU's efforts led to landmark cases such as ''[[Ruiz v. Estelle]]'' (requiring reform of the Texas prison system) and in 1996 [[U.S. Congress]] enacted the [[Prison Litigation Reform Act]] (PLRA) which codified prisoners' rights.

===Victim groups===
[[File:Ruth Bader Ginsburg official SCOTUS portrait.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Ruth Bader Ginsberg]] founded the ACLU's Women's Rights Project in 1971.<ref>Pullman, Sandra (March 7, 2006). [http://www.aclu.org/womens-rights/tribute-legacy-ruth-bader-ginsburg-and-wrp-staff "Tribute: The Legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and WRP Staff"]. ''ACLU.org''. Accessed November 18, 2010.</ref> She was later appointed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] by President [[Bill Clinton]].]]
The ACLU, during the 1960s and 1970s, expanded its scope to include what it referred to as "victim groups", namely women, the poor, and [[homosexual]]s.<ref>Walker, p. 299.</ref>  Heeding the call of female members, the ACLU endorsed the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] in 1970<ref>The ERA was passed by congress in 1972, but failed to be ratified by the states.</ref> and created the [[Women's Rights Project]] in 1971. The Women's Rights Project dominated the legal field, handling more than twice as many cases as the [[National Organization for Women]], including breakthrough cases such as ''[[Reed v. Reed]]'', ''[[Frontiero v. Richardson]]'', and '' [[Taylor v. Louisiana]]''.<ref>Walker, pp. 304<U+2013>305.</ref>

ACLU leader [[Harriet Pilpel]] raised the issue of the rights of homosexuals in 1964, and two years later the ACLU formally endorsed [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]].   In 1973 the ACLU created the [[Sexual Privacy Project]] (later the [[Gay and Lesbian Rights Project]]) which combated discrimination against homosexuals.<ref>Walker, p. 312.</ref>

Rights of the poor was another area that was expanded by the ACLU. In 1966 and again in 1968, activists within the ACLU encouraged the organization to adopt a policy overhauling the welfare system, and guaranteeing low-income families a baseline income; but the ACLU board did not approve the proposals.<ref name=W313>Walker, p. 313.</ref> The ACLU played a key role in the 1968 ''[[King v. Smith]]'' decision, where the Supreme Court ruled that welfare benefits for children could not be denied by a state simply because the mother cohabited with a boyfriend.<ref name=W313/>
{{-}}

===Privacy===
The [[Privacy laws of the United States|right to privacy]] is not explicitly identified in the [[U.S. Constitution]], but the ACLU led the charge to establish such rights in the indecisive 1961 ''[[Poe v. Ullman]]'' case, which addressed a state statute outlawing contraception. The issue arose again in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' (1965), and this time the Supreme Court adopted the ACLUs position, and formally declared a right to privacy.<ref>Walker, pp. 300<U+2013>301</ref> The New York affiliate of the ACLU pushed to eliminate [[Opposition to the legalization of abortion|anti-abortion laws]] starting in 1964, a year before ''Griswold'' was decided, and in 1967 the ACLU itself formally adopted the [[Support for the legalization of abortion|right to abortion]] as a policy.<ref>Walker, p. 302.</ref> The ACLU led the defense in ''[[United States v. Vuitch]]'' which expanded the right of physicians to determine when [[abortion]]s were necessary.<ref>Walker, p. 303.</ref> These efforts culminated in one of the most controversial Supreme Court decisions of all time: ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', which legalized abortion in the first three months of pregnancy.<ref>Walker, p. 303. The ACLU did not participate directly in ''Roe v. Wade'', but did lead the effort in the companion case ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]''.</ref>  The ACLU successfully argued against state bans on [[interracial marriage]], in the case of ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' (1967).

Related to privacy, the ACLU engaged in several battles to ensure that government records about individuals were kept private, and to give individuals the right to review their records. The ACLU supported several measures, including the 1970 [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]] required credit agencies to divulge credit information to individuals; the 1973 [[Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act]], which provided students the right to access their records; and the 1974 Privacy Act which prevented the federal government from disclosing personal information without good cause.<ref>Walker, p. 308.</ref>

===Allegations of liberal bias===
In the early 1970s, conservatives began to criticize the ACLU for being too political and too liberal.<ref>Walker, p. 317.</ref> Legal scholar Joseph W. Bishop wrote that the ACLU's trend to partisanship started with its defense of Dr. Spock's anti-war protests.<ref>Bishop, Joseph W., "Politics and the ACLU", ''Commentary'' 52 (December 1971): 50<U+2013>58. Bishop cited by Walker.  Bishop was professor of law at Yale.</ref> Critics also blamed the ACLU for encouraging the Supreme Court to embrace [[judicial activism]].<ref name=W318>Walker, p. 318.</ref> Critics claimed that the ACLU's support of controversial decisions like ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' violated the [[Original intent|intention of the authors]] of the Bill of Rights.<ref name=W318/> The ACLU became an issue in the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential campaign]], when Republican candidate [[George H. W. Bush]] accused Democratic candidate [[Michael Dukakis]] (a member of the ACLU) of being a "card carrying member of the ACLU".<ref>Walker, pp. 319, 363. Bush quoted by Walker.</ref>

===The Skokie case===
It is the policy of the ACLU to support the civil liberties of defendants regardless of their ideological stance. The ACLU takes pride in defending individuals with unpopular or bigoted viewpoints, such as [[George Wallace]], [[George Lincoln Rockwell]], and [[KKK]] members.<ref>Walker, p 323 (Rockwell); Walker p 242 (Wallace).</ref> The ACLU has defended American Nazis many times, and their actions often brought protests, particularly from American Jews.<ref>Walker, p. 323.</ref>

In 1977, a small group of American Nazis, led by [[Frank Collin]], applied to the town of [[Skokie, Illinois]] for permission to hold a demonstration in the town park. Skokie at the time had a majority population of Jews, totaling 40,000 of 70,000 citizens. Skokie refused to grant permission, and an Illinois judge supported Skokie and enjoined the demonstration.<ref name=Skokie>Walker, pp. 323<U+2013>331.</ref> Skokie immediately passed three ordinances aimed at preventing the group from meeting in Skokie. The ACLU assisted Collins and appealed to federal court.<ref name=Skokie/> The appeal dragged on for a year, and the ACLU eventually prevailed in ''Smith v. Collin'', 447 F.Supp. 676.<ref>Ed McManus, "Nazi March: What's It All About?", ''Illinois Issues'', v.13, Nov. 1978 (available at [http://www.lib.niu.edu/ipo/1978/ii781111.html Illinois Periodicals Online]).<br/>The federal appeal case was  ''Smith v. Collin'' 447 F.Supp. 676.   See also Supreme Court: ''Smith v. Collin'', 439 U.S. 916 (1978), and 
 National Socialist Party v. Skokie, 432 U.S. 43 (1977).</ref>

The Skokie case was heavily publicized across America, partially because Jewish groups such as the [[Jewish Defense League]] and [[Anti Defamation League]] strenuously objected to the demonstration, leading many members of the ACLU to cancel their memberships.<ref name=Skokie/> The Illinois affiliate of the ACLU lost about 25% of its membership and nearly one-third of its budget.<ref>30,000 ACLU members resigned in protest.</ref><ref>Philippa Strum, ''When the Nazis Came to Skokie: Freedom for Speech We Hate'' (University Press of Kansas) ([http://www.kansaspress.ku.edu/strwhe.html University of Kansas Press publisher's catalog description]).</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://cdm.digitalpast.org/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/skokiepo001&CISOPTR=36 | title=Membership woes hurt ACLU while others gain}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://cdm.digitalpast.org/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/skokiepo001&CISOPTR=0 | title=2d suit to block Nazis from Skokie march fails}}</ref> The financial strain from the controversy lead to layoffs at local chapters.<ref>{{cite journal | last = | first = | title = The High Cost of Free Speech: A.C.L.U. dilemma: defending "hateful and heinous" ideas | publisher = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = June 28, 1978 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916244-1,00.html | accessdate =May 18, 2009}}</ref> After the membership crisis died down, the ACLU sent out a fund-raising appeal which explained their rationale for the Skokie case, and raised over $500,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|500000|1977}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) .<ref>Walker, p. 239.</ref>

===Reagan era===
The [[United States presidential election, 1980|election]] of [[Ronald Reagan]] as president in 1981 ushered in an [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|eight year period of conservative leadership]] in the U.S. government. Under his leadership, the government pushed a conservative social agenda, including outlawing abortion, inserting prayer in schools, banning pornography, and resisting gay rights.<ref>Walker, p. 341.</ref>

Fifty years after the [[Scopes trial]], the ACLU found itself fighting another classroom case: the [[Arkansas]] 1981 creationism statute, which required schools to teach the biblical account of creation as a scientific alternative to evolution. The ACLU won the case in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' decision.<ref>Walker, pp. 342<U+2013>343.<br />''[[McLean v. Arkansas|McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education]]'', 529 F. Supp. 1255 (E.D. Ark. 1982) ([http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html "transcription" by Clark Dorman], Jan. 30, 1996, at TalkOrigins).</ref>
[[File:Oliver North mug shot.jpg|thumb|160px|The ACLU defended [[Oliver North]] in 1990, arguing that his conviction was tainted by coerced testimony.]]
In 1982, the ACLU became involved in a case involving the distribution of [[child pornography]] (''[[New York v. Ferber]]''). In an amicus brief, the ACLU argued that child pornography that violates the [[three prong obscenity test]] should be outlawed, but that the law in question was overly restrictive because it outlawed artistic displays and otherwise non-obscene material. The court did not adopt the ACLU's position.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.aclu.org/privacy/speech/14793leg20020508.html | title = Letter to Reps.

During the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]]: then-[[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] noted that his opponent [[Michael Dukakis]] had described himself as a "card-carrying member of the ACLU" and used that as evidence that Dukakis was "a strong, passionate liberal" and "out of the mainstream."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/debatingourdestiny/dod/1988-broadcast.html | title=Debating Our Destiny: The 1988 Debates}}</ref> The phrase subsequently was used by the organization in an advertising campaign.<ref>{{cite news | author = Randall Rothenburg | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEED61E30F93BA1575AC0A96E948260 | title = A.C.L.U.

==Modern era==
===1990 to 2000===
In 1997, ruling unanimously in the case of ''[[Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union]]'', the Supreme Court voted down anti-[[indecency]] provisions of the [[Communications Decency Act]] (the CDA), finding they violated the freedom of speech provisions of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. In their decision, the Supreme Court held that the CDA's "use of the undefined terms 'indecent' and 'patently offensive' will provoke uncertainty among speakers about how the two standards relate to each other and just what they mean."<ref>[http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/boundvolumes/521bv.pdf 521 U. S. 844 (1997)]</ref>
[[File:Mount Soledad Cross WF.jpg|thumb|left|160px|A California affiliate of the ACLU sued to remove the [[Mount Soledad cross controversy|Mt. Soledad Cross]] from public lands in San Diego.]]
The ACLU's position on [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] is considered controversial by a broad cross-section of political points of view. In 2000, Marvin Johnson, a legislative counsel for the ACLU, stated that proposed anti-spam legislation infringed on free speech by denying anonymity and by forcing spam to be labeled as such: "Standardized labeling is compelled speech." He also stated, "It's relatively simple to click and delete."<ref>Adam S. Marlin, [http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/06/09/amend.spam.idg/ "First Amendment is obstacle to spam legislation"], CNN, June 9, 2000.</ref> The debate found the ACLU joining with the [[Direct Marketing Association (USA)|Direct Marketing Association]] and the [[Center for Democracy and Technology]] in criticizing a bipartisan bill in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 2000. As early as 1997 the ACLU had taken a strong position that nearly all spam legislation was improper, although it has supported "[[opt-out]]" requirements in some cases. The ACLU opposed the 2003 [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003|CAN-SPAM]] act<ref>ACLU, [http://www.aclu.org/freespeech/commercial/10953leg20030730.html "Letter to the Senate Urging Opposition to S.877, the "Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003""], July 30, 2003 (last visited Jan. 7, 2008).</ref> suggesting that it could have a [[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effect]] on speech in cyberspace.

In November 2000, 15 African-American residents of [[Hearne, Texas]] were indicted on drug charges after being arrested in a series of "drug sweeps". The ACLU filed a class action lawsuit, ''[[Kelly v. Paschall]]'', on their behalf, alleging that the arrests were unlawful. The ACLU contended that 15 percent of Hearne's male African American population aged 18 to 34 were arrested based on the "uncorroborated word of a single unreliable confidential informant coerced by police to make cases." On May 11, 2005, the ACLU and [[Robertson County, Texas|Robertson County]] announced a confidential settlement of the lawsuit, an outcome which "both sides stated that they were satisfied with." The District Attorney dismissed the charges against the plaintiffs of the suit.<ref>ACLU, [http://www.aclu.org/drugpolicy/racialjustice/10795prs20050602.html "In Wake of ACLU Civil Rights Lawsuit Settlement, African Americans Affected by Texas Drug Task Force Scandal Call for Reconciliation at Town Meeting "], June 2, 2005 (last visited April 10, 2009).</ref> The 2009 film [[American Violet]] depicts this case.<ref>[http://www.aclu.org/drugpolicy/racialjustice/39103res20090417.html ACLU: American Violet]</ref>

In the 2000, the ACLU's Massachusetts affiliate represented the [[North American Man Boy Love Association]] (NAMBLA), on first amendment grounds, in the ''[[Curley v. NAMBLA]]'' wrongful death civil suit that was based solely on the fact that a man who raped and murdered a child had visited the NAMBLA website.<ref name="ACLU-UnpopularSpeech">ACLU, [http://www.aclu.org/freespeech/protest/11289prs20000831.html "ACLU Statement on Defending Free Speech of Unpopular Organizations"], Aug. 31, 2000.</ref>  Also In 2000, the ACLU lost the ''[[Boy Scouts of America v. Dale]]'' case, which had asked the Supreme Court to require the [[Boy Scouts of America]] to drop their policy of prohibiting homosexuals from becoming Boy Scout leaders.<ref>ACLU, [http://www.aclu.org/scotus/1999/11988prs20000628.html "U.S. Supreme Court Ruling that boy Scouts Can Discriminate Is 'Damaging but Limited,' ACLU Says"], June 28, 2000 (last visited Oct. 26, 2009).</ref>

===Twenty first century===

In March 2004, the ACLU, along with [[Lambda Legal]] and the [[National Center for Lesbian Rights]], sued the state of California on behalf of 6 same-sex couples who were denied marriage licenses. That case, ''Woo v. Lockyer'', was eventually consolidated into ''[[In re Marriage Cases]]'', the [[California Supreme Court]] case which led to same-sex marriage being available in that state from June 16, 2008 until [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] was passed on November 4, 2008.<ref>[http://www.aclu.org/lgbt/relationships/californiamarriage.html "California Marriage Case"], ACLU, retrieved June 28, 2009</ref>
[[File:Rush Limbaugh.jpg|thumb|left|160px|The ACLU submitted arguments supporting [[Rush Limbaugh]]'s right to privacy during the criminal investigation of his alleged drug use.]]
During the 2004 trial regarding allegations of [[Rush Limbaugh]]'s drug abuse, the ACLU argued that his privacy should not have been compromised by allowing law enforcement examination of his medical records.<ref name=FOXRush>Donaldson-Evans, Catherine (January 12, 2004), [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,108140,00.html "ACLU Comes to Rush Limbaugh's Defense"], [[Fox News]]</ref>  In June 2004, the [[Dover Area School District|school district]] in [[Dover, Pennsylvania]] required that its high school biology students listen to a statement which asserted that the theory of [[evolution]] is not fact and mentioning [[intelligent design]] as an alternative theory. Several parents called the ACLU to complain, because they believed that the school was promoting a religious idea in the classroom and violating the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. The ACLU, joined by [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]], represented the parents in a lawsuit against the school district. After a lengthy trial, Judge [[John E. Jones III]] ruled in favor of the parents in the [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] decision, finding that intelligent design is not science and permanently forbidding the Dover school system from teaching intelligent design in science classes.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/21/education/21evolution.html?pagewanted=all "Judge Rejects Teaching Intelligent Design"], ''The New York Times'', December 21, 2005</ref>

In 2006, the ACLU of Washington State joined with a pro-gun rights organization, the [[Second Amendment Foundation]], and prevailed in a lawsuit against the North Central Regional Library District (NCRL) in Washington for its policy of refusing to disable restrictions upon an adult patron's request. Library patrons attempting to access pro-gun web sites were blocked, and the library refused to remove the blocks.<ref>''Bradburn et al v.

===Anti-terrorism issues===
After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the federal government instituted a broad range of new measures to combat [[terrorism]], including the passage of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]]. The ACLU challenged many of the measures, claiming that they violated rights regarding [[due process]], privacy, illegal searches, and [[cruel and unusual punishment]].  An ACLU policy statement states:<blockquote>Our way forward lies in decisively turning our backs on the policies and practices that violate our greatest strength: our Constitution and the commitment it embodies to the rule of law. Liberty and security do not compete in a zero-sum game; our freedoms are the very foundation of our strength and security.  The ACLU's National Security Project advocates for national security policies that are consistent with the Constitution, the rule of law, and fundamental human rights. The Project litigates cases relating to detention, torture, discrimination, surveillance, censorship, and secrecy.<ref>[http://www.aclu.org/national-security]</ref></blockquote>
During the ensuing debate regarding the proper balance of civil liberties and security, the membership of the ACLU increased by 20%, bringing the group's total enrollment to 330,000.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.post-gazette.com/localnews/20021202aclusidebarp8.asp | title = ACLU has new constituency after 9/11 | work = [[Associated Press]] via [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | date = December 2, 2002 | accessdate =November 20, 2007 | author = Ron Kampeas}}</ref> The growth continued, and by August 2008 ACLU membership was greater than 500,000. It remained at that level through 2011.<ref>ACLU, [http://aclu.org/about/index.html "About Us"]</ref>

The ACLU has been a vocal opponent of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] of 2001, the [[Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003|PATRIOT 2]] Act of 2003, and associated legislation made in response to the threat of domestic terrorism.   In response to a requirement of the USA PATRIOT Act, the ACLU withdrew from the [[Combined Federal Campaign]] charity drive.<ref name="cfc">ACLU, [http://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/18526prs20040731.html "Citing Government "Blacklist"; Policy, ACLU Rejects $500,000 from Funding Program "], July 31, 2004 (last visited Jan. 7, 2008).</ref> The campaign imposed a requirement that ACLU employees must be checked against a federal anti-terrorism watch list.

In 2004, the ACLU sued the federal government in  ''[[American Civil Liberties Union v. Ashcroft (2004)]]'' on behalf of [[Nicholas Merrill]], owner of an Internet Service Provider. Under the provisions of the PATRIOT act, the government had issued [[National Security Letter]]s to Merrill to compel him to provide private internet access information from some of his customers. In addition, the government placed a [[gag order]] on Merrill, forbidding him from discussing the matter with anyone.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hamblett |first=Mark |url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202426792619 |title=2nd Circuit Requires Judicial Review Before Security Letter Gag Order |publisher=New York Law Journal |date=December 16, 2008 |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Zetter |first=Kim|url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/08/nsl-gag-order-lifted/ |title='John Doe' Who Fought FBI Spying Freed From Gag Order After 6 Years |publisher=Wired.com |date=August 10, 2010 |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Doe |first=John |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/22/AR2007032201882.html |title=My National Security Letter Gag Order |publisher=Washington Post |date=March 23, 2007 |accessdate=November 15, 2010}}</ref>

In January 2006, the ACLU filed a lawsuit, ''[[ACLU v. NSA]]'', in a federal district court in Michigan, challenging government spying in the [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy]].<ref>Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief ("NSA Spying Complaint"), ''ACLU v. NSA'' (E.D. Mich. Jan. 17, 2006) ([http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nsaspying/23491lgl20060117.html#attach PDF of complaint available] at ACLU website, "Safe and Free: NSA Spying" section of website).</ref> On August 17, 2006, that court ruled that the warrantless wiretapping program is unconstitutional and ordered it ended immediately.<ref>Ryan Singel, [http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,71610-0.html?tw=wn_index_3 "Judge Halts NSA Snooping"], ''Wired'', August 17, 2006.</ref> However, the order was stayed pending an appeal.

The ACLU and other organizations also filed separate lawsuits around the country against telecommunications companies. The ACLU filed a lawsuit in Illinois (''Terkel v. AT&T'') which was dismissed because of the [[State Secrets Privilege]]<ref>[http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nsaspying/26235prs20060725.html "ACLU of Illinois Responds to Ruling in ''Terkel v. AT&T''], ACLU, July 25, 2006, retrieved January 7, 2008</ref> and two others in California requesting injunctions against [[AT&T]] and [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]].<ref>[http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nsaspying/25685prs20060526.html "ACLU Files Lawsuit in California Court Demanding End to Privacy Violations by AT&T and Verizon"], ACLU, May 26, 2006, retrieved January 7, 2008</ref> On August 10, 2006, the lawsuits against the telecommunications companies were transferred to a federal judge in San Francisco.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2006/08/11/BAGRGKGL4S1.DTL&type=politics | title= Surveillance lawsuits transferred to judge skeptical of Bush plan | work=San Francisco Chronicle | first=Bob | last=Egelko | date=August 11, 2006}}</ref>

The ACLU represents a [[Muslim-American]] who was detained but never accused of a crime in ''[[Al-Kidd v Ashcroft]]'', a civil suit against former Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]].<ref name=wp>{{cite news|title=Supreme Court to consider Ashcroft bid for immunity|first=Robert|last=Barnes|date=October 19, 2010|page=A2|work=Washington Post |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/18/AR2010101802032.html}}</ref>  In January 2010, the [[American military]] released the names of 645 detainees held at the [[Bagram Theater Internment Facility]] in [[Afghanistan]], modifying its long-held position against publicizing such information. This list was prompted by a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] lawsuit filed in September 2009 by the ACLU, whose lawyers had also requested detailed information about conditions, rules and regulations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/world/asia/17afghan.html|title=Bagram Detainees Named by U.S.|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 17, 2010|first1=Alissa J.|last1=Rubin|first2=Sangar|last2=Rahimi}}</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8462894.stm "US releases names of prisoners at Bagram, Afghanistan"]</ref>
