Since the early 1950s, both amygdalin and a modified form named '''laetrile''' or '''Vitamin B<sub>17</sub>''' have been promoted as [[alternative cancer treatments|cancer cures]]. However, neither of these compounds nor any other derivatives are [[vitamin]]s in any sense,<ref name=CaCancer/> and studies have found them to be clinically ineffective in the treatment of cancer, as well as dangerously toxic. They are potentially lethal when taken by mouth, because certain enzymes (in particular, glucosidases that occur in the gut and in various kinds of seeds, edible or inedible) act on them to produce [[cyanide]].<ref>Moss, M. ; Khalil, N. ; Gray, J.

==Chemistry==
Amygdalin is extracted from almonds or apricot kernels by boiling in [[ethanol]]; on evaporation of the solution and the addition of [[diethyl ether]], amygdalin is precipitated as white minute crystals. Liebig and W<U+00F6>hler were already able to find three decomposition products of the newly discovered amygdalin: sugar, [[benzaldehyde]], and prussic acid ([[hydrogen cyanide]]).<ref>{{cite journal

Several [[glucosidase]] [[enzyme]]s are known to act on amygdalin, leading to its decomposition by various pathways. [[Maltase]] causes partial degradation, giving <small>D</small>-glucose and [[mandelic nitrile glucoside]], C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CH(CN)O<U+00B7>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>11</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. [[Emulsin]], on the other hand, decomposes it into [[benzaldehyde]], [[cyanide]], and two molecules of [[glucose]]; this [[enzyme]] occurs in the [[bitter almond]], and consequently the seeds invariably contain free cyanide and benzaldehyde.  An "[[Amorphous solid|amorphous]] amygdalin" is said to occur in the cherry laurel (''[[Prunus laurocerasus]]''). Lastly, [[amygdalin beta-glucosidase]] and [[prunasin beta-glucosidase]] consecutively catalyze loss of the two glucose units to yield [[mandelonitrile]], which can then decompose to form free cyanide and benzaldehyde. One gram of amygdalin would release 68&nbsp;mg of hydrogen cyanide if fully decomposed along this route.

Natural amygdalin has the ''R'' configuration at the [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] [[benzyl]] center. Under mild basic conditions, this stereogenic center [[epimerizes]]; the ''S'' epimer is called '''neoamygdalin'''.<ref name=fenselau/>

==Laetrile==

Though it is sometimes sold as "Vitamin B<sub>17</sub>", it is not a [[vitamin]]. Amygdalin/laetrile was claimed to be a vitamin by chemist [[Ernst T.

==Toxicity==
The metabolism of amygdalin produces [[hydrogen cyanide]], a potent toxin. [[Amygdalin beta-glucosidase|Beta-glucosidase]], one of the enzymes that catalyzes the release of cyanide from amygdalin, is present in the human small intestine and in a variety of common foods. This leads to an unpredictable and potentially lethal toxicity when amygdalin or laetrile is taken orally.<ref name=CaCancer/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Newmark J, Brady RO, Grimley PM, Gal AE, Waller SG, Thistlethwaite JR |title=Amygdalin (Laetrile) and prunasin beta-glucosidases: distribution in germ-free rat and in human tumor tissue |journal=Proc.

Some laetrile promoters have claimed that the cyanide generated by laetrile is immediately harmlessly detoxified by the [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] enzyme [[rhodanese]] into [[thiocyanate]]. However, these claims are false. First, because thiocyanate is also toxic, although to a lesser degree. Second, the body only can use the small amount of rhodanese that is present in the blood, regardless of the stores present in kidneys and liver. Third, the limited factor in this conversion are the stores of [[cystine]], [[cysteine]], and other sulfur compounds, which are rapidly depleted in laetrile poisoning. Fourth, blood analysis shows undetoxified cyanide in persons poisoned with laetrile or with apricot kernels.<ref name="ajcn"/>

==Cancer treatment==
Amygdalin was first isolated in 1830. In 1845 it was used as a cancer treatment in Russia, and in the 1920s in the United States, but it was considered too poisonous.<ref name=CancerInstitute/> In the 1950s, a purportedly non-toxic, synthetic form was patented for use as a meat preservative,<ref name=patent>{{Cite patent| inventor-last = Krebs | inventor-first =Ernst T. | inventor2-last =Krebs, Jr. | inventor2-first =Ernst T. | date = May 23, 1961 | title = Hexuronic acid derivatives | url = http://www.freepatentsonline.com/2985664.html | country-code = US | patent-number = 2985664 |author=E Krebs}}</ref> and later marketed as laetrile for cancer treatment.<ref name=CancerInstitute/>

=== Initial studies at Sloan-Kettering ===
In 1972, [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] (MSKCC) board member [[Benno C. Schmidt, Sr.]] convinced the hospital to test laetrile so that he could assure others of its ineffectiveness "with some conviction."<ref name=Wade1977/> [[Kanematsu Sugiura]], the scientist who performed the requested tests, found that laetrile inhibited secondary tumors in mice, though it did not destroy the primary tumors. He repeated the experiment several times with the same results. However, three other researchers were unable to [[reproducibility|confirm]] Sugiura's results. While these uncontrolled and inconclusive results were considered too preliminary to publish, they were leaked to laetrile advocates, resulting in significant public attention.<ref name="Wade1977"/>

To expand on Sugiura's results, MSKCC researchers conducted a [[Scientific control|controlled]] experiment in which they injected some mice with laetrile (as Sugiura had done) and others with [[placebo]]. Sugiura, who was [[Double-blind#Double-blind trials|unaware of which mice had received laetrile]], performed the pathologic analysis. In this controlled, blinded follow-up of Sugiura's initial uncontrolled experiment, laetrile showed no more activity than placebo.<ref name="Wade1977"/>

Subsequently, laetrile was tested on 14 tumor systems without evidence of effectiveness. Given this collection of results, MSKCC concluded that "laetrile showed no beneficial effects."<ref name=Wade1977/> Mistakes in the MSKCC press release were highlighted by a group of laetrile proponents led by [[Ralph W. Moss (science writer)|Ralph Moss]], former public affairs official of MSKCC who was fired following his appearance at a press conference accusing the hospital of covering up the benefits of laetrile.<ref name="Budiansky1995">{{cite news | first=Stephen | last=Budiansky |authorlink= | title=Cures or Quackery: How Senator Harkin shaped federal research on alternative medicine | date=1995-07-09 | publisher= | url =http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/950717/archive_032434.htm | work =U.S. News & World Report | pages = | accessdate = 2009-11-07 | language = }}</ref> These mistakes were considered scientifically inconsequential, but Nicholas Wade in ''Science'' stated that "even the appearance of a departure from strict objectivity is unfortunate."<ref name=Wade1977>{{cite journal |author=Wade N |title=Laetrile at Sloan-Kettering: A Question of Ambiguity |journal=Science |volume=198 |issue=4323 |pages=1231<U+2013>4 |date=December 1977 |pmid=17741690 |doi=10.1126/science.198.4323.1231 }}</ref> The results from these studies were published all together.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stock CC, Tarnowski GS, Schmid FA, Hutchison DJ, Teller MN |title=Antitumor tests of amygdalin in transplantable animal tumor systems |journal=J Surg Oncol |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=81<U+2013>8 |year=1978 |pmid=642516 |doi=10.1002/jso.2930100202}}<br/>

=== Subsequent clinical studies ===

A 2011 [[systematic review]] from the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] found: {{quotation|The claims that laetrile or amygdalin have beneficial effects for cancer patients are not currently supported by sound clinical data.

The authors also recommended, on ethical grounds, that no further clinical research into laetrile or amygdalin be conducted.<ref name=sr2011/>

Given the lack of evidence, laetrile has not been approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]].<ref name=ncifaq/>

The U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] evaluated the evidence separately and concluded that clinical trials of amygdalin showed little or no effect against cancer.<ref name =CancerInstitute>[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/laetrile/patient/allpages#Section_20 Laetrile/Amygdalin <U+2013> National Cancer Institute]</ref> For example, a 1982 trial of 175 patients found that tumor size had increased in all but one patient.<ref>http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative/therapies/laetrile</ref> The authors reported that "the hazards of amygdalin therapy were evidenced in several patients by symptoms of cyanide toxicity or by blood cyanide levels approaching the lethal range."<ref name=Moertel82/> The investigators found that intravenous and oral amygdalin showed minimal toxicity under the conditions evaluated; however, two patients who ate raw almonds while undergoing oral treatment developed symptoms of cyanide poisoning.<ref>http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/laetrile/patient/Page2#Section_24</ref>

The study concluded "Patients exposed to this agent should be instructed about the danger of cyanide poisoning, and their blood cyanide levels should be carefully monitored. Amygdalin (Laetrile) is a toxic drug that is not effective as a cancer treatment".

The Mayo Clinic also conducted a study <ref>http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/laetrile/patient/Page2#Section_24</ref>

Additionally,  "No controlled clinical trials (trials that compare groups of patients who receive the new treatment to groups who do not) of laetrile have been reported." <ref>http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/laetrile/patient/Page2#Section_24</ref>

The side effects of laetrile treatment are the symptoms of cyanide poisoning. These symptoms include: Nausea and vomiting, Headache, Dizziness, Blue color of the skin due to a lack of oxygen in the blood, Liver damage, Abnormally low blood pressure, Droopy upper eyelid, Trouble walking due to damaged nerves, Fever, Mental confusion, Coma, Death.

=== Advocacy and legality ===

Laetrile was proven clinically ineffective more than 30 years ago and is considered a canonical example of "[[quackery]]".<ref name=CaCancer/> Nonetheless, advocates for laetrile dispute this label, asserting that there is a conspiracy between the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the [[pharmaceutical industry]] and the medical community, including the [[American Medical Association]] and the [[American Cancer Society]], to exploit the American people, and especially cancer patients. Advocates of the use of laetrile have also changed the rationale for its use, first as a treatment of cancer, then as a vitamin, then as part of a "holistic" nutritional regimen, or as treatment for cancer pain, among others, none of which have any significant evidence supporting its use.  Despite the lack of evidence for its use, laetrile developed a significant following due to its wide promotion as a "pain-free" treatment of cancer as an alternative to [[surgery]] and [[chemotherapy]] that have significant side effects. The use of laetrile in place of known effective treatments of cancer led to a number of deaths.<ref name=ConsumerReports>{{Cite book  | last = Editors of Consumer Reports Books | title = Health Quackery | place = Vernon, New York | publisher = Consumers Union | year = 1980 | chapter = Laetrile: the Political Success of a Scientific Failure | pages = 16<U+2013>40 | isbn = 0-89043-014-4  | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.
