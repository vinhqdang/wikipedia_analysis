The '''Johns Hopkins Hospital''' is the [[teaching hospital]] and [[biomedical research]] facility of [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]], located in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] ([[United States|USA]]). It was founded using money from a bequest by [[philanthropist]] [[Johns Hopkins]]. The Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Johns Hopkins 
School of Medicine  are the founding institutions of modern American medicine and are the birthplace of numerous traditions 
including "rounds", "residents" and "housestaff".<ref>http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/Psychiatry/education/residency_general/index.html</ref> 

The Johns Hopkins Hospital is the birthplace of many medical specialties including [[neurosurgery]], [[urology]], [[gynecologic pathology]], [[endocrinology]], [[pediatrics]],<ref>http://www.hopkinschildrens.org/milestones-timeline.aspx</ref><ref>http://www.hopkinschildrens.org/tpl_rlinks.aspx?id=98</ref> [[cardiac surgery]]<ref>http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/stlm</ref> and [[child psychiatry]].<ref>[http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/about/history/index.html "JHM History"] ''[[Johns Hopkins Medicine]]'', Accessed August 7, 2008.</ref><ref>http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/Psychiatry/about_us/_Psychiatry_Cent.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/Psychiatry/child_adolescent/</ref> It is widely regarded as one of the world's greatest hospitals.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Here-My-Hope-Inspirational-Hospital/dp/product-description/0385500327 Amazon.com: Here is My Hope: A Book of Healing and Prayer: Inspirational Stories of Johns Hopkins Hospital: Randi Henderson,Richard Marek: Books<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It has been ranked by ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' as the best overall hospital in America for 20 consecutive years.<ref name="health.usnews.com">[http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/best-hospitals/2008/07/10/best-hospitals-honor-roll.html "America's Best Hospitals 2008: Johns Hopkins Hospital"] ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'', Accessed August 6, 2008.</ref><ref>http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/usnews/</ref><ref>http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/Press_releases/2009/07_16_09.html</ref>

==History==
[[Johns Hopkins]], a Baltimore merchant and banker,  left an estate of $7 million ($123.8 million in 2009 [[USD]]) when he died on Christmas Eve 1873 at the age of seventy-eight. In his will, he asked that his fortune be used to found two institutions that would bear his name: "[[Johns Hopkins University]]" and "The Johns Hopkins Hospital." At the time that it was made, Hopkins' gift was the largest [[Philanthropy|philanthropic]] bequest in the history of the United States.<ref>Harvey, A.M., Brieger, G.H., Abrams, S. L., McKusick, V.A.,'' A Model of Its Kind, A Centennial History of Medicine at Johns Hopkins'', Johns Hopkins University Press (Baltimore) 1989.</ref>

Toward the end of his life, Hopkins selected twelve prominent Baltimoreans to be the trustees for the project and a year before his death, sent a letter telling them that he was giving "thirteen acres of land, situated in the city of Baltimore, and bounded by Wolfe, Monument, Broadway and Jefferson streets upon which I desire you to erect a hospital." He wished for a hospital "which shall, in construction and arrangement, compare favorably with any other institution of like character in this country or in Europe" and directed his trustees to "secure for the service of the Hospital, physicians and surgeons of the highest character and greatest skill." <ref>Harvey, A.M., Brieger, G.H., Abrams, S. L., McKusick, V.A.,'' A Model of Its Kind, A Centennial History of Medicine at Johns Hopkins'', Johns Hopkins University Press (Baltimore) 1989.</ref>

Most importantly, Hopkins told the trustees to "bear constantly in mind that it is my wish and purpose that the [hospital] shall ultimately form a part of the Medical School of that university for which I have made ample provision in my will."  By calling for this integral relationship between patient care, as embodied in the hospital, and teaching and research, as embodied in the university, Hopkins laid the groundwork for a revolution in American medicine. Johns Hopkins' vision, of two institutions in which the practice of medicine would be wedded to medical research and medical education was nothing short of revolutionary.

Initial plans for the hospital were drafted by surgeon [[John Shaw Billings]], and the architecture designed by [[John Rudolph Niernsee]] and completed by [[Edward Clarke Cabot]] of the Boston firm of Cabot and Chandler in a [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne style]].<ref>Dorsey, John & Dilts, James D., ''Guide to Baltimore Architecture'' (1997) p. 203-4.  Tidewater Publishers, Centreville, Maryland ISBN 0-87033-477-8</ref> When completed in 1889 at a cost of $2,050,000 ($48.3 million in 2009 [[USD]]), the hospital included what was then state-of-the art concepts in heating and ventilation to check the spread of disease.

Many medical specialties were born at Johns Hopkins Hospital, including [[neurosurgery]], [[urology]], [[endocrinology]], [[cardiac surgery]]<ref>http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/stlm</ref>, [[pediatrics]], [[critical care medicine]], and [[child psychiatry]].<ref>[http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/about/history/index.html "JHM History"] ''[[Johns Hopkins Medicine]]'', Accessed August 7, 2008.</ref><ref>http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/Psychiatry/about_us/_Psychiatry_Cent.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/Psychiatry/child_adolescent/</ref>  

The trustees obtained the services of four outstanding physicians, known as the "Big Four," to serve as the founding staff of the hospital when it opened in May 1889. They were pathologist [[William Henry Welch]], surgeon [[William Stewart Halsted]], internist [[William Osler]], and gynecologist [[Howard Atwood Kelly]].<ref name = "big four">[http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/about/history/history5.html Johns Hopkins Medicine:The Four Founding Professors]</ref>

Osler, the first chief of the Department of Medicine, is credited with originating the idea of a residency, whereby recently graduated doctors receive advanced training in their specialty while treating patients under supervision; then as now, residents comprise most of the medical staff of the hospital. He also introduced the idea of bringing medical students into actual patient care early in their training; at the time medical school consisted almost entirely of lectures. He once said he hoped his tombstone would say only, "He brought medical students into the wards for bedside teaching."<ref name = "big four" />

Halsted, the first chief of the Department of Surgery, established many other medical and surgical achievements at Johns Hopkins including modern surgical principles of control of bleeding, accurate anatomical dissection, complete sterility, and the first radical mastectomy for breast cancer (before this time, such a diagnosis was a virtual death sentence). His other achievements included the introduction of the surgical glove and advances in thyroid, biliary tree, hernia, intestinal and arterial aneurysm surgeries. Halsted also established the first formal surgical residency training program in the United States.

Kelly is credited with establishing gynecology as a true specialty. He created new surgical approaches to women's diseases and invented numerous medical devices, including a urinary cystoscope. He was one of the first to use radium to treat cancer.<ref name = "big four" />

Welch was responsible for training many of the outstanding physicians of the day, such as [[Walter Reed]]. He also founded at Hopkins the nation's first School of Public Health.<ref name = "big four" />

Additional medical achievements at Johns Hopkins include the first [[male-to-female sex reassignment surgery]] in the United States that took place in 1966 at the Hopkins Gender Identity Clinic.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wexler |first1=Laura |year=2007 |title=Identity Crisis |journal=Baltimore Style |volume= |issue=January/February |pages= |url=http://www.baltimorestyle.com/index.php/style/features_article/fe_sexchange_jf07 |doi= |accessdate=2009-10-12}}</ref> Two of the most far-reaching advances in medicine during the last 25 years were also made at Hopkins. First, the Nobel Prize-winning discovery of [[restriction enzymes]] gave birth to the genetic engineering industry. Second, the discovery of the brain's natural [[opiates]] has triggered an explosion of interest in [[neurotransmitter]] pathways and functions. Other accomplishments include the development of [[HeLa]], the first and arguably most important line of human cells grown in culture; identification of the three types of [[polio virus]]; and the first "[[blue baby]]" operation, which opened the way to modern [[heart surgery]].<ref>[http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/about/history/index.html "JHM History"] ''[[Johns Hopkins Medicine]]'', Accessed August 7, 2008.</ref>

On September 16, 2010, a man shot himself and his mother and a doctor after allegedly being upset about his mother's treatment. At 11:15 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time), hospital authorities locked down some parts of the hospital and evacuated others. By 1:30 p.m., police found the shooter and his mother both dead.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fenton|first=Justin|title=Two dead after standoff at Hopkins|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-shooting-hopkins-20100916,0,1885569.story|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=September 16, 2010|author2=Hermann, Peter}}</ref>
