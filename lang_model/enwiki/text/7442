"'''International Player's Anthem (I Choose You)'''" is a single by [[UGK]] on their album ''[[UGK (Underground Kingz)]]'', featuring [[OutKast]].

==Background==
The beat was produced by [[DJ Paul]] and [[Juicy J]] of [[Three 6 Mafia]], and utilizes a sample of "I Choose You" by [[Willie Hutch]]. It was originally used on a song by [[Project Pat]], "Choose U"; from his album, ''[[Layin' da Smack Down]]''. The sample was also used in "Rap's a Hustle" by Cormega on his album ''The Realness'' as well as "P.I.M.P. Pt.2" by [[50 Cent]] on his album ''Bulletproof''. An almost exact sample "i chose you" by Willie Hutch was produced by Wu Tang Clan affiliate DJ Mathematics.

The video was awarded Video of the Year at the 2008 annual BET Hip-Hop awards.

The song has been nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]].

==Music video==
The music video is centered around the fictional wedding of Andre 3000, progressing through the men's waiting room before the ceremony, the wedding itself, the reception, and the afterparty dance.
The video Premiered  on [[MTV Jams]] on June 4, 2007



Before the wedding ceremony, Bun B and friends ridicule Andre for supposedly rushing into getting married, and poke fun at him for wearing a red kilt ("I've got Scottish in my family," Andre calmly states). DJ Paul humorously says that it makes him look like [[Roddy Piper]] of [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE). Andre defends his decision to get married, saying that he is ready to take the next step in life, and in turn berates his friends for not looking to get into commitments themselves.

During the wedding, Andre talks about text messaging past flings and telling them that he has found love and will be giving up his life as a player. Interestingly, the audience remains seated as the bride (played by actress [[Salina Soto]] (CSI:NY, Forbidden) marches to the altar, a boy plays with an oversize toy spaceship, and one of Andre's past flings makes a side remark to him (the verse that is being rapped), to the dismay of her date.  A choir and its director, [[T-Pain]], sing the "I Choose You" vocals as the wedding progresses, while the groomsmen and other friends implore Andre to "keep your heart, 3 stacks!"

Later at the afterparty, two of Andre's past flings get into an argument while attempting to catch the bride's bouquet, which escalates into a full-blown fist fight that destroys the wedding cake and much of the buffet.  The male onlookers are pleasantly shocked, the bride is almost reduced to tears, but the rest of the main characters (including the bride) all smile at the end, apparently having a good time.

At the BET Hip Hop Awards in October, "International Player's Anthem" was nominated for top Hip Hop Video and won Best Collaboration.

The video features cameos by [[Bishop Don "Magic" Juan]], [[DJ Paul]] and [[Juicy J]] of [[Three 6 Mafia]], [[Chamillionaire]], [[T-Pain]], [[Fonzworth Bentley]], [[David Banner]], [[Kardinal Offishall]], [[Katt Williams]], [[Big Gipp]], [[Alex Thomas]], Deray Davis, along with actor [[Lukas Haas]].

At the 2007 BET Hip Hop Awards, Kanye West won the Best Hip Hop Video award but felt this video deserved it more. He called Big Boi during his acceptance speech, who felt Kanye deserved it.  During both the 2007 BET Hip Hop Awards and 2008 BET Awards, only Bun B and Big Boi were there to accept the award.
