'''Washington, D.C.''', formally the '''District of Columbia''' and commonly referred to as '''Washington''', "'''the District'''", or simply '''D.C.''', is the [[capital city|capital]] of the [[United States]].  On July 16, 1790, the [[Residence Act]] approved the creation of a [[capital district]] located along the [[Potomac River]] on the country's [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. As permitted by the [[U.S. Constitution]], the District is under the [[District of Columbia home rule|exclusive jurisdiction]] of the [[United States Congress]] and is therefore not a part of any [[U.S. state]].

The states of [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]] each donated land to form the federal district, which included the preexisting settlements of [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] and [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]]; however, [[District of Columbia retrocession|Congress returned the Virginia portion]] in 1846. Named in honor of [[George Washington]], the City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital. Congress created a [[District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871|single municipal government]] for the whole District of Columbia after the [[American Civil War]].

Washington, D.C., had an estimated population of 632,323 in 2012, the [[List of United States cities by population|24th most populous place]] in the United States. Commuters from the surrounding Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city's population to more than one&nbsp;million during the workweek. The [[Washington Metropolitan Area]], of which the District is a part, has a population of 5.7&nbsp;million, the [[Table of United States Metropolitan Statistical Areas|seventh-largest]] [[United States metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] in the country.

The centers of all three branches of the [[federal government of the United States]] are in the District, including the Congress, [[President of the United States|President]], and [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. Washington is home to many national [[List of museums in Washington, D.C.|monuments and museums]], which are primarily situated on or around the [[National Mall]]. The city hosts 176 [[List of diplomatic missions in the United States|foreign embassies]] as well as the headquarters of many international organizations, trade unions, non-profit organizations, lobbying groups, and professional associations.

A locally elected [[Mayor of the District of Columbia|mayor]] and 13-member [[Council of the District of Columbia|council]] have governed the District since 1973; however, the Congress maintains supreme authority over the city and may overturn local laws. The District has a [[District of Columbia voting rights|non-voting]], at-large [[Delegate (United States Congress)|Congressional delegate]], but no senators.  The [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ratified in 1961, grants the District [[Electoral College (United States)|three electoral votes]] in presidential elections.

=== Foundation ===
[[File:US Capitol 1814c.jpg|thumb|left|The U.S. Capitol after the [[burning of Washington]] during the [[War of 1812]]]]

On July 9, 1790, Congress passed the [[Residence Act]], which approved the creation of a national capital on the [[Potomac River]]. The exact location was to be selected by President [[George Washington]], who signed the bill into law on July 16. Formed from land donated by the states of Maryland and Virginia, the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring {{convert|10|mi|km|}} on each side, totaling {{convert|100|sqmi|km2|}}.<ref name=Crew89>{{cite book |last=Crew |first=Harvey W. |coauthors=William Bensing Webb, John Wooldridge |title=Centennial History of the City of Washington, D.

Two preexisting settlements were included in the territory: the port of [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown, Maryland]], founded in 1751,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/Wash/dc15.htm |title=Georgetown Historic District |accessdate=2008-07-05 |publisher=[[National Park Service]]}}</ref> and the city of [[Alexandria, Virginia]], founded in 1749.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alexandriahistorical.org/history.html |title=Alexandria's History |accessdate=2009-04-04 |publisher=Alexandria Historical Society }}</ref> During 1791<U+2013>92, [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Andrew Ellicott]] and several assistants, including a [[Free negro|free African American]] astronomer named [[Benjamin Banneker]], surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed [[Boundary Stones (District of Columbia)|boundary stones]] at every mile point.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bordewich|first=Fergus M.|title=Washington: the making of the American capital|year=2008|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-084238-3|pages=76<U+2013>80|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kKKMJ7Rqta8C}}</ref> Many of the stones are still standing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/ |title=Boundary Stones of Washington, D.C. |publisher=BoundaryStones.org |accessdate=2008-05-27 }}</ref>

A new "federal city" was then constructed on the north bank of the Potomac, to the east of Georgetown. On September 9, 1791, the three commissioners overseeing the capital's construction named the city in honor of President Washington. The federal district was named [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]], which was a poetic name for the United States commonly in use at that time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crew |first=Harvey W. |coauthors=William Bensing Webb, John Wooldridge|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5Q81AAAAIAAJ|title=Centennial History of the City of Washington, D.C.|chapter=IV.

Congress passed the [[District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801|Organic Act of 1801]], which officially organized the District and placed the entire territory under the [[District of Columbia home rule|exclusive control]] of the federal government.

=== Retrocession and the Civil War ===
{{see also|District of Columbia retrocession|Washington, D.C., in the American Civil War}}
In the 1830s, the District's southern territory of Alexandria went into economic decline partly due to neglect by Congress.<ref name=richards>{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Mark David|date=Spring/Summer 2004|title=The Debates over the Retrocession of the District of Columbia, 1801<U+2013>2004|journal=Washington History|publisher=Historical Society of Washington, D.C.|pages=54<U+2013>82|url=http://www.dcvote.org/pdfs/mdrretro062004.pdf|accessdate=2009-01-16}}</ref> Alexandria was a major market in the American slave trade and residents feared that [[Abolitionism|abolitionists]] in Congress would end slavery in the District, further depressing the economy. Alexandrians petitioned Virginia to take back the land it had donated to form the District; a process known as [[District of Columbia retrocession|retrocession]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Greeley |first=Horace |title=The American Conflict: A History of the Great Rebellion in the United States |publisher=G. & C.W. Sherwood |year=1864 |location=Chicago |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ZlIMAAAAYAAJ |pages=142<U+2013>144}}</ref>

The state legislature voted in February 1846 to accept the return of Alexandria and on July 9, 1846, Congress agreed to return all the territory that had been ceded by Virginia. Therefore, the District's current area consists only of land donated by Maryland.<ref name=richards /> Confirming the fears of pro-slavery Alexandrians, the [[Compromise of 1850]] outlawed the slave trade in the District, although not slavery itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/Compromise1850.html |title=Compromise of 1850 |accessdate=2008-07-24 |date=September 21, 2007 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] }}</ref>

The outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861 led to notable growth in the District's population due to the expansion of the federal government and a large influx of freed slaves.<ref name="Dodd">{{cite book |last=Dodd |first=Walter Fairleigh |title=The government of the District of Columbia |publisher=John Byrne & Co. |year=1909 |location=Washington, D.C. |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_29DAAAAIAAJ |pages=40<U+2013>5 }}</ref> President [[Abraham Lincoln]] signed the [[Compensated Emancipation Act]] in 1862, which ended slavery in the District of Columbia and freed about 3,100 enslaved persons, nine months prior to the [[Emancipation Proclamation]].<ref name=emancipation>{{cite web|url=http://emancipation.dc.gov/page/ending-slavery-district-columbia |title=Ending Slavery in the District of Columbia |accessdate=2012-05-12 |publisher=D.C.

[[File:L'Enfant plan.jpg|right|thumb|The [[L'Enfant Plan]] for Washington, D.C., as revised by [[Andrew Ellicott]] in 1792]]

Washington, D.C., is a [[New town|planned city]]. In 1791, President Washington commissioned [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant|Pierre (Peter) Charles L<U+2019>Enfant]], a French-born architect and city planner, to design the new capital. The [[L'Enfant Plan]] featured broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles, providing room for open space and landscaping.<ref name=lenfant>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/wash/lenfant.htm |title=The L'Enfant and McMillan Plans |accessdate=2008-05-27 |publisher=[[National Park Service]] }}</ref> He based his design on plans of cities such as [[Paris]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Karlsruhe]], and [[Milan]] brought from Europe by Thomas Jefferson in 1788.<ref>{{cite book|title=Public space and the ideology of place in American culture|year=2009|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-2574-5|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7pVtaBw6cq0C|editor=Miles Orvell|page=22}}</ref> L'Enfant's design also envisioned a garden-lined "grand avenue" approximately {{convert|1|mi|km}} in length and {{convert|400|ft|m}} wide in the area that is now the National Mall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/62wash/62locate1.htm|title=Map 1: The L'Enfant Plan for Washington|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2009-10-27}}</ref>

President Washington dismissed L'Enfant in March 1792 due to conflicts with the three commissioners appointed to supervise the capital's construction. [[Andrew Ellicott]], who had worked with L'Enfant surveying the city, was then tasked with completing the design. Though Ellicott made revisions to the original plans, including changes to some street patterns, L'Enfant is still credited with the overall design of the city.<ref>{{cite book |last=Crew |first=Harvey W. |coauthors=William Bensing Webb, John Wooldridge |title=Centennial History of the City of Washington, D. C. |publisher=United Brethren Publishing House |year=1892 |location=Dayton, Ohio |url=http://books.google.com/?id=5Q81AAAAIAAJ |pages=101<U+2013>3}}</ref>

By the early 1900s, L'Enfant's vision of a grand national capital had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings, including a railroad station on the National Mall. Congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying Washington's ceremonial core.<ref name=ramroth /> What became known as the [[McMillan Plan]] was finalized in 1901 and included re-landscaping the Capitol grounds and the National Mall, clearing slums, and establishing a new city-wide park system. The plan is thought to have largely preserved L'Enfant's intended design.<ref name=lenfant />

By law, Washington's skyline is low and sprawling. The [[The Height of Buildings Act of 1899|first building height restrictions]] in D.C. were put in place following the construction of the twelve-story [[Cairo Apartment Building]] in 1894. The [[Heights of Buildings Act of 1910]] amended the restrictions to allow buildings that are no taller than the width of the adjacent street, plus {{convert|20|ft|m}}.<ref name="Schwartzman">{{cite news|last=Schwartzman|first=Paul|title=High-Level Debate On Future of D.C.|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/01/AR2007050101939.html|accessdate=2012-07-01|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=May 2, 2007}}</ref> Despite popular belief, no law has ever limited buildings to the height of the United States Capitol or the {{convert|555|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Washington Monument]],<ref name=legend/> which remains the District's tallest structure.

[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One, Section Eight of the United States Constitution]] grants the U.S. Congress "exclusive jurisdiction" over the city. The District did not have an elected local government until the passage of the [[District of Columbia Home Rule Act|1973 Home Rule Act]]. The Act devolved certain Congressional powers to an [[Mayor of the District of Columbia|elected mayor]], currently [[Vincent C. Gray]], and the thirteen-member [[Council of the District of Columbia]].

The mayor and council set local taxes and a budget, which must be approved by the Congress. The [[Government Accountability Office]] and other analysts have estimated that the city's high percentage of tax-exempt property and the inability to set a commuter tax create a structural deficit in the District's local budget of anywhere between $470&nbsp;million and over $1&nbsp;billion per year. Congress typically provides additional grants for federal programs such as [[Medicaid]] and the operation of the [[National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997|local justice system]]; however, analysts claim that the payments do not fully resolve the imbalance.<ref name=DCAppleseed>{{cite web|title=Buildling the Best Capital City in the World|url=http://www.dcappleseed.org/library/DC%20Appleseed%20Report.FINAL.pdf|publisher=DC Appleseed|accessdate=2011-02-05}}</ref><ref name=GAO>{{cite web|title=District of Columbia Structural Imbalance and Management Issues|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03666.pdf|publisher=Government Accountability Office|month=May|year=2003|accessdate=2011-02-05}}</ref>

According to a 2010 study, Washington-area commuters spent 70&nbsp;hours a year in traffic delays, which tied with Chicago for having the nation's worst road congestion.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ashley |last=Halsey III |title=Washington area tied with Chicago for traffic congestion, study finds |date=January 20, 2011 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/20/AR2011012000056.html |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=2011-08-15 }}</ref> However, 37% of Washington-area commuters take public transportation to work, the second-highest rate in the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/06/13/real_estate/public_transit_commutes/index.htm |title=New Yorkers are top transit users |accessdate=2008-07-15 |last=Christie |first=Les |date=June 29, 2007 |publisher=CNNMoney }}</ref> An additional 12% of D.C. commuters walked to work, 6% carpooled, and 3% traveled by bicycle in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=District of Columbia Commuting Characteristics by Sex|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/10_1YR/S0801/0400000US11|work=2010 American Community Survey|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=2011-10-16}}</ref> A 2011 study by [[Walk Score]] found that Washington was the seventh-most walkable city in the country with 80% of residents living in neighborhoods that are not car dependent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wtop.com/?nid=41&sid=2487841|title=D.C. among top 10 most walkable cities |publisher=WTOP |date=August 8, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-28}}</ref>

There are {{convert|1500|mi|km}} of [[Streets and highways of Washington, D.C.|streets, parkways, and avenues]] in the District.<ref>{{cite web|title=Public Road Length|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policy/ohim/hs06/htm/hm10.htm|work=Highway Statistics 2006|publisher=Federal Highway Administration|accessdate=2012-09-17}}</ref> Due to the [[Freeway and expressway revolts|freeway revolts]] of the 1960s, much of the proposed [[interstate highway system]] through the middle of Washington was never built. [[Interstate 95]], the nation's major east coast highway, therefore bends around the District to form the eastern portion of the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Capital Beltway]]. A portion of the proposed highway funding was directed to the region's public transportation infrastructure instead.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schrag|first=Zachary|title=The Great Society Subway|year=2006|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vDQI-02wki0C|chapter=Chapter 5: The Bridge|isbn=9780801889066}}</ref> The interstate highways that do continue into Washington, including [[Interstate 66]] and [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia&nbsp;<U+2013> Virginia)|Interstate 395]], both terminate shortly after entering the city.

The [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]] (WMATA) operates the [[Washington Metro]], the city's [[rapid transit]] system, as well as [[Metrobus (Washington, D.C.)|Metrobus]]. Both systems serve the District and its suburbs.

Three major airports serve the District. [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]] is across the Potomac River from downtown Washington in [[Arlington, Virginia]] and primarily handles domestic flights. Major international flights arrive and depart from [[Washington Dulles International Airport]], {{convert|26.3|mi|km}} west of the District in [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax]] and [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun]] counties in Virginia. [[Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport]] is {{convert|31.7|mi|km}} northeast of the District in [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland]].

An expected 32% increase in transit usage within the District by 2030 has spurred construction of a new [[DC Streetcar]] system to interconnect the city's neighborhoods.<ref>{{cite web|title=History&nbsp;<U+2013> DC Streetcar|url=http://www.dcstreetcar.com/about/information/history/|publisher=District Department of Transportation|accessdate=2013-04-28}}</ref> Construction has also started on an additional [[Silver Line (Washington Metro)|Metro line]] that will connect Washington to Dulles airport.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dulles Metrorail Project Overview|url=http://www.dullesmetro.com/about/index.cfm.html|publisher=Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority|accessdate=2012-12-02}}</ref> The District is part of the regional [[Capital Bikeshare]] program.

== Notes ==
{{Refbegin|30em}}
{{note|debts|[a]}} By 1790, the Southern states had largely repaid their overseas debts from the Revolutionary War. The Northern states had not, and wanted the federal government to take over their outstanding liabilities. Southern Congressmen agreed to the plan in return for establishing the new national capital at their preferred site on the Potomac River.<ref name=Crew124 /><br />
{{note|geog|[b]}}The Residence Act allowed the President to select a location within Maryland as far east as the Anacostia River. However, Washington shifted the federal territory's borders to the southeast in order to include the city of Alexandria at the District's southern tip. In 1791, Congress amended the Residence Act to approve the new site, including territory ceded by Virginia.<ref name=Crew89 /><br />
{{note|popdata|[c]}}Until 1890, the U.S. Census Bureau counted the City of Washington, Georgetown, and unincorporated portions of Washington County as three separate areas. The data provided in this article from before 1890 are calculated as if the District of Columbia were a single municipality as it is today. Population data for each city prior to 1890 are available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/twps0027.html |title=Population of the 100 Largest Cities and Other Urban Places in the United States: 1790 to 1990 |accessdate=2008-07-29 |last=Gibson |first=Campbell |month=June | year=1998 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] }}</ref>
