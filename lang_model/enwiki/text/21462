'''Geoffrey''' (sometimes '''Geoffrey Plantagenet''',<ref name=Reign284>Turner and Heiser ''Reign of Richard Lionheart'' p. 284</ref> '''Geoffrey fitzPlantagenet''',<ref name=Wahlgren1205>Wahlgren "Peter of Blois" ''English Historical Review'' p. 1205</ref> or '''Geoffrey fitzRoy''';<ref name=Becket325>Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' p. 325</ref> ''[[circa|c.]]'' 1152 <U+2013> 12 December 1212) was an illegitimate son of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], King of England, who became [[Bishop of Lincoln|Bishop-elect of Lincoln]] and [[Archbishop of York]]. The identity of his mother is uncertain, but she may have been named Ykenai. Geoffrey held a number of minor clerical offices before becoming Bishop of Lincoln in 1173, although he was not ordained a priest until 1189. In 1173<U+2013>1174 he led a campaign in the north of England to help put down a rebellion by his legitimate half-brothers; this campaign led to the capture of the King of Scots. By 1182 Pope [[Pope Lucius III|Lucius III]] had ordered that Geoffrey either resign Lincoln or be [[consecration|consecrated]]; he chose to resign, and became [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor]] instead. He was the only one of Henry II's sons present at the king's death.

Geoffrey's half-brother [[Richard I of England|Richard I]], also known as "Richard Lionheart", nominated him Archbishop of York after succeeding to the throne of England, probably to force him to become a priest and thus eliminate a potential rival for the throne. After some dispute Geoffrey was consecrated archbishop in 1191. He soon became embroiled in a conflict with [[William Longchamp]], Richard's regent in England, after being detained at Dover on his return to England following his consecration in France. Geoffrey claimed [[sanctuary]] in the town, but he was seized by agents of Longchamp and briefly imprisoned in [[Dover Castle]]. Subsequently a council of magnates ordered Longchamp out of office, and Geoffrey was able to proceed to his archdiocese. The archbishop spent much of his archiepiscopate in various disputes with his half-brothers: first Richard and then [[John of England|John]], Richard's successor to the English throne in 1199. Geoffrey also quarrelled with his [[suffragan bishop]]s, his [[cathedral chapter]], and other clergy in his [[diocese]]. His last quarrel with John was in 1207, when the archbishop refused to allow the collection of a tax and was driven into exile in France, where he died five years later.

==Early life==

Geoffrey was probably born in about 1152,<ref name=BHOYork>Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=8457 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: Volume 6: York: Archbishops]''</ref> before his father Henry, later Henry II of England, married [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]],<ref name=HenryII78>Warren ''Henry II'' p. 78 note 1</ref>{{#tag:ref|Henry also held the duchies of [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] and [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] and the counties of [[County of Maine|Maine]], [[Touraine]] and [[County of Anjou|Anjou]] in France.<ref name=Handbook36/> These lands were central to Henry's power and he spent much time outside England in his continental possessions.<ref name=Clanchy99>Clanchy ''England and its Rulers'' pp. 99<U+2013>101</ref> King [[Richard I of England|Richard]], who succeeded Henry in 1189, also spent most of his time outside England.<ref name=Clanchy118>Clanchy ''England and its Rulers'' pp. 118<U+2013>119</ref> Although [[John of England|John]], Richard's younger brother who became king in 1199, lost Normandy, he still retained the other possessions and continued to spend much time on the continent.<ref name=Clanchy178>Clanchy ''England and its Rulers'' pp. 178<U+2013>180</ref>|group=Notes}} and was likely named after his paternal grandfather, [[Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]].<ref name=DNB/> Although he is often given the surname "Plantagenet" in modern histories, that name was not in use during his lifetime.<ref name=Bastards103>Given-Wilson and Curteis ''Royal Bastards'' pp. 103<U+2013>104</ref> The date of his birth is determined by statements of [[Gerald of Wales]] that he was barely 20 when he was elected bishop in 1173 and by the fact that he was about 40 when he was consecrated archbishop in 1191. His mother's identity is unclear. The medieval chronicler [[Walter Map]] claimed she was a whore named Ykenai, and that he was not actually Henry's son.{{#tag:ref|Her name is sometimes spelled Hikenai.<ref name=Bastards103/>|group=Notes}} This is the only contemporary source that gives her name, and as Map was hostile to Geoffrey, the information must be judged carefully.<ref name=DNB/> Instead, Ykenai may have been a daughter of a knight.<ref name=Bastards103/> Another possibility for Geoffrey's mother is [[Rosamund Clifford]], but most of the evidence for this is circumstantial.{{#tag:ref|In 1191 Geoffrey was irate at the destruction of Rosamund's shrine at [[Godstow|Godstow Abbey]]. Geoffrey was also fond of Godstow for his entire life, and while archbishop attempted to add [[Medieval parish churches of York#St Clement, Clementhorpe|Clementhorpe Priory]] to the endowment of Godstow. Another piece of circumstantial evidence is the name Map gives for Geoffrey's mother. It is possible that Ykenai is derived from Acquigny, and [[Acquigny Castle]] was likely held by members of the Clifford family. Further, [[William II Longesp<U+00E9>e|William Longesp<U+00E9>e]], the son of another reputed child of Rosamund, tried to claim land near Akeny in 1228.<ref name=DNB/>|group=Notes}} It is assumed that Geoffrey was the eldest of Henry's children, legitimate or illegitimate.<ref name=Bastards103/>{{#tag:ref|Geoffrey should not be confused with Henry's legitimate son [[Geoffrey, Duke of Brittany]], who was born in 1158 and died in 1186.<ref name=Handbook36>Fryde, et al.

Geoffrey was brought up with Henry's legitimate children. There is no evidence that Henry tried to deny Geoffrey's paternity,<ref name=DNB/> although Walter Map said that Henry's acknowledgment was done "improperly and with little discretion".<ref name=QJones28>Quoted in Jones "Generation Gap" ''Albion'' p. 28</ref> Geoffrey had a brother named Peter,<ref name=DNB/> who appears to have been his maternal half-brother,<ref name=Bastards118>Given-Wilson and Curteis ''Royal Bastards'' p. 118</ref> as Peter is generally considered unlikely to have been Henry's son.<ref name=Bastards179>Given-Wilson and Curteis ''Royal Bastards'' p. 179</ref>{{#tag:ref|Peter is called Geoffrey's "half-brother" by the historian Diana Greenway, but she does not state whether or not he was Geoffrey's maternal or paternal half-brother.<ref name=BHOArchYork>Greenway ''[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=6444 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: Volume 6: York: Archdeacons of York]''</ref> Peter is not mentioned by Henry's biographer as a son of the king.<ref name=Warren78>Warren ''Henry II'' p. 78 footnote 1</ref>|group=Notes}}

Geoffrey was [[Archdeacon of Lincoln]] in the [[diocese of Lincoln]] by September 1171, and probably retained that office until he was confirmed as bishop-elect in 1175.<ref name=BHOArchDLinc>Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=33566 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: Volume 3: Lincoln: Archdeacons of Lincoln]''</ref> He also held a [[prebendary|prebend]],<ref name=DNB/> an income from land owned by a cathedral chapter,<ref name=McGurk32>McGurk ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms'' p. 32</ref> in the [[diocese of London]], but there is little evidence that he executed the duties of either office. There are some indications that he studied [[canon law]] at a school in [[Northampton]], and that he taught in Paris during the early 1170s. He also acted as a [[papal judge-delegate]] at that time.<ref name=DNB/> Pope [[Pope Alexander III|Alexander III]] initially refused to confirm Geoffrey's selection as Bishop of Lincoln in about May 1173, prompting Geoffrey to travel to Rome in October 1174 to secure confirmation of this office. He was confirmed in the office of bishop by July 1175, but he was not [[ordination|ordained]] at that time,<ref name=BHOLinc>Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=33560 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: Volume 3: Lincoln: Bishops of Lincoln]''</ref> as he was under the canonical age for holding a bishopric.<ref name=Morey37>Morey ''Bartholomew of Exeter'' p. 37</ref> Geoffrey's youth was one of Alexander's objections to Geoffrey's election, and the pope only confirmed the office under duress.<ref name=DNB/> Another potential problem was Geoffrey's illegitimacy, which normally disbarred a person from holding ecclesiastical office, but that was dealt with by the granting of a papal dispensation.<ref name=Roger215>Cheney ''Roger of Worcester'' p. 215</ref>

In 1173 and early 1174 Geoffrey fought a military campaign in northern England in support of his father's attempts to subdue the Scots, who were supporting the [[Revolt of 1173<U+2013>1174|rebellion]] by Geoffrey's legitimate half-brothers against their father. The campaign resulted in the capture of [[William I of Scotland|William the Lion]], the [[List of Scottish monarchs|King of Scots]], and also helped to compel [[Hugh de Puiset|Hugh du Puiset]], the [[Bishop of Durham]], to pledge fealty to Henry II.<ref name=DNB>Lovatt "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10535 Geoffrey (1151?<U+2013>1212)]" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> During the campaign, Geoffrey captured a number of castles held by [[Roger Mowbray]], a supporter of the Scottish king.<ref name=Hugh38>Scammell ''Hugh du Puiset'' pp. 38<U+2013>39</ref> It was after this campaign that Henry said of Geoffrey "My other sons are the real bastards. ... This is the only one who's proved himself legitimate!"<ref name=QDNB>Quoted in Lovatt "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10535 Geoffrey (1151?<U+2013>1212)]" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> After Geoffrey was confirmed as bishop by Pope Alexander in 1175, the bishop-elect made a ceremonial visit to Lincoln on 1 August 1175. He subsequently went to study at [[Tours]], where he probably befriended [[Peter of Blois]], a medieval poet and diplomat who dedicated a later work on St [[Wilfrid]] to Geoffrey. The bishop-elect made a number of gifts to the cathedral at Lincoln, including two bells for the bell tower.<ref name=DNB/> While Geoffrey was the bishop-elect at Lincoln, it appears that [[Adam Parvipontanus|Adam, Bishop of St Asaph]] carried out the episcopal duties in the diocese of Lincoln, as Geoffrey had not been [[consecration|consecrated]] and was unable to perform those functions.<ref name=Richardson599>Richardson "Schools of Northampton" ''English Historical Review'' p. 599</ref> Nevertheless he managed to recover some lands of the diocese that had been lost as well as redeeming pawned ecclesiastical items. Although he aided the finances of his diocese with these recoveries, in 1180 he taxed his diocese heavily enough to earn him a rebuke from his father. In 1181 Pope Lucius III became concerned that Geoffrey was never going to be ordained or consecrated, and demanded that the bishop-elect's position be regularised, either through consecration as bishop or through resignation.<ref name=DNB/>

==Chancellor==
[[File:Richard3.jpg|thumb|Richard I of England (right) and Philip II of France (left), from a 14th-century illuminated manuscript|300px]]

Geoffrey formally resigned the [[Diocese of Lincoln|see of Lincoln]] on 6 January 1182,<ref name=Handbook255>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 255</ref> at [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]] in England, rather than be ordained as Pope Lucius III had ordered.<ref name=DNB/> Henry had named him [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor]] of England in 1181,<ref name=Handbook84>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 84</ref> after Geoffrey indicated he was going to resign the bishopric in February 1181.<ref name=DNB/>{{#tag:ref|This took the form of a ceremony of resignation, although the formal date of his resignation was not until the second ceremony in England in 1182.<ref name=DNB/>|group=Notes}} Although Geoffrey resigned the episcopal office, he continued to hold a number of [[benefice]]s in [[Benefice#Pluralism|plurality]],<ref name=BHOTreasYork/> which was the holding of more than one clerical office at the same time, something normally contrary to canon law.<ref name=Hamilton39>Hamilton ''Religion in the Medieval West'' p. 39</ref> These offices included the [[Treasurer of York]] from 1182, the Archdeaconry of Rouen from 1183,<ref name=BHOTreasYork>Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=7541 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: Volume 6: York: Treasurers of York]''</ref> and probably the [[Archdeaconry of East Riding]].<ref name=BHOPrebend>Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=2951 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: Volume 6: York: Prebends of York]''</ref> Henry also gave him two continental castles, one in Anjou and one in Touraine, along with lands in England and Normandy worth 1000 [[mark (money)|marks]] a year. Although Geoffrey held the office of Chancellor, he appears in only few documents, mainly between 1182 and 1185. After 1185 he does not appear in any contemporary documents until 1187, and it is possible that he spent some time outside his father's domains. Peter of Blois wrote that a number of monarchs considered Geoffrey as a possible successor for their kingdoms in Italy or the Holy Land,<ref name=DNB/> and that he was actually offered the throne of [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] by [[Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem|Heraclius]], the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]].<ref name=Wahlgren1212>Wahlgren "Peter of Blois" ''English Historical Review'' p. 1212</ref> It is possible that Geoffrey's non-appearance in documents was due to his absence from his father's domains in pursuit of these ambitions. During Geoffrey's term of office as Chancellor [[Walter de Coutances]] served as his "seal-keeper"; the need for someone to perform this function adds further evidence to the likelihood that Geoffrey's time as Chancellor was spent on unrelated duties for his father.<ref name=DNB/>

Following the declaration of war on Henry by Prince [[Richard I of England|Richard]] and King [[Philip II of France]] in 1187, Geoffrey was given command of a quarter of the English royal army. He and his father were driven from [[Le Mans]], Henry's birth place, in 1189.<ref name=DNB/> Geoffrey did not attend the subsequent conference at which Henry submitted to Philip immediately before Henry's death, unwilling to witness his father's humiliation, but he did help nurse him during his final days. Henry made a bedside wish that Geoffrey be made either Archbishop of York or [[Bishop of Winchester]], and Geoffrey used his father's seal to make appointments to York after Henry's death. Geoffrey then escorted Henry's body to [[Fontevrault Abbey]] for burial.<ref name=DNB/> He was the only one of Henry II's sons present at his death.<ref name=Lyon233>Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' pp. 233<U+2013>236</ref>

==Archbishop==

===First difficulties===

Richard named Geoffrey Archbishop of York on 20 July 1189,<ref name=Elections4>Turner "Richard Lionheart and English Episcopal Elections" ''Albion'' p. 4</ref> within days of taking the throne; the formal election took place on 10 August.<ref name=DNB/> What happened with the vacant archbishopric of York after Richard took the throne, and why, as well as the exact chronology of events, is complicated by the contradictory nature of the main contemporary accounts. Gerald of Wales states that Geoffrey was reluctant to accept York, but another chronicler, [[Benedict of Peterborough]] relates that Geoffrey quickly took control of the archiepiscopal estates.<ref name=DNB/> However the election occurred, Geoffrey's consecration did not take place until much later,<ref name=Handbook281/> and soon after his election, he either resigned or was stripped of his office of Chancellor.<ref name=Handbook84/> A further complication was the fact that the cathedral chapter had earlier elected the [[Dean of York]], [[Hubert Walter]], as archbishop.<ref name=Elections4/>

Richard probably gave York to Geoffrey in the hope of forcing him to become a full priest, and thus eliminate a potential rival for the throne.<ref name=John39>Warren ''King John'' p. 39</ref><ref name=Turner35>Turner ''King John'' pp. 35<U+2013>36</ref> Richard also required Geoffrey to swear that he would remain outside England for three years during the time Richard expected to be out of the country on crusade. The king subsequently released Geoffrey from the oath, the initial swearing of which was apparently another of Richard's efforts to keep Geoffrey's possible ambitions towards the English throne in check.<ref name=Reign89>Turner and Heiser ''Reign of Richard Lionheart'' pp. 89<U+2013>90</ref> But the cathedral chapter at York disputed Geoffrey's appointment, claiming that because the Dean of York, Hubert Walter, and some others of the chapter had not been present, the election was invalid.<ref name=DNB/> Walter's election to York was supported by Richard's mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, whom a chronicler claimed hated Geoffrey as the product of one of her husband's affairs.<ref name=Elections4/> Richard consequently retained his control over the estates of the archbishopric, and did not confirm the election until a council held at [[Pipewell]] on 16&nbsp;September.<ref name=DNB/> At that council Richard also appointed three men to offices within the [[diocese of York]]: he made [[Henry Marshal]] the dean; [[Burchard du Puiset]], a relative of Hugh du Puiset,{{#tag:ref|Burchard is called variously the nephew<ref name=DNB/> or the son of Hugh by modern historians.<ref name=Reign95>Turner and Heiser ''Reign of Richard Lionheart'' p. 95</ref>|group=Notes}} became treasurer; and [[Roger of London]] the abbot of [[Selby Abbey]]. Geoffrey objected to these appointments, and as a result his estates were confiscated by the king until he submitted and became a priest.<ref name=DNB/> The historians Ralph Turner and Richard Heiser speculate that Richard's strategy in making these appointments was to keep Geoffrey distracted by problems within his diocese, and thus unable to challenge for the English throne. The two historians also suggest that Richard may have been making an example of Geoffrey, in a demonstration that he could be harsh even with his own relatives.<ref name=Reign89/>

Geoffrey's ordination as a priest took place at [[Southwell, Nottinghamshire|Southwell]] on 23 September 1189,<ref name=BHOYork/> in a ceremony performed by [[John of Whithorn|John]] the [[Bishop of Whithorn]]. Geoffrey then went to York, but until his election was ratified by the pope he refused to allow Burchard to take up his office. This stance was supported by most of the York cathedral chapter. Geoffrey then was sent by Richard to escort William the Lion from Scotland to Canterbury. It was at Canterbury that papal assent to Geoffrey's election was secured in December, when [[Giovanni Conti da Anagni|Giovanni di Anagni]], the [[papal legate]], not only confirmed the election, but rejected the various appeals made by the cathedral chapter against Geoffrey. But the king forced Geoffrey to allow the royal appointments, and pay a fine of <U+00A3>2000 before his lands were restored, although Geoffrey was allowed some time to make the full payment.<ref name=DNB/>{{#tag:ref|Gerald of Wales relates a story that Richard changed the text of the agreement from the agreed-upon 2000 [[Mark (money)|mark]]s to <U+00A3>2000, thus increasing the amount Geoffrey owed by a third.<ref name=Hugh177>Scammell ''Hugh du Puiset'' p. 177</ref>|group=Notes}}

In early 1190 Geoffrey ordered a halt to religious ceremonies in the cathedral and excommunicated Henry Marshal and Burchard in retaliation for a dispute during an earlier church service. Richard, who was in Normandy preparing to go on the [[Third Crusade]], ordered Geoffrey to the king's presence in Normandy. Although Hugh du Puiset, who was [[Justiciar]], was hampering Geoffrey's attempts to collect revenue for the earlier find, Richard insisted on the full payment on the spot. When Geoffrey was unable to to this, Richard re-confiscated Geoffrey's lands, increased the amount of the fine, and demanded a promise that Geoffrey would not visit England for three years. The dispute was settled once more when the pope stepped in and ratified Geoffrey's election, thus enabling a reconciliation between the king and the archbishop at Tours in June. Geoffrey's estates were returned to him in July, after paying 800 marks of his fine.<ref name=DNB/>

===Consecration and more difficulties===
[[File:Castle Dover1 cz.jpg|thumb|left|Dover Castle, where Geoffrey was briefly imprisoned|300px]]

Geoffrey was consecrated on 18 August 1191,<ref name=Handbook281>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 281</ref> at Tours in France, by [[Barthelemy de Vend<U+00F4>me|Bartholomew]], the [[Archbishop of Tours]], after the papacy agreed to allow the consecration. This permission was secured by the intervention of the king and his mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine.<ref name=DNB/> Turner and Heiser see the presumed motivation behind Eleanor and Richard's support as part of an effort to secure a counter-weight to the power exercised in England by the Chancellor, William Longchamp, about whom complaints had reached Richard in Sicily.<ref name=Reign123>Turner and Heiser ''Reign of Richard Lionheart'' p. 123</ref> Geoffrey received his [[pallium]], the symbol of an archbishop's authority, at his consecration.<ref name=BHOYork/> In September 1191, after the consecration,<ref name=DNB/> he attempted to go to York, but was met at [[Dover]] by agents of Longchamp, and even though he took refuge in the [[Dover Priory|priory of St. Martin in Dover]], was dragged from [[Sanctuary#Legal Sanctuary|sanctuary]] and imprisoned in Dover Castle.<ref name=John42>Warren ''King John'' p. 42</ref> Longchamp claimed that Geoffrey had not sworn [[fealty]] to Richard, but this was probably just an excuse to eliminate a rival.<ref name=Lyon233/> Another complication was that the English bishops had appealed to the papacy because Geoffrey had not been consecrated by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Longchamp could therefore claim to have been acting on behalf of the other bishops in ordering Geoffrey's arrest.<ref name=DNB/> But the actions of Longchamp's agents were considered excessive and there was soon an outcry against the Chancellor's arrest of Geoffrey, even though Longchamp claimed that his orders had been exceeded by his agents.<ref name=Reign126>Turner and Heiser ''Reign of Richard Lionheart'' pp. 126<U+2013>128</ref> The archbishop was released and took part in a council held at Loddon Bridge, between [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] and [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]]; Longchamp was excommunicated and deposed from the chancellorship,<ref name=Powell98>Powell and Wallis '' House of Lords'' pp. 98<U+2013>99</ref> and [[Hugh of Lincoln]], the Bishop of Lincoln, excommunicated those who had dragged Geoffrey from sanctuary.<ref name=DNB/> Geoffrey was then enthroned at York on 1 November 1191.<ref name=BHOYork/>

While still embroiled in his conflict with Longchamp, Geoffrey began feuding with Hugh du Puiset, probably over Geoffrey's authority in Puiset's diocese of Durham, one of those subject to York. The dispute dragged on for years, with many appeals to Rome and the king.<ref name=DNB/> York had been vacant for a number of years, and Puiset had grown used to having untrammeled authority in the northern archdiocese.<ref name=Hugh172>Scammell ''Hugh du Puiset'' p. 172</ref> After Geoffrey's consecration, he summoned Puiset to a [[provincial synod]] in late September 1191, at which the bishop was charged with various irregularities. Puiset appealed to Rome and refused to attend the synod, and was excommunicated in December by Geoffrey. An attempt in March 1192 by Queen Eleanor and Hubert Walter to settle the issue came to nothing when Geoffrey insisted on a pledge of obedience from Puiset, who in turn demanded an admission from Geoffrey that the excommunication had been unjust. Further appeals to Rome led to an eventual settlement in October 1192, when the bishop finally acknowledged Geoffrey's authority over Durham.<ref name=Hugh178>Scammell ''Hugh du Puiset'' pp. 178<U+2013>181</ref>

Geoffrey caused offence by his attempts to have his episcopal cross carried before him in the diocese of Canterbury, thus implying that his diocese was superior or at least equal to Canterbury in rank.<ref name=DNB/> In pursuit of this rivalry between York and Canterbury, Geoffrey was the first archbishop of York to style himself "primate of England", in opposition to the Canterbury title of "primate of all England".<ref name=Cheney52>Cheney ''Hubert Walter'' pp. 52<U+2013>53</ref>{{#tag:ref|The rivalry, usually known as the [[Canterbury<U+2013>York dispute]],<ref name=Bethell156>Bethell "William of Corbeil" ''Journal of Ecclesiastical History'' pp. 156<U+2013>157</ref> began shortly after the [[Norman Conquest of England]] and did not end until the 14th century.<ref name=Struggle99>Carpenter ''Struggle for Mastery'' p. 99</ref><ref name=Young88>Young ''Hubert Walter'' pp. 88<U+2013>89</ref>|group=Notes}} He also attempted to subordinate [[Medieval parish churches of York#St Clement, Clementhorpe|Clementhorpe Priory]] to [[Godstow|Godstow Abbey]], which provoked an appeal from Prioress Alice of Clementhorpe to the papacy.<ref name=DNB/> Probably owing to Pope [[Pope Celestine III|Celestine III]]'s dislike of Geoffrey, Hubert Walter was given a papal legateship that included Geoffrey's province, something that had not been usual in the preceding years, and which presented Geoffrey with some difficulties in his dealings with the ecclesiastical hierarchy.<ref name=Papacy>Robinson ''Papacy'' p. 173</ref> But Geoffrey was on friendly terms with Prince John; the historian G. V. Scammell has suggested that Geoffrey's consecration allowed John to feel that Geoffrey was no longer a rival for the throne, thus paving the way for good relations between the two half-brothers.<ref name=Hugh55>Scammell ''Hugh du Puiset'' p. 55</ref>

Geoffrey long faced opposition from some members of his cathedral chapter led by Henry Marshal, Burchard du Puiset, and Roger of London. They objected to his having given a large part of York's treasury towards Richard's ransom,{{#tag:ref|Richard was held captive in Germany while returning from crusade and was only released after the payment of a ransom, which was 150,000 [[mark (money)|mark]]s. To raise this sum, all of Richard's subjects were taxed at the rate of 25% for both their incomes and their possessions. These payments were required from both laymen and the clergy.<ref name=Clanchy118/>|group=Notes}} and to some of his appointments in the church of York. Charges of [[simony]], extortion, and neglect of his duties were lodged against Geoffrey, who in return excommunicated the ringleaders more than once, and locked the [[Canon (priest)|canons]] out of church. Geoffrey also faced difficulties with his appointees to the office of Dean of York; his first choice, his half-brother Peter, was opposed by the cathedral chapter. Geoffrey's second choice, [[Simon of Apulia]], the chancellor of York, refused to give up the office when Geoffrey decided to award it to a third man, [[Philip of Poitou]]. Simon was supported by the cathedral chapter, who elected him to the office despite Geoffrey's opposition. An appeal was made to the papacy by Geoffrey while Simon traveled to King Richard in Germany. The king refused to allow the appeal and tried to summon Geoffrey to Germany to resolve the issue. Geoffrey was unable to leave York because of disturbances within the cathedral clergy, and Simon managed to secure papal confirmation as Dean of York.<ref name=DNB/>

===Quarrels with John, Hubert Walter and Richard===

When Prince [[John of England|John]] rebelled in 1193, Geoffrey and Hugh du Puiset put aside their feud to quash the uprising. Geoffrey strengthened [[Doncaster]]'s defences and went to the aid of Puiset, who was besieging [[Tickhill Castle]].<ref name=DNB/> In 1194 Geoffrey went into debt to the crown for the sum of 3000 marks to buy the office of [[High Sheriff of Yorkshire|Sheriff of Yorkshire]] for himself.<ref name=RichardI270>Gillingham ''Richard I'' p. 270</ref> Later that year Geoffrey began to quarrel with Hubert Walter over the [[Canterbury-York dispute|primacy]] of England, which Canterbury claimed and York disputed. Walter's decision to have his episcopal cross carried before him in the diocese of York in March 1194 was symbolic of his claim to primacy over York and all of England. Geoffrey responded by having his own cross carried before him in the diocese of Canterbury the following month. Richard did not reprimand Geoffrey for this act of provocation, and even went so far as to restore some of his confiscated estates. Before Richard left England in May 1194 he appointed Walter as Justiciar; that summer Walter began an investigation into Geoffrey's actions, which led to Geoffrey's estates being confiscated once again. Geoffrey appealed to the king, who was then in [[County of Maine|Maine]]; Richard overruled Walter, restored Geoffrey's estates, and pardoned him in return for a payment of 1000 marks and the promise of 1000 more to follow.<ref name=DNB/>

In January 1195 Geoffrey was ordered to appear in Rome to answer various charges, under the threat of suspension from office if he did not appear by 1 June. Further quarrels with his cathedral clergy followed, including an instance of the cathedral chapter throwing [[chrism]] on a dungheap in protest. Geoffrey protested to the king after Richard forbade Geoffrey's projected journey to Rome and in retaliation the king confiscated Geoffrey's estates once more. This left Geoffrey vulnerable when Walter held a [[legatine council]] at York in June 1195. Geoffrey had managed to secure a postponement of his case at Rome until 1 November, but was still unable to attend, which led Pope Celestine to order that Geoffrey's suspension should be performed by Hugh of Lincoln. Hugh protested, and as a result Celestine himself suspended Geoffrey on 23&nbsp;December 1195, finally forcing Geoffrey to answer the charges against him. He traveled to Rome in 1196, where his accusers were unable to substantiate their claims and he was restored to office by the pope.<ref name=DNB/>

Geoffrey quarrelled with Richard in 1196 in Normandy while the archbishop was attempting to return to England.<ref name=DNB/> Richard forbade him from administering York,<ref name=Lyon305>Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' pp. 305<U+2013>306</ref> and Geoffrey returned to Rome until 1198. An attempt at reconciliation with Richard came to nothing, after Geoffrey refused to approve the king's appointments in the diocese of York without some guarantees that they would be approved by the papacy. Ultimately Pope [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] on 28&nbsp;April 1199 ordered that Geoffrey was to be restored to his lands as soon as he had paid his debts to the king. Innocent further ordered that any royal appointments in York would require papal approval.<ref name=DNB/>

==Under John==

After John succeeded Richard in 1199, he decided to restore Geoffrey to the archiepiscopal estates, but continued to receive the income until the archbishop returned from Rome.<ref name=Hindsight13>Gillingham "Historians without Hindsight" ''King John'' p. 13</ref> A number of Geoffrey's opponents who were officials in his diocese resigned their offices, and for a short time peace reigned in York. But the perceived arrogance of Geoffrey's officials offended the cathedral chapter at York, and this further conflict was not resolved until March 1200. For most of the remainder of 1199 Geoffrey was frequently with the king, and the two appear to have been on good terms, a state of affairs that continued throughout the first half of 1200.<ref name=DNB/>

In October 1200 Geoffrey refused to allow the collection of [[carucage]], a tax on land, on his property, and his lands were confiscated in retaliation.<ref name=DNB/> He then excommunicated the new sheriff of Yorkshire, [[James of Poterne]], who had ravaged Geoffrey's lands in revenge.<ref name=Joliffe114/> In November 1200, Geoffrey and John were reconciled at Hugh of Lincoln's funeral, which allowed Geoffrey to regain his confiscated estates, but the archbishop's continued refusal to allow the collection of carucage led to the truce falling apart.<ref name=DNB/> In January 1201, John made peace with his half brother,<ref name=Joliffe114>Joliffe ''Angevin Kingship'' pp.114<U+2013>115</ref> but it did not last, as Geoffrey continued to refuse to allow the tax to be collected. John then renewed the demand for the payment for the office of sheriff due from Richard's reign, which forced Geoffrey to rescind his excommunication and offer another payment in return for peace, which occurred in May 1201. But it was short-lived; disputes over the appointments in the diocese of York broke out, but with the support of Pope Innocent Geoffrey was able to secure the appointment of a few of his own candidates. Geoffrey also quarrelled with some of the monasteries in his diocese, with the usual claims and counterclaims going to the papacy for judgement. Among the religious houses Geoffrey had disagreements with were [[Guisborough Priory]], [[Meaux Abbey]], and [[Fountains Abbey]]. Most of these conflicts arose from disputed appointments to offices, but the quarrel with Meaux involved claims of tithe exemption by that house.<ref name=DNB/>

Geoffrey submitted to John in 1206, and his lands were returned to him.<ref name=DNB/> But in 1207 Geoffrey led the clergy of England in their refusal to pay royal taxation and was forced into exile.<ref name=John149>Warren ''King John'' p. 149</ref> Geoffrey excommunicated anyone who attempted to collect the tax in his archdiocese, but the king confiscated Geoffrey's estates in retaliation.<ref name=Tax177>Mitchell ''Taxation in Medieval England'' pp. 177<U+2013>178</ref> Geoffrey once again secured the support of Pope Innocent, who ordered John to restore Geoffrey's possessions, but in the meantime the archbishop had fled to France. A medieval chronicler, [[Geoffrey of Coldingham]], stated that the English church considered Geoffrey a martyr because of this stand against King John.<ref name=DNB/>

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Saint Louis Psalter 17 recto.jpg|thumb|Scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ]]'' in the [[Psalter of St. Louis|Leiden St Louis Psalter]] made for Geoffrey|upright|260px]]

Geoffrey died while still in exile at Grandmont in [[Normandy]] on 12 December 1212.<ref name=BHOYork/><ref name=Handbook281/> He was buried at a [[Grandmontine]] monastery near Rouen,<ref name=BHOYork/><ref name=DNB/> where he had been living for a few years.<ref name=Hallam171>Hallam "Henry II, Richard I and the order of Grandmont" ''Journal of Medieval History'' p. 171</ref> His tomb was still extant in 1767, when the inscription on it was recorded by an antiquary. He may have become a monk before his death.<ref name=DNB/>

Although his archiepiscopate was mainly marked by the number of conflicts in which he engaged, Geoffrey also managed to institute some administrative reforms in his diocese, creating the office of chancellor. He also inspired loyalty from a number of his household members, many of whom witnessed his charters, and although he made enemies of a number of the suffragan bishops, clergy and religious houses in his diocese, he also secured the friendship and support of other clergy, including Pope Innocent III and Hugh of Lincoln. Although Walter Map declared that Geoffrey was "full of faults and devoid of character",<ref name=QJones28/> he remained loyal to his father until Henry's death. A modern-day historian, Thomas Jones, summed up Geoffrey's character with the phrase "quarrelsome and undiplomatic".<ref name=Jones28>Jones "Generation Gap" ''Albion'' p. 28</ref> Another historian, J. C. Holt, stated that Geoffrey was through his career "a perpetual source of danger, quarrelling now with de Puiset, now with the Yorkshire sheriffs, ever ready to attack the judicial and fiscal superiority of the Crown."<ref name=Holt204>Holt ''Northerners'' p. 204</ref>

Geoffrey's ambitions may have included becoming King of England, which may account for some of the harshness that his two legitimate half-brothers displayed towards him. His military abilities, displayed in the rebellion of 1173<U+2013>1174, as well his custody of castles near Tours, would have also fed into Richard's disquiet over Geoffrey's possible intentions.<ref name=Reign77>Turner and Heiser ''Reign of Richard Lionheart'' pp. 77<U+2013>78</ref> Geoffrey was known to be ambitious, which led the historian D. L. Douie to call him a "formidable bastard".<ref name=QReign77>Quoted in Turner and Heiser ''Reign of Richard Lionheart'' p. 77</ref> The historian Ralph Turner said of Geoffrey that "he sought power and wealth despite the handicap of his birth" and that he had "inherited the bad temper of the other Plantagenets".<ref name=Courts84>Turner ''King and His Courts'' p. 84</ref>

Geoffrey was a patron of scholarship, and employed a number of scholars throughout his life,<ref name=DNB/> one of whom, [[Honorius of Kent]], Geoffrey appointed [[Archdeacon of Richmond]].<ref name=Cheney164>Cheney ''Hubert Walter'' pp. 164<U+2013>165</ref> Honorius was subsequently employed by Hubert Walter and wrote a legal work on canon law.<ref name=Walter57>Young ''Hubert Walter'' p. 57</ref> The [[Psalter of St. Louis|Leiden St Louis Psalter]]{{#tag:ref|It is in Latin on parchment containing 185 folios with 23 miniatures, now at Leiden in the University Library under catalogue MS. lat. 76A.<ref name=Morgan61/>|group=Notes}} is a lavishly illuminated [[psalter]] made for the archbishop, probably in northern England in the 1190s, which passed into the hands of [[Blanche of Castile]] after Geoffrey's death, and, as religious manuscripts often were, was used to teach the future saint King [[Louis IX of France]] how to read, as a 14th-century inscription records. After the king's death it passed through a number of royal owners, regarded as a relic of the saint, before reaching the [[Leiden University|University Library]] at [[Leiden]] in 1741.<ref name=Morgan61>Morgan ''Survey of Manuscripts'' pp. 61<U+2013>62</ref>
