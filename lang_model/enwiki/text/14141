'''Douglas Noel Adams''' (11 March 1952 <U+2013> 11 May 2001) was an English [[writer]], [[List of humorists|humorist]], and [[dramatist]]. He is best known as the author of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', which started life in 1978 as a BBC [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)|radio comedy]] before developing into a "trilogy" of five books that sold more than 15&nbsp;million copies in his lifetime, a [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|television series]], several stage plays, comics, a [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|computer game]], and in 2005 a [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|feature film]]. Adams's contribution to UK radio is commemorated in [[Radio Academy|The Radio Academy]]'s Hall of Fame.<ref name=radioacad>{{cite web|title=The Radio Academy Hall of Fame|url=http://www.radioacademy.org/hall-of-fame|work=The Radio Academy|publisher=The Radio Academy|accessdate=8 December 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/63mNGrql2|archivedate=8 December 2011|deadurl=no}}</ref>

Adams also wrote ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'' (1987) and ''[[The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul]]'' (1988), and co-wrote ''[[The Meaning of Liff]]'' (1983), ''[[Last Chance to See]]'' (1990), and three stories for the television series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. A posthumous collection of his work, including an unfinished novel, was published as ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'' in 2002.

Adams became known as an advocate for [[environmentalism]] and [[conservation movement|conservation]], and also as a lover of fast cars, cameras, [[technological innovation]], and the [[Apple Macintosh]]. He was a staunch [[atheist]], famously imagining a [[puddle thinking|sentient puddle]] who wakes up one morning and thinks, "This is an interesting world I find myself in<U+2014>an interesting hole I find myself in<U+2014>fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!" to demonstrate the fallacy of the [[fine-tuned Universe]] argument for God.<ref>Adams 1998; Dawkins 2003, p. 169.</ref> Biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] dedicated his book ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006) to Adams, writing on his death that "Science has lost a friend, literature has lost a luminary, the [[mountain gorilla]] and the [[black rhino]] have lost a gallant defender."<ref name=Dawkins2001>{{cite news|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|title=Lament for Douglas Adams|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2001/may/14/books.booksnews|accessdate=29 December 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 May 2001}}</ref>

==Early life==
<!-- Please leave this section heading as is, for the chronology of events. Adams's own family (wife and daughter) are discussed later. -->
Adams was born on 11 March 1952 to Janet (n<U+00E9>e Donovan) and Christopher Douglas Adams in [[Cambridge]], [[England]].<ref name=ODNB >Webb 2005b</ref> The following year [[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]] famously first modelled [[DNA]] at [[Cambridge University]], leading Adams to later quip he was DNA in Cambridge months earlier. The family moved to [[East End of London|East London]] a few months after his birth where his sister, Susan, was born three years later.<ref name=Adams_xix>{{Harvnb|Adams|2002|pp=xix}}</ref> His parents divorced in 1957; Douglas, Susan, and their mother moved to an [[RSPCA]] animal shelter in [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]], Essex, run by his maternal grandparents.<ref>Webb 2005a, p. 32.</ref>

===Education===
Adams attended Primrose Hill Primary School in Brentwood. At nine, he passed the entrance exam for [[Brentwood School (Essex)|Brentwood School]], an independent school whose alumni include [[Robin Day]], [[Jack Straw]], [[Noel Edmonds]], and [[David Irving]]. [[Griff Rhys Jones]] was a year below him, and he was in the same class as [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] artist [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]]. He attended the [[Preparatory school (UK)|prep school]] from 1959 to 1964, then the main school until December 1970. His form master, Frank Halford, said of him: "Hundreds of boys have passed through the school but Douglas Adams really stood out from the crowd<U+2014>literally. He was unnecessarily tall and in his short trousers he looked a trifle self-conscious.  "The form-master wouldn't say 'Meet under the clock tower,' or 'Meet under the war memorial'," he joked, "but 'Meet under Adams'."<ref name=Adams_7>{{Harvnb|Adams|2002|pp=7}}</ref><ref>Botti, Nicholas. [http://www.douglasadams.eu/en_bonus_interview_fh.php "Interview with Frank Halford"]. ''Life, DNA, and H2G2.'' 2009. Web. Retrieved 13 March 2012. (Click on link at bottom for facsimile page from ''Daily News'' article, 7 March 1998.)</ref> Yet it was his ability to write first-class stories that really made him shine."<ref name=Simpson_9>{{Harvnb|Simpson|2003|pp=9}}</ref>

Adams was six feet tall (1.83&nbsp;m) by age 12 and stopped growing at 6&nbsp;ft 5&nbsp;in (1.96&nbsp;m). He became the only student ever to be awarded a ten out of ten by Halford for creative writing, something he remembered for the rest of his life, particularly when facing [[writer's block]].<ref name=Adams_xix />

Some of his earliest writing was published at the school, such as a report on its photography club in ''The Brentwoodian'' in 1962, or spoof reviews in the school magazine ''Broadsheet'', edited by [[Paul Neil Milne Johnstone]], who later became a character in ''The Hitchhiker's Guide''. He also designed the cover of one issue of the ''Broadsheet'', and had a letter and short story published nationally in ''[[Eagle (comic)|The Eagle]]'', the boys' comic, in 1965. On the strength of a bravura essay on religious poetry that discussed [[the Beatles]] and [[William Blake]], he was awarded a place at [[St John's College, Cambridge]] to read English, going up in 1971. He wanted to join the [[Footlights]], an invitation-only student comedy club that has acted as a hothouse for some of the most notable comic talent in England. He was not elected immediately as he had hoped, and started to write and perform in revues with Will Adams (no relation) and Martin Smith, forming a group called "Adams-Smith-Adams," but managed to become a member of the Footlights by 1973.<ref name=Simpson_30-40>{{Harvnb|Simpson|2003|pp=30-40}}</ref>  Despite doing very little work<U+2014>he recalled having completed three essays in three years<U+2014>he graduated in 1974 with a B.A. in [[English literature]].<ref name=ODNB/>

==Career==
===Writing===
After leaving university Adams moved back to London, determined to break into TV and radio as a writer. An edited version of the ''Footlights Revue'' appeared on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] television in 1974. A version of the Revue performed live in London's [[West End of London|West End]] led to Adams being discovered by [[Monty Python]]'s [[Graham Chapman]]. The two formed a brief writing partnership, earning Adams a writing credit in [[List of Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes#6. Party Political Broadcast|episode 45]] of ''Monty Python'' for a sketch called "[[Patient Abuse]]". He is one of only two people outside the original Python members to get a writing credit (the other being [[Neil Innes]]).<ref name=times>{{cite news|title=Terry Jones remembers Douglas Adams, 'the last of the Pythons'|newspaper=The Times|date=10 October 2009}}</ref> The sketch plays on the idea of mind-boggling paper work in an emergency, a joke later incorporated into the [[Vogon|Vogons']] obsession with paperwork. Adams also contributed to a sketch on the album for ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''.

[[File:DNA in Monty Python.jpg|thumb|Douglas Adams in his first ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus|Monty Python]]'' appearance, in full surgeon's garb in [[List of Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes#3. The Light Entertainment War|episode]] [[Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything|42]].]]

Adams had two brief appearances in the fourth series of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''. At the beginning of [[List of Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes#3. The Light Entertainment War|episode 42]], "The Light Entertainment War", Adams is in a surgeon's mask (as Dr. Emile Koning, according to on-screen captions), pulling on gloves, while [[Michael Palin]] narrates a sketch that introduces one person after another but never actually gets started. At the beginning of episode 44, "Mr. Neutron", Adams is dressed in a "pepperpot" outfit and loads a missile on to a cart driven by [[Terry Jones]], who is calling for scrap metal ("Any old iron..."). The two episodes were broadcast in November 1974. Adams and Chapman also attempted non-Python projects, including ''[[Out of the Trees]]''.

At this point Adams's career stalled; his writing style was unsuited to the current style of radio and TV comedy.<ref name=ODNB /> To make ends meet he took a series of odd jobs, including as a hospital porter, barn builder, and chicken shed cleaner. He was employed as a bodyguard by a [[Qatar]]i family, who had made their fortune in oil. Anecdotes about the job included that the family had once ordered one of everything from a hotel's menu, tried all the dishes, and sent out for hamburgers. Another story had to do with a prostitute sent to the floor Adams was guarding one evening. They acknowledged each other as she entered, and an hour later, when she left, she is said to have remarked, "At least you can read while you're on the job."<ref>Webb 2005a, p. 93.</ref>

During this time Adams continued to write and submit sketches, though few were accepted. In 1976 his career had a brief improvement when he wrote and performed, to good review, ''Unpleasantness at Brodie's Close'' at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] festival. But by Christmas work had dried up again, and a depressed Adams moved to live with his mother.<ref name=ODNB /> The lack of writing work hit him hard and a low confidence would become a feature of Adams's life; "I have terrible periods of lack of confidence [..] I briefly did therapy, but after a while I realised it was like a farmer complaining about the weather. You can't fix the weather&nbsp;<U+2013> you just have to get on with it".<ref name=Adams_prologue>{{Harvnb|Adams|2002|pp=prologue}}</ref>

Some of Adams's early radio work included sketches for ''[[The Burkiss Way]]'' in 1977 and ''[[The News Huddlines]]''. He also wrote, again with Graham Chapman, the 20 February 1977 episode of ''Doctor on the Go'', a sequel to the ''[[Doctor in the House (TV series)|Doctor in the House]]'' television comedy series. After the first radio series of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide'' became successful, Adams was made a BBC radio producer, working on ''[[Week Ending]]'' and a pantomime called ''[[Black Cinderella Two Goes East]]''. He left the position after six months to become the script editor for ''[[Doctor Who]]''.

In 1979 Adams and [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]] wrote scripts for two half-hour episodes of ''[[Doctor Snuggles]]'': "The Remarkable Fidgety River" and "The Great Disappearing Mystery" (episodes seven and twelve). John Lloyd was also co-author of two episodes from the original ''Hitchhiker'' radio series ("Fit the Fifth" and "Fit the Sixth", also known as "Episode Five" and "Episode Six"), as well as ''[[The Meaning of Liff]]'' and ''[[The Deeper Meaning of Liff]]''. Lloyd and Adams also collaborated on a science fiction film comedy project based on ''[[The Guinness Book of World Records]]'', which would have starred [[John Cleese]] as the UN Secretary General, and had a race of aliens beating humans in athletic competitions, but the humans winning in all of the "absurd" record categories. The project never proceeded past a treatment.

====''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''====
{{Main|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy}}
''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' was a concept for a science-fiction comedy radio series pitched by Adams and radio producer [[Simon Brett]] to [[BBC Radio 4]] in 1977. Adams came up with an outline for a pilot episode, as well as a few other stories (reprinted in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s book ''[[Don't Panic: The Official Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Companion]]'') that could potentially be used in the series.
[[File:Towelday-Innsbruck.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Towel Day]] 2005 in Innsbruck, Austria, where Adams first had the idea of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide''. In the novels a towel is the most useful thing a space traveller can have.  The annual Towel Day (25 May) was first celebrated in 2001, two weeks after Adams's death.]]

According to Adams, the idea for the title occurred to him while he lay drunk in a field in [[Innsbruck]], Austria, gazing at the stars. He was carrying a copy of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to Europe'', and it occurred to him that "somebody ought to write a ''Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''". He later said that the constant repetition of this anecdote had obliterated his memory of the actual event.<ref>{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas| editor= Geoffrey Perkins (ed.), Additional Material by M. J. Simpson|title=[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Original Radio Scripts]] | page = 10 | edition =25th Anniversary Edition | publisher=Pan Books | year=2003 | isbn=0-330-41957-9}}</ref>

Despite the original outline, Adams was said to make up the stories as he wrote. He turned to [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]] for help with the final two episodes of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#The Primary Phase|the first series]]. Lloyd contributed bits from an unpublished science fiction book of his own, called ''GiGax''.<ref>Webb 2005a, p. 120.</ref> Very little of Lloyd's material survived in later adaptations of ''Hitchhiker's'', such as the novels and the TV series. The TV series itself was based on the first six radio episodes, and sections contributed by Lloyd were largely re-written.

[[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast the first radio series weekly in the UK in March and April 1978. The series was distributed in the United States by [[National Public Radio]].  Following the success of the first series, another episode was recorded and broadcast, which was commonly known as the Christmas Episode. [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#The Secondary Phase|A second series]] of five episodes was broadcast one per night, during the week of 21<U+2013>25 January 1980.

While working on the radio series (and with simultaneous projects such as ''[[The Pirate Planet]]'') Adams developed problems keeping to writing deadlines that only got worse as he published novels. Adams was never a prolific writer and usually had to be forced by others to do any writing. This included being locked in a hotel suite with his editor for three weeks to ensure that ''[[So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish]]'' was completed.<ref>Felch 2004</ref> He was quoted as saying, "I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by."<ref name=Simpson_236>{{Harvnb|Simpson|2003|pp=236}}</ref> Despite the difficulty with deadlines, Adams wrote five novels in the series, published in 1979, 1980, 1982, 1984, and 1992.

The books formed the basis for other adaptations, such as three-part comic book adaptations for each of the first three books, an interactive text-adventure [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|computer game]], and a photo-illustrated edition, published in 1994. This latter edition featured a [[42 Puzzle]] designed by Adams, which was later incorporated into paperback covers of the first four ''Hitchhiker's'' novels (the paperback for the fifth re-used the artwork from the hardback edition).<ref>[http://www.iblist.com/series.php?id=2 Internet Book List] page, with links to all five novels, and reproductions of the 1990s paperback covers that included the [[42 Puzzle]].</ref>

In 1980 Adams also began attempts to turn the first ''Hitchhiker's'' novel into a movie, making several trips to Los Angeles, and working with a number of Hollywood studios and potential producers. The next year, the radio series became the basis for a BBC television mini-series<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081874/|title=''The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy''|publisher=IMDB}}</ref> broadcast in six parts. When he died in 2001 in California, he had been trying again to get the movie project started with [[Disney]], which had bought the rights in 1998. The screenplay finally got a posthumous re-write by [[Karey Kirkpatrick]], and [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|the resulting movie]] was released in 2005.

Radio producer [[Dirk Maggs]] had consulted with Adams, first in 1993, and later in 1997 and 2000 about creating a third radio series, based on the third novel in the ''Hitchhiker's'' series.<ref>{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas. | editor = [[Dirk Maggs]], dramatisations and editor | title=The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Radio Scripts: The Tertiary, Quandary and Quintessential Phases | publisher=Pan Books | year=2005|isbn=0-330-43510-8 |pages=xiv | nopp=true}}</ref> They also discussed the possibilities of radio adaptations of the final two novels in the five-book "trilogy". As with the movie, this project was only realised after Adams's death. The third series, ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Tertiary Phase|The Tertiary Phase]]'', was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] in September 2004 and was subsequently released on audio CD. With the aid of a recording of his reading of ''Life, the Universe and Everything'' and editing, Adams can be heard playing the part of Agrajag posthumously. ''So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish'' and ''Mostly Harmless'' made up the fourth and fifth radio series, respectively (on radio they were titled ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quandary Phase|The Quandary Phase]]'' and ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quintessential Phase|The Quintessential Phase]]'') and these were broadcast in May and June 2005, and also subsequently released on Audio CD. The last episode in the last series (with a new, "more upbeat" ending) concluded with, "The very final episode of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' by Douglas Adams is affectionately dedicated to its author."<ref>Adams, ''Dirk Maggs,'' Page 356.</ref>

====''Dirk Gently'' series====
[[File:Douglas Adams San Francisco.jpg|thumb|Douglas Adams in March 2000]]
In between Adams's first trip to Madagascar with [[Mark Carwardine]] in 1985, and their series of travels that formed the basis for the radio series and non-fiction book ''[[Last Chance to See]]'', Adams wrote two other novels with a new cast of characters. ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'' was first published in 1987, and was described by its author as "a kind of ghost-horror-detective-time-travel-romantic-comedy-epic, mainly concerned with mud, music and quantum mechanics."<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Neil Gaiman|Gaiman, Neil]] | title=Don't Panic: Douglas Adams & The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy | edition=Second U.S. edition | publisher=Titan Books | year=2003 | page=169 | isbn=1-84023-742-2}}</ref>

A sequel novel, ''[[The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul]]'', was published a year later. This was an entirely original work, Adams's first since ''So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish.'' After the book tour, Adams set off on his round-the-world excursion which supplied him with the material for ''Last Chance to See''.

====''Doctor Who''====
{{Main|Doctor Who}}
Adams sent the script for the ''HHGG'' pilot radio programme to the ''Doctor Who'' production office in 1978, and was commissioned to write ''[[The Pirate Planet]]'' (see below). He had also previously attempted to submit a potential movie script, called "Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen," which later became his novel ''Life, the Universe and Everything'' (which in turn became the third ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' radio series). Adams then went on to serve as script editor on the show for its seventeenth season in 1979. Altogether, he wrote three [[List of Doctor Who serials|''Doctor Who'' serials]] starring [[Tom Baker]] as the Doctor:
* ''[[The Pirate Planet]]'' (the second serial in the "[[The Key to Time|Key To Time]]" arc, in [[List of Doctor Who serials#Season 16 (1978<U+2013>79)|Season 16]])
* ''[[City of Death]]'' (with producer [[Graham Williams]], from an original storyline by writer [[David Fisher (writer)|David Fisher]]. It was transmitted under the pseudonym "[[David Agnew]]")
* ''[[Shada]]'' (only partially filmed and not broadcast due to industrial disputes)

The episodes authored by Adams are some of the few that have not been novelised as Adams would not allow anyone else to write them, and asked for a higher price than the publishers were willing to pay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skepticfiles.org/en001/drwhogde.htm |title=A 1990s Doctor Who FAQ |publisher=Skepticfiles.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-11}}</ref>

Adams was also known to allow in-jokes from ''The Hitchhiker's Guide'' to appear in the ''Doctor Who'' stories he wrote and other stories on which he served as Script Editor. Subsequent writers have also inserted ''Hitchhiker's'' references, even [[42 (Doctor Who)|as recently as 2007]]. Conversely, at least one reference to ''Doctor Who'' was worked into a ''Hitchhiker's'' novel. In ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'', two characters travel in time and land on the pitch at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]]. The reaction of the radio commentators to their sudden appearance is very similar to the reactions of commentators in a scene in the eighth episode of the 1965<U+2013>66 story ''[[The Daleks' Master Plan]]'', which has [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor's]] [[TARDIS]] [[Materialization (science fiction)|materialise]] on the pitch at Lord's.

Elements of ''Shada'' and ''City of Death'' were reused in Adams's later novel ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'', in particular the character of [[Professor Chronotis]]. [[Big Finish Productions]] eventually remade ''Shada'' as an audio play starring [[Paul McGann]] as the Doctor. Accompanied by partially animated illustrations, it was [[Doctor Who spin-offs#Webcasts|webcast]] on the [[bbc.co.uk|BBC]] website in 2003, and subsequently released as a two-CD set later that year. An omnibus edition of this version was broadcast on the digital radio station [[BBC7]] on 10 December 2005.

Adams is credited with introducing a fan and later friend of his, the evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]], to Dawkins's future wife, [[Lalla Ward]], who had played the part of [[Romana]] in Doctor Who. Dawkins confirmed this in his eulogy of Adams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/documents/adams_index.html |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=Lament for Douglas |work=Edge |publisher=[[Edge Foundation, Inc.]] |date=17 September 2001 |accessdate=1 June 2009}}</ref>

When he was at school he wrote and performed a play called ''Doctor Which''.<ref name=Adams_xx>{{Harvnb|Adams|2002|pp=xx}}</ref>

===Music===
Adams played the guitar left-handed and had a collection of twenty-four left-handed guitars when he died (having received his first guitar in 1964). He also studied piano in the 1960s with the same teacher as [[Paul Wickens]], the pianist who plays in [[Paul McCartney]]'s band (and composed the music for the 2004<U+2013>2005 editions of the ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' radio series).<ref>Webb, page 49.</ref> [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Procol Harum]] had important influence on Adams's work.

====Pink Floyd====
Adams included a reference to [[Pink Floyd]] in the original radio version of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', in which he describes the main characters surveying the landscape of an alien planet while Marvin, their android companion, hums Pink Floyd's "[[Shine On You Crazy Diamond]]". This was cut out of the CD version. Adams also compared the various noises that the [[kakapo]] makes to "Pink Floyd studio out-takes" in his nonfiction book on endangered species, ''[[Last Chance to See]]''.

Adams's official biography shares its name with the song "[[Wish You Were Here (1975 song)|Wish You Were Here]]" by Pink Floyd. Adams was friends with Pink Floyd guitarist [[David Gilmour]] and, on Adams's 42nd birthday (the number 42 having special significance, being the [[Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything]] and also Adams's age when his daughter Polly was born), he was invited to make a guest appearance at Pink Floyd's 28 October 1994 concert at Earls Court in London, playing guitar on the songs "[[Brain Damage (song)|Brain Damage]]" and "[[Eclipse (song)|Eclipse]]". Adams chose the name for Pink Floyd's 1994 album, ''[[The Division Bell]]'', by picking the words from the lyrics to one of its tracks, "High Hopes". Gilmour also performed at Adams's memorial service in 2001, and what would have been Adams's 60th birthday party in 2012.

====Procol Harum====
Douglas Adams was a friend of [[Gary Brooker]], the lead singer, pianist and songwriter of [[Procol Harum]]. Adams invited Brooker to one of the many parties that Adams held at his house. On one such occasion Gary Brooker performed the full (4 verse) version of "[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]". Brooker also performed at Adams's memorial service.

Adams appeared on stage with Brooker to perform "In Held Twas in I" at Redhill when the band's lyricist [[Keith Reid]] was not available. On several other occasions he introduced Procol Harum at their gigs.

Adams would listen to music while writing, and this would occasionally influence his work. On one occasion the title track from the Procol Harum album ''[[Grand Hotel (album)|Grand Hotel]]'' was playing when
{{quotation|Suddenly in the middle of the song there was this huge orchestral climax that came out of nowhere and did not seem to be about anything. I kept wondering what was this huge thing happening in the background? And I eventually thought&nbsp;... it sounds as if there ought to be some sort of floorshow going on. Something huge and extraordinary, like, well, like the end of the universe. And so that was where the idea for The Restaurant at the End of the Universe came from.|Douglas Adams|Procol Harum at The Barbican<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.procolharum.com/dadams.htm |title=Text of one of Douglas Adams's introductions of Procol Harum in concert |accessdate=21 August 2006|last=Adams |first=Douglas |date=8 February 1996}}</ref>}}

===Computer games and projects===
Douglas Adams created an [[interactive fiction]] version of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|HHGG]]'' with [[Steve Meretzky]] from [[Infocom]] in 1984. In 1986 he participated in a week-long brainstorming session with the [[Lucasfilm Games]] team for the game ''[[Labyrinth: The Computer Game|Labyrinth]]''. Later he was also involved in creating ''[[Bureaucracy (computer game)|Bureaucracy]]'' (also by Infocom, but not based on any book; Adams wrote it as a parody of events in his own life). Adams was also responsible for the computer game ''[[Starship Titanic]]'', which was published in 1998 by [[Simon and Schuster]]. [[Terry Jones]] wrote the accompanying book, entitled ''Douglas Adams's Starship Titanic'', since Adams was too busy with the computer game to do both. In April 1999, Adams initiated the [[h2g2]] [[collaborative writing]] project, an experimental attempt at making ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' a reality, and at harnessing the collective brainpower of the internet community.

In 1990 Adams wrote and presented a television documentary programme ''[[Hyperland]]''<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0188677/ Internet Movie Database's page for ''Hyperland'']</ref> which featured [[Tom Baker]] as a "software agent" (similar to the assistant pictured in Apples Knowledge Navigator video of future concepts from 1987), and interviews with [[Ted Nelson]], the co-inventor of [[hypertext]] and the person who coined the term. Although Adams did not invent hypertext, he was an [[early adopter]] and advocate of it. This was the same year that [[Tim Berners-Lee]] used the idea of hypertext in his [[HTML]].

==Personal beliefs and activism==
===Atheism and views on religion===
Adams described himself as a "radical [[atheist]]", adding ''radical'' for emphasis so he would not be asked if he meant [[agnostic]]. He told [[American Atheists]] that this made things easier, but most importantly it conveyed the fact that he really meant it. "I am convinced that there is not a god," he said. Despite this, he remained fascinated by religion because of its effect on human affairs. "I love to keep poking and prodding at it. I've thought about it so much over the years that that fascination is bound to spill over into my writing."<ref name=amath>{{cite journal|last=Silverman|first=Dave|title=Interview: Douglas Adams|journal=American Atheist|year=1998-1999|volume=37|issue=1|url=http://www.atheists.org/Interview%3A__Douglas_Adams|accessdate=16 August 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/63mRFcWVO|archivedate=8 December 2011|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The evolutionary biologist and atheist [[Richard Dawkins]] in ''[[The God Delusion]]'' uses Adams' influence throughout to exemplify arguments for non-belief; Dawkins jokingly states that Adams is "possibly [my] only convert" to atheism.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/roundupstory/0,,1939704,00.html |title=Observer, '&#39;The God Delusion'&#39;, 5&nbsp;November 2006 |publisher=Books.guardian.co.uk |date=5 November 2006 |accessdate=1 June 2009 | location=London | first=Kim | last=Bunce}}</ref> The book is dedicated to Adams, quoting a character from ''The Hitchhiker's Guide'', "Isn't it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too?"

===Environmental activism===
Adams was also an [[environmental activist]] who campaigned on behalf of [[endangered species]]. This activism included the production of the non-fiction radio series ''[[Last Chance to See]]'', in which he and [[natural history|naturalist]] [[Mark Carwardine]] visited rare species such as the [[Kakapo]] and [[Chinese River Dolphin|Baiji]], and the publication of a tie-in book of the same name. In 1992 this was made into a CD-ROM combination of [[audio book]], [[e-book]] and picture slide show.

Adams and Mark Carwardine contributed the 'Meeting a Gorilla' passage from ''[[Last Chance to See]]'' to the book ''[[Great Ape Project|The Great Ape Project]]''.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Paola Cavalieri|Cavalieri, Paola]] and [[Peter Singer]], editors | title=The Great Ape Project: Equality Beyond Humanity | edition=U.S. Paperback | publisher=St. Martin's Griffin | year=1994 | pages=19<U+2013>23|isbn=0-312-11818-X}}</ref> This book, edited by [[Paola Cavalieri]] and [[Peter Singer]] launched a wider-scale project in 1993, which calls for the extension of moral equality to include all great apes, human and non-human.

In 1994 he participated in a climb of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] while wearing a rhino suit for the British charity organisation ''[[Save the Rhino International]]''. Puppeteer William Todd-Jones, who had originally worn the suit in the London marathon to raise money and bring awareness to the group Save the Rhino International, also participated in the same climb while in the suit; Adams wore the suit while travelling to the mountain before the climb proper began. About <U+00A3>100,000 were raised through that event, benefiting schools in [[Kenya]] and a [[Black Rhinoceros]] preservation programme in [[Tanzania]]. Adams was also an active supporter of the ''[[Dian Fossey]] Gorilla Fund''. 

In 1998, Adams published an essay bemoaning the wasteful profusion and confusion of power adapters, and calling for more standardization.<ref name=DouglasAdams>{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Douglas|title=Dongly things|url=http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/980707-03-a.html|work=douglasadams.com|publisher=The Digital Village, Ltd.|accessdate=3 June 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110611092241/http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/980707-03-a.html| archivedate= 11 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In 2009, the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) announced support of the [[Open Mobile Terminal Platform]]'s (OMTP) "Common Charging and Local Data Connectivity" standard which specifies the use of micro-USB receptacles on mobile phones and standard USB receptacles on (common / interchangeable) chargers.<ref>OMTP: Common Charging and Local Data Connectivity ([http://www.gsmworld.com/documents/OMTP_CCLDC_v1_1_Final.pdf link]), 11 February 2009</ref>  The hope is to markedly reduce the profusion of non-interchangeable power adapters needed for each year's new output of mobile phone models.

Since 2003, ''Save the Rhino'' has held an annual Douglas Adams Memorial Lecture around the time of his birthday to raise money for environmental campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.savetherhino.org/eTargetSRINM/site/1190/default.aspx |title=The Ninth Douglas Adams Memorial Lecture |publisher=Save the Rhino International |date= |accessdate=27 July 2011}}{{dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref> The lectures in the series are:

===Technology and innovation===
Though he did not buy his first [[word processor]] until 1982, he had considered one as early as 1979. He was quoted as saying that until 1982, he had difficulties with "the impenetrable barrier of jargon. Words were flying backwards and forwards without concepts riding on their backs." In 1982 his first purchase was a 'Nexus'. In 1983, when he and Jane Belson went out to Los Angeles, he bought a [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Rainbow 100|Rainbow]]. Upon their return to England, Adams bought an [[Apricot Computers|Apricot]], then a [[BBC Micro]] and a [[Tandy 1000]].<ref name=Simpson_184-185>{{Harvnb|Simpson|2003|pp=184-185}}</ref> In ''[[Last Chance to See]]'' Adams mentions his [[Cambridge Z88]], which he had taken to [[Zaire]] on a quest to find the [[Northern White Rhinoceros]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Adams, Douglas and [[Mark Carwardine]] | title=Last Chance to See | edition=First U.S. Hardcover | publisher=[[Harmony Books]] | year=1991 | page=59 | isbn=0-517-58215-5}}</ref>

Adams's posthumously published work, ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'', features multiple articles by him on the subject of technology, including reprints of articles that originally ran in ''[[MacUser]]'' magazine, and in ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'' newspaper. In these Adams claims that one of the first computers he ever saw was a [[Commodore PET]], and that he has "adored" his Apple Macintosh ("or rather my family of however many Macintoshes it is that I've recklessly accumulated over the years") since he first saw one at Infocom's offices in Boston in 1983.<ref>{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas | title=The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time | edition=First UK hardcover edition | publisher=Macmillan | year=2002 | pages=90<U+2013>1 | isbn=0-333-76657-1}}</ref>

Adams was a Macintosh user from the time they first came out in 1984 until his death in 2001. He was the first person to buy a Mac in Europe (the second being [[Stephen Fry]] <U+2013> though some accounts differ on this, saying Fry bought his Mac first. Fry claims he was second to Adams.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CHAryVVXSo&feature=player_embedded#at=74 |title=<U+202A>Craig Ferguson 23 February, 2010B Late Late show Stephen Fry PT2<U+202C><U+200F> |publisher=YouTube |date=21 June 2010 |accessdate=27 July 2011}}</ref>) Adams was also an "[[AppleMasters|Apple Master]]", one of several celebrities whom Apple made into spokespeople for its products (other Apple Masters included [[John Cleese]] and [[Gregory Hines]]). Adams's contributions included a rock video that he created using the first version of [[iMovie]] with footage featuring his daughter Polly. The video was available on Adams's [[.Mac]] homepage. Adams installed and started using the first release of [[Mac OS X]] in the weeks leading up to his death. His very last post to his own forum was in praise of Mac OS X and the possibilities of its [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] programming framework. He said it was ''"awesome..."'', which was also the last word he wrote on his site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.douglasadams.com/cgi-bin/mboard/info/dnathread.cgi?2922,1 |title=Adams's final post on his forums at |publisher=Douglasadams.com |date= |accessdate=1 June 2009}}</ref> Adams can also be seen in the ''[[Omnibus (TV series)|Omnibus]]'' tribute included with the Region One/NTSC DVD release of the TV adaptation of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide'' using Mac OS X on his [[PowerBook G3]].

Adams used e-mail extensively long before it reached popular awareness, using it to correspond with [[Steve Meretzky]] during the pair's collaboration on Infocom's version of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''.<ref name=Simpson_184-185>{{Harvnb|Simpson|2003|pp=184-185}}</ref>  While living in New Mexico in 1993 he set up another e-mail address and began posting to his own [[USENET]] newsgroup, alt.fan.douglas-adams, and occasionally, when his computer was acting up, to the comp.sys.mac hierarchy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/alt.fan.douglas-adams |title=Discussions - alt.fan.douglas-adams &#124; Google Groups |publisher=Groups.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-11}}</ref> Many of his posts are now archived through Google. Challenges to the authenticity of his messages later led Adams to set up a message forum on his own website to avoid the issue.
Adams was also a keynote speaker for the April 2001 [[Embedded Systems Conference#ESC Silicon Valley|Embedded Systems Conference]] in San Francisco, one of the major technical conferences on [[embedded system]] engineering. In his keynote speech, he shared his vision of technology and how it should contribute in everyday <U+2013> and every man's <U+2013> life.<ref>{{cite web |last = Cassel |first = David |title = So long, Douglas Adams, and thanks for all the fun |work=[[Salon.com]] |publisher=Salon Media Group |date = 15 May 2001 |url = http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2001/05/15/douglas_adams/index.html |accessdate =10 July 2009}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Adams moved to Upper Street, Islington, in 1981<ref name="IPP" /> and to Duncan Terrace in Islington in the late 1980s.<ref name="IPP" />

In the early 1980s Adams had an affair with novelist [[Sally Emerson]], who was separated from her husband at that time. Adams later dedicated his book ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'' to Emerson. In 1981 Emerson returned to her husband, [[Peter Stothard]], a contemporary of Adams's at [[Brentwood School (England)|Brentwood School]], and later editor of ''[[The Times]]''. Adams was soon introduced by friends to Jane Belson, with whom he later became romantically involved. Belson was the "lady barrister" mentioned in the jacket-flap biography printed in his books during the mid-1980s ("He [Adams] lives in Islington with a lady barrister and an Apple Macintosh"). The two lived in Los Angeles together during 1983 while Adams worked on an early screenplay adaptation of ''Hitchhiker's''. When the deal fell through, they moved to London, and after several separations ("He is currently not certain where he lives, or with whom")<ref name=sfweekly>{{cite web|last=Bowers|first=Keith|title=Big Three|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2011-07-06/calendar/big-three/|work=SF Weekly|publisher=SF Weekly|accessdate=8 December 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/63mSWp8yr|archivedate=8 December 2011|deadurl=no|date=06|month=07|year=2011}}</ref> and an aborted engagement, they married on 25 November 1991. Adams and Belson had one daughter together, Polly Jane Rocket Adams, born on 22 June 1994, shortly after Adams turned 42. In 1999 the family moved from London to [[Santa Barbara, California]], where they lived until his death. Following the funeral, Jane Belson and Polly Adams returned to London.<ref>Webb, Chapter 10.</ref> Jane died on 7 September 2011.<ref name=timesobit>{{cite web|title=Obituary & Guest Book Preview for Jane Elizabeth BELSON|url=http://announcements.thetimes.co.uk/obituaries/timesonline-uk/obituary.aspx?page=lifestory&pid=153521790|work=The Times|publisher=The Times|accessdate=8 December 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/63mSoMnJe|archivedate=8 December 2011|deadurl=no|date=09|month=09|year=2011}}</ref>

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Douglas Adams' gravestone.jpg|thumb|upright|Douglas Adams's gravestone, [[Highgate Cemetery]], North London]]
Adams died of a heart attack on 11 May 2001, aged  49, after resting from his regular workout at a private gym in [[Montecito, California]]. He had unknowingly suffered a gradual narrowing of the [[coronary arteries]], which led at that moment to a [[myocardial infarction]] and a fatal [[cardiac arrhythmia]]. Adams had been due to deliver the commencement address at [[Harvey Mudd College]] on 13 May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2001-05-24/news/lots-of-screamingly-funny-sentences-no-fish/ |title=Lots of Screamingly Funny Sentences.

His remains were subsequently cremated and the ashes placed in [[Highgate Cemetery]] in north London in June 2002.<ref name=Simpson_337-338>{{Harvnb|Simpson|2003|pp=337-338}}</ref>

A memorial service was held on 17 September 2001 at [[St. Martin-in-the-Fields]] church, [[Trafalgar Square]], London. This became the first church service broadcast live on the web by the BBC.<ref>Gaiman, 204.</ref> Video clips of the service are still available on the BBC's website for download.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/celebration/ |title=BBC Online - Cult - Hitchhiker's - Douglas Adams - Service of Celebration |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2001-09-17 |accessdate=2013-03-11}}</ref>

One of his last public appearances was a talk given at the University of California, Santa Barbara, ''Parrots, the universe and everything'', recorded days before his death.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZG8HBuDjgc |title=Parrots, the universe and everything, recorded May 2001 |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-11}}</ref> A full transcript of the talk is also available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://navarroj.com/parrots |title=Transcript of "Parrots, the Universe and Everything" |publisher=Navarroj.com |date= |accessdate=27 July 2011}}</ref>

In May 2002 ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'' was published, containing many short stories, essays, and letters, as well as eulogies from [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Stephen Fry]] (in the UK edition), [[Christopher Cerf]] (in the U.S. edition), and [[Terry Jones]] (in the U.S. paperback edition). It also includes eleven chapters of his long-awaited but unfinished novel, ''The Salmon of Doubt'', which was originally intended to become a new [[Dirk Gently]] novel, but might have later become the sixth ''Hitchhiker'' novel.<ref>

Other events after Adams's death included a [[webcast]] production of ''[[Shada]]'', allowing the complete story to be told, radio dramatisations of the final three books in the ''Hitchhiker's'' series, and the completion of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|the film adaptation]] of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. The film, released in 2005, posthumously credits Adams as a producer, and several art design elements <U+2013> most notably a head-shaped planet seen near the end of the film <U+2013> incorporated Adams's features.

A 12-part radio series based on the [[Dirk Gently]] novels was announced in 2007, with annual transmissions starting in October.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dirkmaggs.dswilliams.co.uk/Dirk%20Maggs%20News%20%20new%20projects.htm |title=Dirk Maggs News and New Projects page |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080427143055/www.dirkmaggs.dswilliams.co.uk/Dirk+Maggs+News++new+projects.htm |archivedate=9 February 2008 }}</ref>

BBC Radio 4 also commissioned a third Dirk Gently radio series based on the incomplete chapters of ''The Salmon of Doubt'', and written by [[Kim Fuller]];<ref>{{cite web|author=Matthew Hemley |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/24312/douglas-adams-final-dirk-gently-novel-to-be |title=[[The Stage]] / News / Douglas Adams's final Dirk Gently novel to be adapted for Radio 4 |publisher=Thestage.co.uk |date=5 May 2009 |accessdate=20 August 2009}}</ref> however, this has now been dropped in favour of a BBC TV series based on the two completed novels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2009/10/11/9767/bbc_plans_dirk_gently_tv_series|title=BBC plans Dirk Gently TV series|publisher=Chortle.co.uk|date=11 October 2009|accessdate=11 October 2009}}</ref> A sixth ''Hitchhiker'' novel, ''[[And Another Thing...

A [[BBC Radio 4]] ''[[Book at Bedtime]]'' adaptation and an audio book soon followed.

In 2011, over 3000 people took part in a public vote to choose the subjects of [[Blue plaque|People's Plaques]] in Islington.<ref name="IPP">{{cite web|url=http://www.islington.gov.uk/Leisure/heritage/heritage_borough/bor_plaques/peoplesplaques.asp|title=Islington People's Plaques|date=25 July 2011|accessdate=13 August 2011}}{{dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref> Adams received 489 votes, and a plaque is due to be erected in his honour.<ref name="IPP" /> On 11 March 2013, Adams' 61st birthday was celebrated with a Google Doodle.<ref name=GoogleDoodle2013a>{{cite news|title=Don<U+2019>t Panic!
