'''John Sidney McCain III''' (born August 29, 1936)<!-- DON'T WIKILINK DATE.  SEE NOTE ABOVE. --> is the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|senior]] [[United States]] [[United States Senator|Senator]] from [[Arizona]]. He was the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[presidential nominee|nominee for president]] in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 United States election]].

McCain followed [[John S. McCain, Jr.|his father]] and [[John S. McCain, Sr.|grandfather]], both [[4 star rank|four-star]] [[Admiral (United States)|admirals]], into the [[United States Navy]], graduating from the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]] in 1958. He became a [[naval aviator]], flying [[ground-attack aircraft]] from [[aircraft carriers]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], he nearly lost his life in the [[1967 USS Forrestal fire|1967 USS ''Forrestal'' fire]]. In October 1967, while on a bombing mission over [[Hanoi]], he was shot down, seriously injured, and captured by the [[North Vietnam]]ese. He was a [[prisoner of war]] until 1973.  McCain experienced episodes of [[torture]], and refused an out-of-sequence early [[repatriation]] offer. His war wounds left him with lifelong physical limitations.

He retired from the Navy as a [[Captain (U.S. Navy)|captain]] in 1981 and moved to Arizona, where he entered politics. Elected to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in 1982, he served two terms, and was then elected to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in 1986, winning re-election easily four times, most recently in 2010. While generally adhering to [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] principles, McCain at times has had a media reputation as a "[[wiktionary:maverick|maverick]]" for his willingness to disagree with his party on certain issues. After being investigated and largely exonerated in a political influence scandal of the 1980s as a member of the [[Keating Five]], he made [[campaign finance reform]] one of his signature concerns, which eventually led to the passage of the [[McCain-Feingold Act]] in 2002. He is also known for his work towards restoring diplomatic relations with [[Vietnam]] in the 1990s, and for his belief that the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]] should be fought to a successful conclusion. McCain has chaired the [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Senate Commerce Committee]], has opposed spending that he considered to be [[pork barrel]], and played a key role in [[Gang of 14|alleviating a crisis over judicial nominations]].

McCain ran for the Republican presidential nomination in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] but lost [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2000|a heated primary contest]] to [[George W. Bush]].  He secured the nomination in [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]] after coming back from early reversals, but lost to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[Barack Obama]] in the general election.
