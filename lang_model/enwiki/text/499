'''George VI''' (Albert Frederick Arthur George; 14 December 1895 <U+2013> 6 February 1952) was [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|King of the United Kingdom]] and the [[Dominion]]s of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] from 11 December 1936 until his death. He was the last [[Emperor of India]] and the first [[Head of the Commonwealth]].

As the second son of [[George V|King George V]], he was not expected to inherit the throne and spent his early life in the shadow of his elder brother, [[Edward VIII|Edward]]. He served in the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force]] during the [[World War I|First World War]], and after it took on the usual round of public engagements. He married [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]] in 1923 and they had two daughters, [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]].

George's elder brother ascended the throne as Edward VIII upon the death of their father in 1936. However, later that year Edward revealed his desire to marry the divorced American socialite [[Wallis Simpson]]. British Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] advised Edward that for political and religious reasons he could not marry a divorced woman and remain king. [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|Edward abdicated]] in order to marry, and George ascended the throne as the third monarch of the [[House of Windsor]].

During George's reign the break-up of the [[British Empire]] and its transition into the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] accelerated. The parliament of the [[Irish Free State]] [[Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936|removed]] direct mention of the monarch from [[Constitution of the Irish Free State|the country's constitution]] on the day of his accession. Within three years, the Empire and Commonwealth, except the Irish Free State, was at [[World War II|war]] with [[Nazi Germany]]. In the next two years, war with [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Italy]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] followed. Though [[Allies of World War II|Britain and its allies]] were ultimately victorious, the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] rose as pre-eminent [[superpower|world powers]] and the British Empire declined. After the [[Indian Independence Act 1947|independence of India and Pakistan]] in 1947, George remained as king of both countries, but the title ''Emperor of India'' was abandoned in June 1948. Ireland [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|formally declared itself a republic]] and left the Commonwealth in 1949, and India became a republic within the Commonwealth the following year. George adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth. He was beset by health problems in the later years of his reign. His elder daughter, Elizabeth, succeeded him.

== Early life ==
[[File:Edward VII UK and successors.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Four kings: Edward VII (far right), his son George, Prince of Wales, later George V (far left), and grandsons Edward, later Edward VIII (rear), and Albert, later George VI (foreground), c. 1908]]
George VI was born at [[York Cottage]], on the [[Sandringham House|Sandringham Estate]] in Norfolk, during the reign of his great-grandmother [[Queen Victoria]].<ref>Rhodes James, p. 90; Weir, p. 329</ref> His father was Prince George, [[Duke of York]] (later [[George V|King George V]]), the second and eldest-surviving son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]]). His mother was the Duchess of York (later [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]), the eldest child and only daughter of [[Francis, Duke of Teck|the Duke]] and [[Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge|Duchess of Teck]].<ref>Weir, pp. 322<U+2013>323, 329</ref>

His birthday (14 December 1895) was the anniversary of the death of his great-grandfather, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert, the Prince Consort]].<ref>Judd, p. 3; Rhodes James, p. 90; Townsend, p. 15; Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 7<U+2013>8</ref> Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been "rather distressed". Two days later, he wrote again: "I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name ''Albert'' to her".<ref>Judd, pp. 4<U+2013>5; Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 7<U+2013>8</ref> Queen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: "I am all impatience to see the ''new'' one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good".<ref>Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 7<U+2013>8</ref> Consequently, he was [[baptism|baptised]] "Albert Frederick Arthur George" at [[St. Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham|St. Mary Magdalene's Church]] near Sandringham three months later.{{ref|baptism|a}} As a great-grandson of Queen Victoria, he was known formally as "His Highness Prince Albert of York" from birth. Within the family, he was known informally as "Bertie".<ref>Judd, p. 6; Rhodes James, p. 90; Townsend, p. 15; Windsor, p. 9</ref> His maternal grandmother, the Duchess of Teck, did not like the first name the baby had been given, and she wrote prophetically that she hoped the last name "may supplant the less favoured one".<ref>Bradford, p. 2</ref>

Albert, as he was known, was fourth in line to the throne at birth, after his grandfather, father and elder brother, [[Edward VIII|Edward]]. In 1898, Queen Victoria issued [[letters patent|Letters Patent]] that granted the children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales the [[Style (manner of address)|style]] ''[[Royal Highness]]'', and at the age of two, Albert became "His Royal Highness Prince Albert of York".

He often suffered from ill health and was described as "easily frightened and somewhat prone to tears".<ref>Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 17<U+2013>18</ref> His parents were generally removed from their children's day-to-day upbringing, as was the norm in aristocratic families of that era. He had a [[stutter|stammer]] that lasted for many years, and was forced to write with his right hand although he was naturally [[Left-handedness|left-handed]]. He suffered from chronic stomach problems as well as [[genu valgum|knock knees]], for which he was forced to wear painful corrective splints.<ref name="matthew">{{citation|first=H. C. G.|last=Matthew|authorlink=Colin Matthew|title=George VI (1895<U+2013>1952)|journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004}}</ref>

Queen Victoria died on 22 January 1901, and the Prince of Wales succeeded her as King Edward VII. Prince Albert moved up to third-in-line to the throne, after his father and elder brother.

==Military career and education==
From 1909, Albert attended the [[Osborne House|Royal Naval College, Osborne]], as a naval [[cadet]]. In 1911, he came bottom of the class in the final examination, but despite this he progressed to the [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Royal Naval College, Dartmouth]].<ref>Bradford, pp. 41<U+2013>45; Judd, pp. 21<U+2013>24; Rhodes James, p. 91</ref> When Edward VII died in 1910, Albert's father became King George V. Prince Edward was created Prince of Wales, and Albert was second in line to the throne.<ref>Judd, pp. 22<U+2013>23</ref>

Albert spent the first six months of 1913 on the training ship {{HMS|Cumberland|1902|6}} in the [[West Indies]] and on the east coast of Canada.<ref>Judd, p. 26</ref> He was rated as a [[midshipman]] aboard {{HMS|Collingwood|1908|6}} on 15 September 1913, and spent three months in the [[Mediterranean]]. His fellow officers gave him the nickname "Mr. Johnson".<ref>Judd, p. 28</ref> One year after his commission, he began service in the First World War. He was [[mentioned in despatches]] for his action as a turret officer aboard ''Collingwood'' in the [[Battle of Jutland]] (31 May <U+2013> 1 June 1916), an indecisive engagement with the [[German Empire|German]] [[Imperial German Navy|navy]] that was the largest naval action of the war. He did not see further combat, largely because of ill health caused by a [[peptic ulcer|duodenal ulcer]], for which he had an operation in November 1917.<ref name=Bradford55>Bradford, pp. 55<U+2013>76</ref> In February 1918, he was appointed Officer in Charge of Boys at the [[Royal Naval Air Service]]'s training establishment at [[RAF Cranwell|Cranwell]].<ref name="cranwell">{{citation |url= http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafcollegecranwell/history/transitionyears.cfm |title=RAF College Cranwell <U+2013> Transition Years |publisher=Royal Air Force|accessdate=5 March 2013}}</ref> With the establishment of the [[Royal Air Force]] two months later and the transfer of Cranwell from Navy to Air Force control, he transferred from the Royal Navy to the Royal Air Force.<ref name=Bradford55/> He was appointed Officer Commanding Number 4 Squadron of the Boys' Wing at Cranwell and he remained there until August 1918.<ref name="cranwell"/> He was the first member of the royal family to be certified as a fully qualified pilot.<ref>Judd, p. 45; Rhodes James, p. 91</ref> During the closing weeks of the war, he served on the staff of the RAF's [[Independent Air Force]] at its headquarters in [[Nancy, France]].<ref>{{citation |last=Boyle |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Boyle |title=Trenchard Man of Vision |year=1962 |publisher=Collins |location= St. James's Place London |page=360|chapter=Chapter 13}}</ref> Following the disbanding of the Independent Air Force in November 1918, he remained on the Continent for two months as a staff officer with the Royal Air Force until posted back to Britain.<ref>Judd, p. 44</ref>

In October 1919, Albert went up to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he studied history, economics and civics for a year.<ref>Judd, p. 47; Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 128<U+2013>131</ref> On 4 June 1920, he was created [[Duke of York]], [[Earl of Inverness]] and [[Baron Killarney]].<ref>Weir, p. 329</ref> He began to take on more royal duties. He represented his father, and toured coal mines, factories, and railyards. Through such visits he acquired the nickname of the "Industrial Prince".<ref>''Current Biography 1942'', p. 280; Judd, p. 72; Townsend, p. 59</ref> His stammer, and his embarrassment over it, together with his tendency to shyness, caused him to appear much less impressive than his older brother, Edward. However, he was physically active and enjoyed playing tennis. He played at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] in the Men's Doubles with [[Louis Greig]] in 1926.<ref>Judd, p. 52</ref> He developed an interest in working conditions, and was President of the [[The Work Foundation|Industrial Welfare Society]]. His series of annual summer camps for boys between 1921 and 1939 brought together boys from different social backgrounds.<ref>Judd, pp. 77<U+2013>86; Rhodes James, p. 97</ref>

== Marriage ==
{{see also|Wedding of Prince Albert, Duke of York, and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon}}
In a time when royals were expected to marry fellow royals, it was unusual that Albert had a great deal of freedom in choosing a prospective wife. In 1920, he met for the first time since childhood Lady [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]], the youngest daughter of [[Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|the Earl]] and [[Cecilia Bowes-Lyon, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne]]. He became determined to marry her.<ref>Rhodes James, pp. 94<U+2013>96; Vickers, pp. 31, 44</ref> She rejected his proposal twice, in 1921 and 1922, reportedly because she was reluctant to make the sacrifices necessary to become a member of the royal family.<ref>Bradford, p. 106</ref> In the words of Lady Elizabeth's mother, Albert would be "made or marred" by his choice of wife. After a protracted courtship, Elizabeth agreed to marry him.<ref>Bradford, p. 77; Judd, pp. 57<U+2013>59</ref>

They were married on 26 April 1923 in [[Westminster Abbey]]. Albert's marriage to someone not of royal birth was considered a modernising gesture.<ref>{{citation | last=Roberts |first=Andrew |coauthors=Edited by [[Antonia Fraser]] |title=The House of Windsor|publisher=Cassell & Co. |location=London |year=2000 |isbn=0-304-35406-6 |pages=57<U+2013>58}}</ref> The newly formed [[British Broadcasting Company]] wished to record and broadcast the event on radio, but the Abbey [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]] vetoed the idea (although the [[List of Deans of Westminster|Dean]], [[Herbert Edward Ryle]], was in favour).<ref>{{citation |last=Reith |first=John |authorlink=John Reith, 1st Baron Reith |title=Into the Wind |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton |location=London |year=1949 |page=94}}</ref> Lady Elizabeth was styled "Her Royal Highness The Duchess of York" after their marriage.

From December 1924 to April 1925, the Duke and Duchess toured [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]], [[Uganda Protectorate|Uganda]], and the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]], travelling via the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Aden]]. During the trip, they both went [[big game hunting]].<ref>Judd, pp. 89<U+2013>93</ref>

Because of his stammer, Albert dreaded public speaking.<ref>Judd, p. 49</ref> After his closing speech at the [[British Empire Exhibition]] at [[Wembley]] on 31 October 1925, one which was an ordeal for both him and his listeners,<ref>Judd, pp. 93<U+2013>97; Rhodes James, p. 97</ref> he began to see [[Lionel Logue]], an Australian-born speech therapist. The Duke and Logue practised breathing exercises, and the Duchess rehearsed with him patiently.<ref>Judd, p. 98; Rhodes James, p. 98</ref> Subsequently, he was able to speak with less hesitation.<ref>''Current Biography 1942'', pp. 294<U+2013>295; Judd, p. 99</ref> With his delivery improved, the Duke opened the new [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] in [[Canberra]], Australia, during a tour of the empire in 1927.<ref>Judd, p. 106; Rhodes James, p. 99</ref> His journey by sea to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji took him via Jamaica, where Albert played doubles tennis partnered with a black man, which was unusual at the time and taken locally as a display of equality between races.<ref>Shawcross, p. 273</ref>

The Duke and Duchess of York had two children: [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] (called "Lilibet" by the family), and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]]. The Duke and Duchess and their two daughters lived a relatively sheltered life at their London residence, 145 [[Piccadilly]]. They were a close and loving family.<ref>Judd, pp. 111, 225, 231</ref> One of the few stirs arose when the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]], [[R. B. Bennett]], considered the Duke for [[Governor General of Canada]] in 1931<U+2014>a proposal that King George V rejected on the advice of the [[Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs]], [[J. H. Thomas]].<ref>Howarth, p. 53</ref>

== Reluctant king ==

{{Main|Edward VIII abdication crisis}}
King George V had severe reservations about Prince Edward, saying, "I pray God that my eldest son will never marry and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne."<ref>Ziegler, p. 199</ref> On 20 January 1936, George V died and Edward ascended the throne as Edward VIII. In the [[Vigil of the Princes]], Prince Albert and his three brothers took a shift standing guard over their father's body as it [[Lying in state|lay in state]], in a closed casket, in [[Palace of Westminster#Westminster Hall|Westminster Hall]].

As Edward was unmarried and had no children, Albert was the [[heir presumptive]] to the throne. Less than a year later, on 11 December 1936, Edward VIII [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]] in order to marry his mistress, [[Wallis Simpson]], who was divorced from her first husband and divorcing her second. Edward had been advised by British Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] that he could not remain king and marry a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands. Edward chose abdication in preference to abandoning his marriage plans. Thus Albert became king, a position he was reluctant to accept.<ref>Judd, p. 140</ref> The day before the abdication, he went to London to see his mother, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]. He wrote in his diary, "When I told her what had happened, I broke down and sobbed like a child."<ref>Wheeler-Bennett, p. 286</ref>

On the day of the abdication, the [[Oireachtas]], the parliament of the [[Irish Free State]] [[Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936|removed all direct mention of the monarch]] from the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State|Irish constitution]]. The next day, it passed the [[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936|External Relations Act]], which made provision for the monarch to act as the state's representative in foreign affairs. The two acts made the Irish Free State a republic in essence without removing its links to the Commonwealth.<ref>Townsend, p. 93</ref>

Courtier and journalist Dermot Morrah alleged that there was brief speculation as to the desirability of bypassing Albert (and his children) and his brother, [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]], in favour of their younger brother [[Prince George, Duke of Kent]]. This seems to have been suggested on the grounds that Prince George was at that time the only brother with [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|a son]].<ref>Howarth, p. 63; Judd, p. 135</ref>

== Early reign ==
[[File:Darlington God save the king..JPG|thumb|left|alt=Three-storey Victorian building festooned with garlands with the words "God Save the King" mounted on the pitched roof|[[Darlington]] Town Hall decorated for the Coronation, 1937]]
Albert assumed the [[regnal name]] "George VI" to emphasise continuity with his father and restore confidence in the monarchy.<ref>Howarth, p. 66; Judd, p. 141</ref> The beginning of George VI's reign was taken up by questions surrounding his predecessor and brother, whose titles, style and position were uncertain. He had been introduced as "His Royal Highness Prince Edward" for the abdication broadcast,<ref>Judd, p. 144; Sinclair, p. 224</ref> but George VI felt that by abdicating and renouncing the succession Edward had lost the right to bear royal titles, including "Royal Highness".<ref>Howarth, p. 143</ref> In settling the issue, George's first act as king was to confer upon his brother the title and style "His Royal Highness The [[Duke of Windsor]]", but the [[letters patent|Letters Patent]] creating the dukedom prevented any wife or children from bearing royal styles. George VI was also forced to buy from Edward the royal residences of [[Balmoral Castle]] and [[Sandringham House]], as these were private properties and did not pass to George VI automatically.<ref>Ziegler, p. 326</ref> Three days after his accession, on his 41st birthday, he invested his wife, the new [[queen consort]], with the [[Order of the Garter]].<ref>Bradford, p. 223</ref>

[[Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth|George VI's coronation]] took place on 12 May 1937, the date previously intended for Edward's coronation. In a break with tradition, Queen Mary attended the ceremony in a show of support for her son.<ref>Bradford, p. 214</ref> There was no [[durbar (court)|Durbar]] held in [[Delhi]] for George VI, as had occurred for his father, as the cost would have been a burden to the [[British Raj|government of India]].<ref>Vickers, p. 175</ref> Rising [[Indian independence movement|Indian nationalism]] made the welcome that the royal couple would have received likely to be muted at best,<ref>Bradford, p. 209</ref> and a prolonged absence from Britain would have been undesirable in the tense period before the Second World War. Two overseas tours were undertaken, to France and to North America, both of which promised greater strategic advantages in the event of war.<ref>Bradford, pp. 269, 281</ref>

The growing likelihood of war in Europe dominated the early reign of George VI. The King was constitutionally bound to support Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s [[appeasement of Hitler]].<ref name="matthew"/><ref>Sinclair, p. 230</ref> However, when the King and Queen greeted Chamberlain on his return from negotiating the [[Munich Agreement]] in 1938, they invited him to appear on the balcony of [[Buckingham Palace]] with them. This public association of the monarchy with a politician was exceptional, as balcony appearances were traditionally restricted to the royal family.<ref name="matthew" /> While broadly popular among the general public, Chamberlain's policy towards Hitler was the subject of some opposition in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], which led historian [[John Grigg (writer)|John Grigg]] to describe the King's behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as "the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century".<ref>[[Christopher Hitchens|Hitchens, Christopher]] (1 April 2002), [http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2002/apr/01/queenmother.monarchy9 "Mourning will be brief"], ''The Guardian'', retrieved 1 May 2009</ref>

In May and June 1939, the [[1939 royal tour of Canada|King and Queen toured Canada]] and the United States. From [[Ottawa]], the royal couple were accompanied throughout by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]],<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/king/023011-1070.06-e.html| last=Library and Archives Canada| authorlink=Library and Archives Canada| title=Biography and People > A Real Companion and Friend > Behind the Diary > Politics, Themes, and Events from King's Life > The Royal Tour of 1939| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=12 December 2009}}</ref> to present themselves in North America as [[Monarchy of Canada|King and Queen of Canada]].<ref>{{citation| last=Bousfield| first=Arthur| coauthors=Toffoli, Garry| title=Royal Spring: The Royal Tour of 1939 and the Queen Mother in Canada| publisher=Dundurn Press| year=1989| location=Toronto| pages=60, 66| url=http://books.google.com/?id=1Go5p_CN8UQC&printsec=frontcover&q=| isbn=1-55002-065-X}}</ref><ref>{{citation| last=Lanctot| first=Gustave| authorlink=Gustave Lanctot| title=Royal Tour of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in Canada and the United States of America 1939| publisher=E.P.

Both [[Governor General of Canada]] [[John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir|Lord Tweedsmuir]] and Mackenzie King hoped that the King's presence in Canada would demonstrate the principles of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], which gave full self-government to the [[British Dominions]] and recognised each Dominion as having a separate crown. Thus, at his Canadian residence, [[Rideau Hall]], George VI personally accepted and approved the [[Letter of Credence]] of the newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to Canada, [[Daniel Calhoun Roper]]. The official royal tour historian, [[Gustave Lanctot]], stated: "When Their Majesties walked into their Canadian residence, the Statute of Westminster had assumed full reality: the King of Canada had come home."<ref>{{citation| last=Galbraith| first=William| title=Fiftieth Anniversary of the 1939 Royal Visit| journal=Canadian Parliamentary Review| volume=12| issue=3| pages=7<U+2013>9| publisher=Commonwealth Parliamentary Association| location=Ottawa| year=1989| url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/12/3/12n3_89e.pdf| accessdate=14 December 2009|format=PDF}}</ref>

The trip was intended to soften the strong [[isolationism|isolationist]] tendencies among the North American public with regard to the developing tensions in Europe. Although the aim of the tour was mainly political, to shore up Atlantic support for the United Kingdom in any future war, the King and Queen were enthusiastically received by the public.<ref>Judd, pp. 163<U+2013>166; Rhodes James, pp. 154<U+2013>168; Vickers, p. 187</ref> The fear that George would be compared unfavourably to his predecessor, Edward VIII, was dispelled.<ref>Bradford, pp. 298<U+2013>299</ref> They visited the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] and stayed with President [[Franklin D.

They were subject to [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|rationing restrictions]], and [[First Lady of the United States|U.S. First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] remarked on the rationed food served and the limited bathwater that was permitted during a stay at the unheated and boarded-up Palace.<ref>{{citation|last=Goodwin|first=Doris Kearns|authorlink=Doris Kearns Goodwin|title=No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II|location=New York|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=1994|page=380}}</ref> In August 1942, the King's brother, [[Prince George, Duke of Kent]], was killed on active service.<ref>Judd, p. 187; Weir, p. 324</ref>

In 1940, [[Winston Churchill]] replaced Neville Chamberlain as Prime Minister, though personally George would have preferred to appoint [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]].<ref>Judd, p. 180</ref> After the King's initial dismay over Churchill's appointment of [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] to the Cabinet, he and Churchill developed "the closest personal relationship in modern British history between a monarch and a Prime Minister".<ref>Rhodes James, p. 195</ref> Every Tuesday for four and a half years from September 1940, the two men met privately for lunch to discuss the war in secret and with frankness.<ref>Rhodes James, pp. 202<U+2013>210</ref>

Throughout the war, the King and Queen provided morale-boosting visits throughout the United Kingdom, visiting bomb sites and munitions factories, and in the King's case visiting military forces abroad. He visited France in December 1939, North Africa and [[Malta]] in June 1943, [[Normandy]] in June 1944, southern Italy in July 1944, and the Low Countries in October 1944.<ref>Judd, pp. 176, 201<U+2013>203, 207<U+2013>208</ref> Their high public profile and apparently indefatigable determination secured their place as symbols of national resistance.<ref>Judd, p. 170</ref> While talking to the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]], Sir [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Alan Brooke]] at a social function in 1944 about [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Field Marshal Montgomery]], Brooke mentioned that every time he met 'Monty' he thought he was after his job. The King replied: "You should worry, when I meet him, I always think he's after mine!"<ref>Reagan, Geoffrey. Military Anecdotes (1992) p. 25 Guinness Publishing ISBN 0-85112-519-0</ref>

In 1945, crowds shouted "We want the King!" in front of Buckingham Palace during the [[Victory in Europe Day]] celebrations. In an echo of Chamberlain's appearance, the King invited Churchill to appear with him on the balcony to public acclaim.<ref>Judd, p. 210</ref> 

In January 1946, George addressed the United Nations at their first assembly, which was held in London, and reaffirmed "our faith in the equal rights of men and women and of nations great and small".<ref>Townsend, p. 173</ref>

== Empire to Commonwealth ==
[[File:Attlee with GeorgeVI HU 59486.jpg|thumb|left|George VI (right) with British prime minister [[Clement Attlee]], July 1945]]

George VI's reign saw the acceleration of the dissolution of the [[British Empire]]. The [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], had already acknowledged the evolution of the [[Dominion]]s into separate [[sovereignty|sovereign]] states. The process of transformation from an empire to a voluntary association of independent states, known as the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], gathered pace after the Second World War, especially during the ministry of [[Clement Attlee]].<ref>Townsend, p. 176</ref> [[British India]] became the two independent dominions of [[Dominion of India|India]] and [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]] in 1947.<ref>Townsend, pp. 229<U+2013>232, 247<U+2013>265</ref> George relinquished the title of [[Emperor of India]], and became King of India and King of Pakistan instead. In 1950 he ceased to be King of India when it became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations, but he remained King of Pakistan until his death and India recognised his new title of [[Head of the Commonwealth]]. Other countries left the Commonwealth, such as [[Burma]] in January 1948, [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine]] (divided between [[Israel]] and the Arab states) in May 1948 and the Republic of Ireland in 1949.<ref>Townsend, pp. 267<U+2013>270</ref>

In 1947, the King and his family toured Southern Africa.<ref>Townsend, pp. 221<U+2013>223</ref> The Prime Minister of the [[Union of South Africa]], [[Jan Smuts]], was facing an election and hoped to make political capital out of the visit.<ref>Judd, p. 223</ref> George was appalled, however, when instructed by the South African government to shake hands only with whites,<ref>Rhodes James, p. 295</ref> and referred to his South African bodyguards as "the [[Gestapo]]".<ref>Rhodes James, p. 294; Shawcross, p. 618</ref> Despite the tour, Smuts lost [[South African general election, 1948|the election the following year]], and the new government instituted a [[apartheid|strict policy of racial segregation]].

== Illness and death ==
[[File:George VI Farthing.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Farthing (British coin)|Farthing]] of George VI, 1951]]
The stress of the war had taken its toll on the King's health,<ref>{{citation|publisher=Official website of the British monarchy|title=King George VI|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/KingsandQueensoftheUnitedKingdom/TheHouseofWindsor/GeorgeVI.aspx|accessdate=22 April 2009}}</ref><ref>Judd, p. 225; Townsend, p. 174</ref> exacerbated by his heavy [[tobacco smoking|smoking]]<ref>Judd, p. 240</ref> and subsequent development of lung cancer among other ailments, including [[arteriosclerosis]] and possibly [[thromboangiitis obliterans]]. A planned tour of Australia and New Zealand was postponed after the King suffered an arterial blockage in his right leg, which threatened the loss of the leg and was treated with a right [[lumbar sympathectomy]] in March 1949.<ref>Rhodes James, pp. 314<U+2013>317</ref> Princess Elizabeth, the heiress presumptive, took on more royal duties as her father's health deteriorated. The delayed tour was re-organised, with Elizabeth and her husband, the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]], taking the place of the King and Queen. The King was well enough to open the [[Festival of Britain]] in May 1951, but on 23 September 1951, his left [[pneumonectomy|lung was removed]] after a malignant tumour was found.<ref>Bradford, p. 454; Rhodes James, p. 330</ref> In October 1951, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh went on a month-long tour of Canada; the trip had been delayed for a week due to the King's illness. At the [[State Opening of Parliament]] in November, the King's [[speech from the throne]] was read for him by the [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Gavin Simonds, 1st Viscount Simonds|Lord Simonds]].<ref>Rhodes James, p. 331</ref> His [[Royal Christmas Message|Christmas broadcast]] of 1951 was recorded in sections, and then edited together.<ref>Rhodes James, p. 334</ref>

On 31 January 1952, despite advice from those close to him, the King went to [[London Heathrow Airport|London Airport]] to see off Princess Elizabeth, who was going on her tour of Australia via [[Kenya]]. On the morning of 6 February, George VI was found dead in bed at [[Sandringham House]] in Norfolk. He had died from a [[coronary thrombosis]] in his sleep at the age of 56.<ref>Judd, pp. 247<U+2013>248</ref> His daughter Elizabeth flew back to Britain from Kenya as Queen Elizabeth II.

From 9 February for two days his coffin rested in [[St. Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham]], before [[lying in state]] at [[Palace of Westminster#Westminster Hall|Westminster Hall]] from 11 February.<ref>{{citation|title=Repose at Sandringham|work=Life|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dFQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA38|accessdate=26 December 2011|date=18 February 1952|publisher=Time Inc|page=38|id={{ISSN|00243019}}}}</ref> His funeral took place at [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], on the 15th.<ref>Bradford, p. 462</ref> He was interred initially in the Royal Vault until he was transferred to the King George VI Memorial Chapel inside St. George's on 26 March 1969.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.stgeorges-windsor.org/about-st-georges/royal-connection/burial/burials-in-the-chapel-since-1805.html|title=Royal Burials in the Chapel since 1805|publisher=Dean & Canons of Windsor|accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref> In 2002, fifty years after his death, the remains of his widow, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]], and the ashes of his younger daughter [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]], who both died that year, were interred in the chapel alongside him.

In the words of Labour M.P. [[George Hardie (Labour politician)|George Hardie]], the abdication crisis of 1936 did "more for republicanism than fifty years of propaganda".<ref>Hardie in the British House of Commons, 11 December 1936, quoted in Rhodes James, p. 115</ref> George VI wrote to his brother Edward that in the aftermath of the abdication he had reluctantly assumed "a rocking throne", and tried "to make it steady again".<ref>Letter from George VI to the Duke of Windsor, quoted in Rhodes James, p. 127</ref> He became king at a point when public faith in the monarchy was at a low ebb. During his reign his people endured the hardships of war, and imperial power was eroded. However, as a dutiful family man and by showing personal courage, he succeeded in restoring the popularity of the monarchy.<ref>{{Citation|last=Ashley|first=Mike|authorlink=Mike Ashley (writer)|year=1998|title=British Monarchs|publisher=Robinson|location=London|isbn=1-84119-096-9|pages=703<U+2013>704}}</ref><ref>Judd, pp. 248<U+2013>249</ref>

The [[George Cross]] and the [[George Medal]] were founded at the King's suggestion during the Second World War to recognise acts of exceptional civilian bravery.<ref>Judd, p. 186; Rhodes James, p. 216</ref> He bestowed the George Cross on the entire "island fortress of Malta" in 1943.<ref>Townsend, p. 137</ref> He was posthumously awarded the [[Ordre de la Lib<U+00E9>ration]] by the French government in 1960, one of only two people (the other being Churchill) to be awarded the medal after 1946.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.ordredelaliberation.fr/fr_doc/liste_compagnons.pdf|publisher=Ordre de la Lib<U+00E9>ration|accessdate=19 September 2009|format=PDF|title=List of Companions}}</ref>

There are a number of geographical features, roads, and institutions named after George VI. These include [[King George Hospital, London|King George Hospital]] in London; [[King George VI Reservoir]] in Surrey, United Kingdom; [[British Columbia Highway 99A|King George VI Highway]] and [[King George Station]] in [[Surrey, British Columbia]]; [[George VI Sound]] in Antarctica; and the [[King George VI Chase]], a horse race in the United Kingdom.

On screen, George VI has been portrayed by, among others, [[Colin Firth]], who won an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for the role in ''[[The King's Speech]]'', a 2010 film that won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].
