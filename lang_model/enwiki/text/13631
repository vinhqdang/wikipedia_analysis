'''Sociocultural evolution(ism)''' is an umbrella term for theories of '''cultural evolution''' and '''social evolution''', describing how [[culture]]s and [[society|societies]] have developed over time. Although such theories typically provide models for understanding the [[relationship]] between [[technology|technologies]], [[social structure]], the [[values]] of a [[society]], and how and why they change with [[time]], they vary as to the extent to which they describe specific mechanisms of [[variation]] and [[social change]].

Most 19th century and some 20th century approaches aimed to provide models for the evolution of [[humankind]] as a whole, arguing that different societies are at different stages of [[social development]]. At present this thread is continued to some extent within the [[World systems theory|World System]] approach (especially within its version produced by [[Andre Gunder Frank]]). Many of the more recent 20th-century approaches focus on changes specific to individual societies and reject the idea of directional change, or [[social progress]]. Most [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] and [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] work within the framework of modern theories of sociocultural evolution. Modern approaches to sociocultural evolution include [[neoevolutionism]], [[sociobiology]], [[theory of modernisation]] and [[theory of post-industrial society|theory of postindustrial society]]. 

==Overview== 
Virtually all [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] and [[sociology|sociologists]] assume that human beings have natural [[social animal|social tendencies]] and that particular human [[social behavior]]s have non-[[genetics|genetic]] causes and dynamics (i.e. they are learned in a [[social environment]] and through [[social interaction]]). Societies exist in complex [[social environment|social]] (i.e. interacting with other societies) and [[biotic environment|biotic]] (i.e. interacting with natural resources and constraints) environments, and [[adaptation|adapt]] themselves to these environments. It is thus inevitable that all societies change. 

Specific theories of social or cultural evolution are usually meant to explain differences between coeval societies, by positing that different societies are at different stages of development. Although such theories typically provide models for understanding the relationship between [[technology|technologies]], [[social structure]], or [[values]] of a [[society]], they vary as to the extent to which they describe specific mechanisms of variation and change.

Early sociocultural evolution theories&mdash;the theories of [[August Comte]], [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]&mdash;developed simultaneously but independently of [[Charles Darwin]]'s works and were popular from the late 19th century to the end of [[World War I]]. These 19th-century [[unilineal evolution]] theories claimed that societies start out in a ''primitive'' state and gradually become more ''civilised'' over time, and equated the [[culture]] and [[technology]] of [[Western civilisation]] with progress. Some forms of early sociocultural evolution theories (mainly unilineal ones) have led to much criticised theories like [[social Darwinism]], and [[scientific racism]], used in the past to justify existing policies of [[colonialism]] and [[slavery]], and to justify new policies such as [[eugenics]]. 

Most 19th-century and some 20th-century approaches aimed to provide models for the evolution of humankind as a single entity. Most 20th-century approaches, such as [[multilineal evolution]], however, focus on changes specific to individual societies. Moreover, they reject directional change (i.e. [[orthogenetic]], [[teleological]] or [[progress]]ive change). Most [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] work within the framework of multilineal evolution. Other contemporary approaches to social change include [[neoevolutionism]], [[sociobiology]], [[theory of modernisation]] and [[theory of post-industrial society|theory of postindustrial society]].

==Classical social evolutionism==
=== Development ===
The 14th century [[Islamic]] scholar [[Ibn Khaldun]], considered by some to be the father of sociology, concluded that societies are living organisms that experience cyclic birth, growth, maturity, decline, and ultimately death due to universal causes several centuries before the [[Western civilisation]] developed the science of sociology. Nonetheless, theories of social and cultural evolution were common in modern [[European thought]]. Prior to the 18th century, Europeans predominantly believed that societies on [[Earth]] were in a state of decline. European society held up the world of [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] as a standard to aspire to, and [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]] produced levels of technical accomplishment which Europeans of the [[Middle Ages]] sought to emulate. At the same time, [[Christianity]] taught that people lived in a debased world fundamentally inferior to the [[Garden of Eden]] and [[Heaven]]. During [[The Age of Enlightenment]], however, European self-confidence grew and the notion of [[progress]] became increasingly popular. It was during this period that what would later become known as "sociological and cultural evolution" would have its roots.

The Enlightenment thinkers often speculated that societies progressed through stages of increasing development and looked for the [[logic]], order and the set of scientific truths that determined the course of [[human history]]. [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], for example, argued that social development was an inevitable and determined process, similar to an acorn which has no choice but to become an oak tree. Likewise, it was assumed that societies start out primitive, perhaps in a [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbesian]] [[state of nature]], and naturally progress toward something resembling industrial Europe.

While earlier authors such as [[Michel de Montaigne]] discussed how societies change through time, it was truly the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] which proved key in the development of sociocultural evolution. After Scotland's [[Act of Union 1707|union]] with [[England]] in 1707, several Scottish thinkers pondered what the relationship between progress and the 'decadence' brought about by increased trade with England and the affluence it produced. The result was a series of "[[conjectural history|conjectural histories]]". Authors such as [[Adam Ferguson]], [[John Millar]], and [[Adam Smith]] argued that all societies pass through a series of four stages: hunting and gathering, pastoralism and nomadism, agricultural, and finally a stage of [[commerce]]. These thinkers thus understood the changes Scotland was undergoing as a transition from an agricultural to a [[mercantile]] society.

[[Image:Auguste Comte.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Auguste Comte]]
Philosophical concepts of progress (such as those expounded by the German philosopher [[G.W.F. Hegel]]) developed as well during this period. In [[France]] authors such as [[Claude Adrien Helv<U+00E9>tius]] and other [[philosophe]]s were influenced by this Scottish tradition. Later thinkers such as [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon|Comte de Saint-Simon]] developed these ideas. [[August Comte]] in particular presented a coherent view of social progress and a new discipline to study it&mdash;[[sociology]]. The founders of sociology spent decades attempting to define their new discipline. In the course of this effort they tried several highly divergent pathways, some suggested by methods and contents of other sciences, others invented outright by the imagination of the scholar.

These developments took place in a wider context. The first process was [[colonialism]]. Although [[imperialism|imperial powers]] settled most differences of opinion with their colonial subjects with force, increased awareness of non-Western peoples raised new questions for European scholars about the nature of society and culture. Similarly, effective [[administration]] required some degree of understanding of other cultures. Emerging theories of sociocultural evolution allowed Europeans to organise their new knowledge in a way that reflected and justified their increasing political and economic domination of others: colonised people were less evolved, colonising people were more evolved. When the 17th-century English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] described primeval man as living in conditions in which there are "no arts, no letters, no society" and his life as "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short", he was very much proclaiming a popular conception of the "[[savage]]." Everything that was good and civilised resulted from the slow development out of this lowly state. Even rationalistic philosophers like [[Voltaire]] implicitly assumed that enlightenment gradually resulted in the upward progress of humankind.

The second process was the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the rise of [[capitalism]] which allowed and promoted continual revolutions in the [[means of production]]. Emerging theories of sociocultural evolution reflected a belief that the changes in Europe wrought by the Industrial Revolution and capitalism were obvious improvements. Industrialisation, combined with the intense political change brought about by the [[French Revolution]], [[U.S. Constitution]] and [[Polish Constitution of May 3, 1791]], which were paving the way for the [[history of democracy|dominance of democracy]], forced European thinkers to reconsider some of their assumptions about how society was organised.

Eventually, in the 19th century three great classical theories of social and historical change were created: the sociocultural evolutionism, the [[social cycle]] theory and the [[Marxist]] [[historical materialism]] theory. Those theories had one common factor: they all agreed that the history of humanity is pursuing a certain fixed path, most likely that of the [[social progress]]. Thus, each past event is not only chronologically, but causally tied to the present and future events. Those theories postulated that by recreating the sequence of those events, sociology could discover the [[history|laws of history]].

=== Sociocultural evolutionism and the idea of progress ===
{{main|Unilineal evolution}}
While sociocultural evolutionists agree that the evolution-like process leads to [[social progress]], classical social evolutionists have developed many different theories, known as theories of [[unilineal evolution]]. Sociocultural evolutionism was the prevailing theory of early sociocultural anthropology and [[social commentary]], and is associated with scholars like [[August Comte]], [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], [[Lewis Henry Morgan]], [[Benjamin Kidd]], [[L.T. Hobhouse]] and [[Herbert Spencer]]. Sociocultural evolutionism represented an attempt to formalise social thinking along scientific lines, later influenced by the biological theory of [[evolution]]. If organisms could develop over time according to discernable, deterministic laws, then it seemed reasonable that societies could as well. They developed analogies between human society and the biological organism and introduced into sociological theory such biological concepts as [[variation]], [[natural selection]], and [[inheritance]]&mdash;evolutionary factors resulting in the progress of societies through stages of savagery and barbarism to civilisation, by virtue of the [[survival of the fittest]]. Together with the idea of progress there grew the notion of fixed "stages" through which human societies progress, usually numbering three&mdash;savagery, barbarism, and civilisation&mdash;but sometimes many more. The [[Marquis de Condorcet]] listed 10 stages, or "epochs", the final one having started with the French Revolution, which was destined, in his eyes, to usher in the rights of man and the perfection of the human race. Some writers also perceived in the growth stages of each individual a recapitulation of these stages of society. Strange customs were thus accounted for on the assumption that they were throwbacks to earlier useful practices. This also marked the beginning of [[anthropology]] as a scientific discipline and a departure from traditional religious views of "primitive" cultures.
[[image:Herbert Spencer.jpg|thumb|200px|Herbert Spencer.]]

The term "Classical Social Evolutionism" is most closely associated with the 19th-century writings of [[Auguste Comte]], [[Herbert Spencer]] (who coined the phrase "[[survival of the fittest]]") and [[William Graham Sumner]]. In many ways Spencer's theory of "[[cosmic evolution]]" has much more in common with the works of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] and August Comte than with contemporary works of [[Charles Darwin]]. Spencer also developed and published his theories several years earlier than Darwin. In regard to social institutions, however, there is a good case that Spencer's writings might be classified as 'Social Evolutionism'. Although he wrote that societies over time progressed, and that progress was accomplished through competition, he stressed that the [[individual]] (rather than the [[collectism|collectivity]]) is the unit of analysis that evolves, that evolution takes place through natural selection and that it affects social as well as biological phenomenon. Nonetheless, the publication of Darwin's works proved a boon to the proponents of sociocultural evolution. The world of social science took the ideas of biological evolution as an attractive solution to similar questions regarding the origins and development of social behaviour and the idea of a society as an evolving organism was a biological analogy that is taken up by many anthropologists and sociologists even today.

Both Spencer and Comte view the society as a kind of organism subject to the process of [[growth]]&mdash;from simplicity to complexity, from chaos to order, from generalisation to specialisation, from flexibility to organisation. They agreed that the process of societies growth can be divided into certain stages, have their beginning and eventual end, and that this growth is in fact [[social progress]]&mdash;each newer, more evolved society is better. Thus [[progressivism]] became one of the basic ideas underlying the theory of sociocultural evolutionism.

[[August Comte]], known as father of sociology, formulated the [[law of three stages]]: human development progresses from the [[theology|theological]] stage, in which nature was mythically conceived and man sought the explanation of natural phenomena from supernatural beings, through [[metaphysics|metaphysical stage]] in which nature was conceived of as a result of obscure forces and man sought the explanation of natural phenomena from them until the final [[Positivism#Social Science|positive]] stage in which all abstract and obscure forces are discarded, and natural phenomena are explained by their constant relationship. This progress is forced through the development of human mind, and increasing application of thought, reasoning and logic to the understanding of the world.{{ref|comte}}

Herbert Spencer, who believed that society was evolving toward increasing freedom for individuals; and so held that government intervention ought to be minimal in social and political life, differentiated between two phases of development, focusing is on the type of internal regulation within societies. Thus he differentiated between [[military]] and [[industry|industrial]] societies. The earlier, more primitive military society has a goal of [[conquest]] and [[defense (military)|defence]], is [[centralisation|centralised]], [[economy|economically]] self-sufficient, [[collective|collectivistic]], puts the good of a group over the good of an individual, uses compulsion, force and repression, rewards loyalty, obedience and discipline. The industrial society has a goal of [[production]] and [[trade]], is [[decentralisation|decentralised]], interconnected with other societies via economic relations, achieves its goals through voluntary cooperation and individual self-restraint, treats the good of individual as the highest value, regulates the social life via voluntary relations, values initiative, independence and innovation.{{ref|spencer}}

Regardless of how scholars of Spencer interpret his relation to Darwin, Spencer proved to be an incredibly popular figure in the 1870s, particularly in the [[United States]]. Authors such as [[Edward Youmans]], [[William Graham Sumner]], [[John Fiske]], [[John W. Burgess]], [[Lester Frank Ward]], [[Lewis H. Morgan]] and other thinkers of the [[gilded age]] all developed similar theories of social evolutionism as a result of their exposure to Spencer as well as Darwin.

[[Image:Morgan.jpg|left|frame|Lewis H. Morgan]]
[[Lewis H. Morgan]], an [[anthropology|anthropologist]] whose ideas have had much impact on sociology, in his 1877 classic ''Ancient Societies'' differentiated between three eras: [[savagery]], [[barbarism]] and [[civilisation]], which are divided by technological inventions, like [[fire]], [[bow (weapon)|bow]], [[pottery]] in savage era, [[domestication of animals]], [[agriculture]], [[metalworking]] in barbarian era and [[alphabet]] and [[writing]] in civilisation era. Thus Morgan introduced a link between the [[social progress]] and [[technological progress]]. Morgan viewed the technological progress as a force behind the social progress, and any [[social change]]&mdash;in [[social institution]]s, organisations or ideologies have their beginning in the change of technology.{{ref|morgan}} Morgan's theories were popularised by [[Friedrich Engels]], who based his famous work ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]'' on it. For Engels and other [[Marxist]]s, this theory was important as it supported their conviction that materialistic factors&mdash;economical and technological&mdash;are decisive in shaping the fate of humanity.

[[Emile Durkheim]], another of the "fathers" of sociology, has developed a similar, [[dichotomy|dichotomal]] view of social progress. His key concept was [[social solidarity]], as he defined the social evolution in terms of progressing from [[mechanical solidarity]] to [[organic solidarity]]. In mechanical solidarity, people are self-sufficient, there is little integration and thus there is the need for use of force and repression to keep society together. In organic solidarity, people are much more integrated and interdependent and specialisation and cooperation is extensive. Progress from mechanical to organic solidarity is based first on [[population growth]] and increasing [[population density]], second on increasing "morality density" (development of more complex [[social interaction]]s) and thirdly, on the increasing specialisation in workplace. To Durkheim, the most important factor in the social progress is the [[division of labour]].
[[image:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Emile Durkheim]]

[[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] [[Edward Burnett Tylor|Sir E.B. Tylor]] in England and [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] in the United States worked with data from [[indigenous people]], whom they claimed represented earlier stages of cultural evolution that gave insight into the process and progression of evolution of culture. Morgan would later have a significant influence on [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], who developed a theory of sociocultural evolution in which the internal contradictions in society created a series of escalating stages that ended in a socialist society (see [[Marxism]]). Tylor and Morgan elaborated the theory of unilinear evolution, specifying criteria for categorising cultures according to their standing within a fixed system of growth of humanity as a whole and examining the modes and mechanisms of this growth. Theirs was often a concern with culture in general, not with individual cultures.

Their analysis of cross-cultural data was based on three assumptions:
# contemporary societies may be classified and ranked as more "primitive" or more "civilised";
# There are a determinate number of stages between "primitive" and "civilised" (e.g. [[Band society|band]], [[tribe]], [[chiefdom]], and [[state]]), 
# All societies progress through these stages in the same sequence, but at different rates.
Theorists usually measured progression (that is, the difference between one stage and the next) in terms of increasing social complexity (including class differentiation and a complex division of labour), or an increase in intellectual, theological, and aesthetic sophistication. These 19th-century [[Ethnology|ethnologists]] used these principles primarily to explain differences in religious beliefs and kinship terminologies among various societies.

[[Lester Frank Ward]] developed Spencer's theory but unlike Spencer, who considered the evolution to be general process applicable to the entire world, physical and sociological, Ward differentiated sociological evolution from biological evolution. He stressed that humans create goals for themselves and strive to realise them, whereas there is no such intelligence and awareness guiding the non-human world, which develops more or less at random. He created a hierarchy of evolution processes. First, there is [[cosmogenesis]], creation and evolution of the world. Then, after life develops, there is [[biogenesis]]. Development of humanity leads to [[anthropogenesis]], which is influenced by the [[human mind]]. Finally, when [[society]] develops, so does [[sociogenesis]], which is the science of shaping the society to fit with various political, cultural and ideological goals.

[[image:Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Edward Burnett Tylor]]
[[Edward Burnett Tylor]], pioneer of [[anthropology]], focused on the [[evolution of culture]] worldwide, noting that culture is an important part of every society and that it is also subject to the process of evolution. He believed that societies were at different stages of cultural development and that the purpose of anthropology was to reconstruct the evolution of culture, from primitive beginnings to the modern state.

[[Ferdinand T<U+00F6>nnies]] describes the evolution as the development from informal society, where people have many liberties and there are few laws and obligations, to modern, formal rational society, dominated by traditions and laws and are restricted from acting as they wish. He also notes that there is a tendency of [[standardisation]] and [[unification]], when all smaller societies are absorbed into the single, large, modern society. Thus T<U+00F6>nnies can be said to describe part of the process known today as the [[globalisation]]. T<U+00F6>nnies was also one of the first sociologists to claim that the evolution of society is not necessarily going in the right direction, that the [[social progress]] is not perfect, and it can even be called a [[regress]] as the newer, more evolved societies are obtained only after paying a high cost, resulting in decreasing satisfaction of individuals making up that society. T<U+00F6>nnies' work became the foundation of [[neoevolutionism]].

[[Image:Max Weber.jpg|thumb|Max Weber]]
Although not usually counted as a sociocultural evolutionist, [[Max Weber]]'s theory of [[tripartite classification of authority]] can be viewed as an evolutionary theory as well. Weber distinguishes three [[ideal type]]s of political [[leadership]], [[domination]] and [[authority]]: [[charismatic domination]] (familial and religious), [[traditional domination]] (patriarchs, patrimonalism, feudalism) and [[legal domination|legal (rational) domination]] (modern law and state, bureaucracy). He also notes that legal domination is the most advanced, and that societies evolve from having mostly traditional and charismatic authorities to mostly rational and legal ones.

===Critique and impact on modern theories===
<!--[[Image:FranzBoas.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Franz Boas]] removed image due to fair use problems raised during FAC process, please reinstert if fixed-->
The early 20th century inaugurated a period of systematic critical examination, and rejection of the sweeping generalisations of the unilineal theories of sociocultural evolution. [[Cultural anthropology|Cultural anthropologists]] such as [[Franz Boas]], and his students like [[Ruth Benedict]] and [[Margaret Mead]], typically regarded as the leader of anthropology's rejection of classical social evolutionism, used sophisticated [[ethnography]] and more rigorous empirical methods to argue that Spencer, Tylor, and Morgan's theories were speculative and systematically misrepresented ethnographic data. Theories regarding "stages" of evolution were especially criticised as illusions. Additionally, they rejected the distinction between "primitive" and "civilised" (or "modern"), pointing out that so-called primitive contemporary societies have just as much history, and were just as evolved, as so-called civilised societies. They therefore argued that any attempt to use this theory to reconstruct the histories of non-literate (i.e. leaving no historical documents) peoples is entirely speculative and unscientific. They observed that the postulated progression, which typically ended with a stage of civilisation identical to that of modern Europe, is [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]]. They also pointed out that the theory assumes that societies are clearly bounded and distinct, when in fact cultural traits and forms often cross social boundaries and diffuse among many different societies (and is thus an important mechanism of change). Boas introduced the [[culture history]] approach, which concentrated on fieldwork among native peoples to identify actual cultural and historical processes rather than speculative stages of growth. This "culture history" approach dominated American anthropology for the first half of the 20th century and so influenced anthropology elsewhere that high-level generalisation and "systems building" became far less common than in the past.

Later critics observed that this assumption of firmly bounded societies was proposed precisely at the time when European powers were colonising non-Western societies, and was thus self-serving. Many anthropologists and social theorists now consider unilineal cultural and social evolution a Western [[mythology|myth]] seldom based on solid empirical grounds. Critical theorists argue that notions of social evolution are simply justifications for [[power (sociology)|power]] by the elites of society. Finally, the devastating World Wars that occurred between 1914 and 1945 crippled Europe's self-confidence. After millions of deaths, genocide, and the destruction of Europe's industrial infrastructure, the idea of progress seemed dubious at best. 

Thus modern sociocultural evolutionism rejects most of classical social evolutionism due to various theoretical problems: 
# The theory was deeply [[ethnocentric]]&mdash;it makes heavy value judgements on different societies; with [[Western civilisation]] seen as the most valuable.
# It assumed all cultures follow the same path or progression and have the same goals.
# It equated [[civilisation]] with [[material culture]] (technology, cities, etc.)
# It equated [[evolution]] with [[progress]] or ''[[survival of the fittest|fitness]],'' based on deep misunderstandings of [[evolutionary theory]].
# It is greatly contradicted by evidence. Many (but not all) supposedly primitive societies are arguably more peaceful and equitable/democratic than many modern societies, and tend to be healthier with regard to [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and [[ecology]].

Because social evolution was posited as a scientific theory, it was often used to support unjust and often [[racist]] social practices&mdash;particularly [[colonialism]], [[slavery]], and the unequal economic conditions present within industrialised [[Europe]]. [[Social Darwinism]] is especially criticised, as it led to some philosophies used by the [[Nazis]].

When the critique of classical social evolutionism became widely accepted, modern anthropological and sociological approaches changed to reflect their responses to the critique of their predecessor. Modern theories are careful to avoid unsourced, ethnocentric speculation, comparisons, or value judgements; more or less regarding individual societies as existing within their own historical contexts. These conditions provided the context for new theories such as [[cultural relativism]] and [[multilineal evolution]].

In 1941 anthropologist [[Robert Redfield]] wrote about a shift from 'folk society' to 'urban society'. By the 1940s cultural anthropologists such as [[Leslie White]] and [[Julian Steward]] sought to revive an evolutionary model on a more scientific basis, and succeeded in establishing an approach known as the [[neoevolutionism]]. White rejected the opposition between "primitive" and "modern" societies but did argue that societies could be distinguished based on the amount of energy they harnessed, and that increased energy allowed for greater social differentiation ([[White's law]]). Steward on the other hand rejected the 19th-century notion of progress, and instead called attention to the Darwinian notion of "adaptation", arguing that all societies had to adapt to their environment in some way. 

The anthropologists [[Marshall Sahlins]] and [[Elman Service]] wrote a book, ''Evolution and Culture'', in which they attempted to synthesise White's and Steward's approaches{{ref|sahlins}}. Other anthropologists, building on or responding to work by White and Steward, developed theories of cultural ecology and ecological anthropology. The most prominent examples are [[Peter Vayda]] and [[Roy Rappaport]]. By the late 1950s, students of Steward such as [[Eric Wolf]] and [[Sidney Mintz]] turned away from cultural ecology to [[Marxism]], [[World Systems Theory]], [[Dependency theory]] and [[Marvin Harris]]'s [[Cultural materialism]].

Today most anthropologists continue to reject 19th-century notions of progress and the three original assumptions of unilineal evolution. Following Steward, they take seriously the relationship between a culture and its environment in attempts to explain different aspects of a culture. But most modern cultural anthropologists have adopted a general systems approach, examining cultures as emergent systems and argue that one must consider the whole social environment, which includes political and economic relations among cultures. There are still others who continue to reject the entirety of the evolutionary thinking and look instead at historical contingencies, contacts with other cultures, and the operation of cultural symbol systems. As a result, the simplistic notion of "cultural evolution" has grown less useful and given way to an entire series of more nuanced approaches to the relationship of culture and environment. In the area of development studies, authors such as [[Amartya Sen]] have developed an understanding of "development" and 'human flourishing' that also question more simplistic notions of progress, while retaining much of their original inspiration.

==== Neoevolutionism ====
{{main|Neoevolutionism}}

Neoevolutionism is the first theory of the series of modern multilineal evolution theories. It  emerged in 1930s and extensively developed in the period following the [[Second World War]] and was incorporated into both  [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]] in the 1960s. It bases its theories on the empirical evidences from areas of [[archaeology]], [[palaeontology]] and [[historiography]] and tries to eliminate any references to [[system of value]]s, be it moral or cultural, instead trying to remain objective and simply descriptive.

While 19th-century evolutionism explained how culture develops by giving general principles of its evolutionary process, it was dismissed by the [[Historical Particularists]] as unscientific in the early 20th century. It was the neoevolutionary thinkers who brought back evolutionary thought and developed it to be acceptable to contemporary anthropology. 

The neoevolutionism discards many ideas of classical social evolutionism, namely that of [[social progress]], so dominant in previous sociology evolution-related theories. Then neoevolutionism discards the [[determinism]] argument and introduces [[probability]], arguing that accidents and free will have much impact on the process of social evolution. It also supports the [[counterfactual history]]&mdash;asking "what if" and considering different possible path that social evolution may (or might have) taken, and thus allows for the fact that various cultures may develop in different ways, some skipping entire stages others have passed through. The neoevolutionism stresses the importance of [[empirical]] evidence. While 19th-century evolutionism used value judgment and assumptions for interpreting data, neoevolutionism relied on measurable information for analysing the process of sociocultural evolution. 

[[Leslie White]], author of ''The Evolution of Culture: The Development of Civilization to the Fall of Rome'' (1959), attempted to create a theory explaining the entire history of humanity. The most important factor in his theory is [[technology]]: ''[[Social system]]s are determined by [[technological system]]s'', wrote White in his book {{ref|White}}, echoing the earlier theory of [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]. As measure of society advancement, he proposed the measure of a society's [[energy consumption]]. He differentiates between five stages of human development. In first, people use energy of their own muscles. In second, they use energy of [[domestication of animals|domesticated animals]]. In third, they use the energy of plants (so White refers to [[agricultural revolution]] here). In fourth, they learn to use the energy of natural resources: coal, oil, gas. In fifth, they harness the [[nuclear energy]]. White introduced a formulae, P=E*T, where E is a measure of energy consumed, and T is the measure of efficiency of technical factors utilising the energy. This theory is similar to Russian astronomer [[Nikolai Kardashev]]'s later theory of the [[Kardashev scale]].

[[Julian Steward]], author of ''Theory of Culture Change: The Methodology of Multilinear Evolution'' (1955, reprinted 1979), created the theory of "multilinear" evolution which examined the way in which societies adapted to their environment. This approach was more nuanced than White's theory of "unilinear evolution." Steward on the other hand rejected the 19th-century notion of progress, and instead called attention to the Darwinian notion of "adaptation", arguing that all societies had to adapt to their environment in some way. He argued that different adaptations could be studied through the examination of the specific resources a society exploited, the technology the society relied on to exploit these resources, and the organisation of human labour. He further argued that different environments and technologies would require different kinds of adaptations, and that as the resource base or technology changed, so too would a culture. In other words, cultures do not change according to some inner logic, but rather in terms of a changing relationship with a changing environment. Cultures would therefore not pass through the same stages in the same order as they changed&mdash;rather, they would change in varying ways and directions. He called his theory "multilineal evolution". He questioned the possibility of creation of a social theory encompassing the entire evolution of humanity; however, he argued that anthropologists are not limited to description of specific existing cultures. He believed it is possible to create theories analysing typical common culture, representative of specific eras or regions. As the decisive factors determining the development of given culture he pointed to technology and economics, and noted there are secondary factors, like political system, ideologies and religion. All those factors push the evolution of given society in several directions at the same time; thus, this is the multilinearity of his theory of evolution.

[[Marshall Sahlins]], author of ''Evolution and Culture'' (1960), divided the evolution of societies into 'general' and 'specific'. General evolution is the tendency of cultural and social systems to increase in complexity, organisation and adaptiveness to environment. However, as the various cultures are not isolated, there is interaction and a [[Diffusionism|diffusion]] of their qualities (like technological [[invention]]s). This leads cultures to develop in different ways (specific evolution), as various elements are introduced to them in different combinations and on different stages of evolution.

[[Gerhard Lenski]] in his ''Power and Prestige'' (1966) and ''Human Societies: An Introduction to Macrosociology'' (1974) he expands on the works of [[Leslie White]] and [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]. He views the [[technological progress]] as the most basic factor in the evolution of societies and cultures. Unlike White, who defined technology as the ability to create and utilise [[energy]], Lenski focuses on [[information]]&mdash;its amount and uses. The more information and knowledge (especially allowing the shaping of natural environment) a given society has, the more advanced it is. He distinguished four stages of human development, based on the advances in the [[history of communication]]. In the first stage, information is passed by [[gene]]s. In the second, when humans gain [[sentience]], they can [[learn]] and pass information through by experience. In the third, the humans start using [[signs]] and develop [[logic]]. In the fourth, they can create [[symbol]]s, develop [[language]] and [[writing]]. Advancements in the technology of communication translates into advancements in the [[economic system]] and [[political system]], [[distribution of goods]], [[social inequality]] and other spheres of social life. He also differentiates societies based on their level of technology, communication and economy: (1) hunters and gatherers, (2) simple agricultural, (3) advanced agricultural, (4) industrial (5) special (like fishing societies).

[[Talcott Parsons]], author of ''Societies: Evolutionary and Comparative Perspectives'' (1966) and ''The System of Modern Societies'' (1971) divided evolution into four subprocesses: (1) division, which creates functional subsystems from the main system; (2) adaptation, where those systems evolve into more efficient versions; (3) inclusion of elements previously excluded from the given systems; and (4) generalisation of values, increasing the legitimisation of the ever more complex system. He shows those processes on 3 stages of evolution: (1) primitive, (2) archaic and (3) modern. Archaic societies have the knowledge of [[writing]], while modern have the knowledge of [[law]]. Parsons viewed the [[Western civilisation]] as the pinnacle of modern societies, and out of all western cultures he declared [[United States]] as the most dynamic developed.

==== Sociobiology ====
{{main|Sociobiology}}

[[Sociobiology]] departs perhaps the furthest from the classical social evolutionism. It was introduced by [[Edward Wilson]] in his 1975 book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'' and followed his adaptation of biological theory [[neo-Darwinism]] to the field of social sciences. Wilson pioneered the attempt to explain the evolutionary mechanics behind social behaviours such as [[altruism]], [[aggression]], and nurturance. In doing so, Wilson sparked one of the greatest scientific [[controversy|controversies]] of the 20th century.

Sociobiologists have argued for a [[dual inheritance theory]], which posits that humans are products of both biological evolution and sociocultural evolution, each subject to their own selective mechanisms and forms of transmission (i.e. in the case of biology, [[genes]], and for culture possibly [[memes]]). This approach focuses on both the mechanisms of cultural transmission and the selective pressures that influence cultural change. This version of sociocultural evolution shares little in common with the stadial evolutionary models of the early and mid-20th century. This approach has been embraced by many [[Psychology|psychologists]] and some [[Cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]], but very few [[Physical anthropology|physical anthropologists]].

[[Neo-Darwinism]], also known as the ''modern evolutionary synthesis'', generally denotes the combination of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of the [[evolution]] of [[species]] by [[natural selection]], [[Gregor Mendel]]'s theory of [[genetics]] as the basis for biological inheritance and mathematical [[population genetics]]. Essentially, the modern synthesis (or neo-Darwinism) introduced the connection between two important discoveries; the units of evolution ([[gene]]s) with the mechanism of evolution ([[natural selection|selection]]).

Due to its close reliance on biology, sociobiology is often considered a branch of the biology and sociology disciplines, although it uses techniques from a plethora of sciences, including [[ethology]], [[evolution]], [[zoology]], [[archaeology]], [[population genetics]], and many others. Within the study of human [[societies]], sociobiology is closely related to the fields of [[human behavioral ecology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]]. 

Sociobiology has remained highly controversial as it contends [[genes]] play a role in human behaviour, although sociobiologists describe this role as a very complex and often unpredictable interaction between nature and nurture. The most notable critics of the view that genes play a direct role in human behaviour have been [[Franz Boas]], [[Richard Lewontin]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]].

==== Theory of modernisation ====
{{main|Modernization theory}}
Theories of [[modernisation]] have been developed and popularised in 1950s and 1960s and is closely related to the [[dependency theory]] and [[development theory]]. It combines the previous theories of sociocultural evolution with practical experiences and empirical research, especially those from the era of [[decolonisation]]. The theory states that:
* Western countries are the most developed, and rest of the world (mostly former colonies) are on the earlier stages of development, and will eventually reach the same level as the Western world
* Development stages go from the traditional societies to developed ones
* [[Third World]] countries have fallen behind with their [[social progress]] and need to be directed on their way to becoming more advanced
Developing from classical social evolutionism theories, theory of modernisation stresses the modernisation factor: many societies are simply trying (or need to) emulate the most successful societies and cultures. It also states that it is possible to do so, thus supporting the concepts of [[social engineering]] and that the developed countries can and should help those less developed, directly or indirectly.

Among the scientists who contributed much to this theory are [[Walt Rostow]], who in his ''The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto'' (1960) concentrates on the [[economic system]] side of the modernisation, trying to show factors needed for a country to reach the path to modernisation in his [[Rostovian take-off model]]. [[David Apter]] concentrated on the [[political system]] and [[history of democracy]], researching the connection between [[democracy]], good [[governance]] and efficiency and modernisation. [[David McClelland]] (''The Achieving Society'', 1967) approached this subject from the [[psychology|psychological]] perspective , with his [[motivation]]s theory, arguing that modernisation cannot happen until given society values innovation, success and free enterprise. [[Alex Inkeles]] (''Becoming Modern'', 1974) similarly creates a model of ''modern personality'', which needs to be independent, active, interested in public policies and cultural matters, open for new experiences, rational and being able to create long-term plans for the future. Some works of [[J<U+00FC>rgen Habermas]] are also connected with this subfield.

Theory of modernisation has been subject to some criticism similar to that levied on classical social evolutionism, especially for being too [[ethnocentric]], one-sided and focused on the Western world and culture.

==== Theory of postindustrial society ====
{{main|Theory of postindustrial society}}
The very concept of evolution has made some scientists try to analyse various trends and predict the future development of societies. have created the theories of [[post-industrial society|postindustrial societies]], arguing that the current era of [[industrial society]] is coming to an end, and [[service]]s and information are becoming more important than [[industry]] and [[good (economics)|good]]s.

<!--[[Image:Danielbell.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Daniel Bell]] removed image due to unknown copyright status, please reinstert if fixed-->
In [[1974]] [[Daniel Bell]], author of ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society'', introduced the concept of [[postindustrial society]]. Like many more classical evolutionists, he divided the history of humanity into three eras: pre-industrial, industrial and postindustrial. He predicted that by the end of the 20th century, United States, Japan and Western Europe would reach the postindustrial stage. This would be visible by:
* domination of the [[service sector]] (administration, banking, trade, transport, healthcare, education, science, mass media, culture) over the traditional [[industry sector]] (manufacturing industries, which have surpassed the more traditional, [[agriculture sector|agriculture and mining sector]] after the 19th-century [[Industrial Revolution]]);
* growing importance of [[information technology|information technologies]];
* increased role of long-term planning, modelling future trends;
* domination of [[technocracy]] and [[pragmatism]] over traditional [[ethic]]s and [[ideology|ideologies]];
* increasing importance and use of technology and intellect;
* changes in the traditional hierarchy of [[social class]]es, with highly educated specialists and scientists overtaking the traditional [[bourgeois]];

From the 1970s many other sociologist and anthropologists, like [[Alvin Toffler]] (''[[Future Shock]]'', 1970), and [[John Naisbitt]] (''Megatrends 2000: The New Directions for the 1990's'', 1982) have followed in Bell's footsteps and created similar theories. John Naisbitt introduced the concept of [[megatrend]]s: a powerful, global trends that are changing societies on the worldwide scale. Among those megatrends he mentions the process of [[globalisation]]. Another important megatrend was the increase in performance of computers and the development of the [[World Wide Web]]. [[Marshall McLuhan]] introduced the concept of [[global village]] (''The Gutenberg Galaxy'', 1962), and this term was soon adapted by the researchers of globalisation and the [[Internet]]. Naisbitt and many other proponents of the theory of postindustrial societies argues that those megatrends lead to [[decentralisation]], weakening of the [[central government]], increasing importance of local initiatives and [[direct democracy]], changes in the hierarchy of the traditional social classes, development of new [[social movement]]s and increased powers of consumers and number of choices available to them (Toffler even used the term "overchoice").

Some of the more extreme visions of the postindustrial society are those related to the theory of the [[technological singularity]].  This theory refers to a [[prediction|predicted]] point or period in the development of a civilisation at which due to the acceleration of [[technological progress]], the societal, scientific and economic change is so rapid that nothing beyond that time can be reliably comprehended, understood or predicted by the pre-Singularity [[human]]s. Such a singularity was first discussed in the 1950s, and vastly popularised in the 1980s by [[Vernor Vinge]]. Nonetheless, this extreme view is treated with much scepticism by many more conservative social scientists.

<!--[[Image:Vinge1.gif|thumb|right|200px|Vernor Vinge]] removed image due to unknown copyright status, please reinstert if fixed-->
Critics of the postindustrial society theory point out that it is very vague and as any prediction, there is no guarantee that any of the trends visible today will in fact exist in the future or develop in the directions predicted by contemporary researchers. However, no serious sociologist would argue it is possible to predict the future, but only that such theories allow us to gain a better understanding of the changes taking place in the modern world.

==Contemporary moral and political debates over sociocultural evolution==
The [[Cold War]] period was marked by rivalry between two superpowers, both of which considered themselves to be the most highly evolved cultures on the planet. The [[USSR]] painted itself as a [[socialism|socialist]] society which emerged out of [[class struggle]], destined to reach the [[utopia]]n state of [[communism]], while sociologists in the United States (such as [[Talcott Parsons]]) argued that the freedom and prosperity of the [[United States]] were a proof of a higher level of sociocultural evolution of its culture and society. At the same time, [[decolonisation]] created newly independent countries who sought to become more developed&mdash;a model of progress and industrialisation which was itself a form of sociocultural evolution. 

There is, however, a tradition in European [[social theory]] from [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] to [[Max Weber]] that argues that this progression coincides with a loss of human freedom and dignity. At the height of the Cold War, this tradition merged with an interest in [[ecology]] to influence an [[activist culture]] in the 1960s. This movement produced a variety of political and philosophical programs which emphasised the importance of bringing society and the environment into harmony. Current political theories of the [[new tribalists]] consciously mimic ecology and the life-ways of [[indigenous peoples]], augmenting them with modern sciences. [[Ecoregional Democracy]] attempts to confine the "[[shifting groups]]", or [[tribe]]s, within "more or less clear boundaries" that a society inherits from the surrounding [[ecology]], to the borders of a naturally occurring [[ecoregion]]. Progress can proceed by competition between but not within tribes, and it is limited by ecological borders or by [[Natural Capitalism]] incentives which attempt to mimic the pressure of [[natural selection]] on a human society by forcing it to adapt consciously to scarce energy or materials. [[Gaians]] argue that societies evolve deterministically to play a role in the ecology of their [[biosphere]], or else die off as failures due to competition from more efficient societies exploiting nature's leverage.

Thus, some have appealed to theories of sociocultural evolution to assert that optimising the ecology and the social harmony of closely knit groups is more desirable or necessary than the progression to "civilisation." A 2002 poll of experts on [[Nearctic]] and [[Neotropic]] [[indigenous peoples]] (reported in ''Harper's'' magazine) revealed that ''all of them'' would have preferred to be a typical New World person in the year 1491, prior to any European contact, rather than a typical European of that time.

This approach has been criticised by pointing out that there are a number of historical examples of indigenous peoples doing severe environmental damage (such as the [[deforestation]] of [[Easter Island]] and the extinction of [[mammoth]]s in [[North America]]) and that proponents of the goal have been trapped by the European stereotype of the [[noble savage]]. 

Today, [[postmodernists]] question whether the notions of evolution or society have inherent meaning and whether they reveal more about the person doing the description than the thing being described. Observing and observed cultures may lack sufficient cultural similarities (such as a common [[foundation ontology]]) to be able to communicate their respective priorities easily. Or, one may impose such a system of belief and judgment upon another, via [[conquest]] or [[colonisation]]. For instance, observation of very different ideas of [[mathematics]] and [[physics]] in [[indigenous peoples]] led indirectly to ideas such as [[George Lakoff]]'s "[[cognitive science of mathematics]]", which asks if measurement systems themselves can be objective.

Virtually all [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] and [[sociology|sociologists]] assume that human beings have natural [[social tendency|social tendencies]] and that particular human [[social behavior]]s have non-[[genetics|genetic]] causes and dynamics (i.e. they are learned in a [[social environment]] and through [[social interaction]]). Societies exist in both [[social environment|social]] (i.e. interacting with other societies) and [[biotic environment|biotic]] (i.e. interacting with natural resources and constraints) environments, and [[adaptation|adapt]] themselves to these environments. It is thus inevitable that all societies change.
