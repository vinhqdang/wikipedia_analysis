{{Korean name|Ban}}
'''Ban Ki-moon''' (born [[June 13]] [[1944]] in [[Eumseong]], [[North Chungcheong]],<!--South Korea did not exist as a state in 1944 --> [[Korea]])<ref name=Times12-09/> is a [[South Korea]]n [[diplomat]] and the current [[United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General]] of the [[United Nations]]. 

Before becoming Secretary-General, Ban was a career diplomat in South Korea's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (South Korea)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] and in the United Nations.  He entered diplomatic service the year he graduated college, accepting his first post in [[New Delhi]].  In the foreign ministry he established a reputation for modesty and competence.

Ban was the [[Foreign Minister]] of [[South Korea|the Republic of Korea]] from January 2004 to November 2006.  In February of 2006 he began to campaign for the office of Secretary-General.  Ban was initially considered a long shot for the office.  As foreign minister of Korea, however he was able to travel to all the countries on the [[United Nations Security Council]], a maneuver that turned him into the campaign's front runner.

On [[October 13]] [[2006]], he was elected to be the eighth Secretary-General by the [[United Nations General Assembly]].  On [[January 1]], [[2007]], he succeeded [[Kofi Annan]].  Ban struggled in his first month to adjust to the culture of the United Nations, but quickly found his bearings and passed  several major reforms on peacekeeping and UN employment practices.  Diplomatically, Ban has taken particularly strong views on [[global warming]], pressing the issue repeatedly with U.S. President [[George W. Bush]], and [[Darfur conflict|Darfur]], where he helped persuade Sudanese president [[Omar al-Bashir]] to allow peacekeeping troops to enter [[Sudan]].

==Early life==
Ban, the oldest of six children, was born in [[Eumseong]] in a small farming village in [[North Chungcheong]], in 1944, while Korea was [[Korea under Japanese rule|controlled by Japan]].  When he was three, his family moved to the nearby town of [[Chungju]], where he was raised.<ref name="NYT 12-22"/>  During Ban's childhood, his father had a warehouse business, but the warehouse went bankrupt and the family lost its middle-class standard of living.  When Ban was 6, his family fled to a remote mountainside for the duration of the [[Korean War]].<ref name=Times12-09/>  After the war, his family returned to Chungju.  The U.S. military troops in Korea were the first Americans Ban ever met.<ref name=LAT10-09/>

===Education===
In secondary school Ban became a star pupil, particularly in his studies of English.  According to local stories, Ban would regularly walk 6 miles to a fertilizer factory to practice English with the factory's American advisors.<ref name="NYT 12-22"/>  In 1956, he was selected by his class to address a message to then UN Secretary-General [[Dag Hammarskj<U+00F6>ld]], but it is unknown if the message was ever sent.  In 1962, Ban won an essay contest sponsored by the [[Red Cross]] and earned a trip to the [[United States]] where he lived in [[San Francisco]] with a host family for several months.<ref name=FT10-10/>  As part of the trip, Ban met U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref name=Times12-09/>  When asked by a journalist at the meeting what Ban wanted to be when he grew up, he said "I want to become a diplomat."<ref name=LAT10-09/>

Ban received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[international relations|International Relations]] from [[Seoul National University]] in 1970, and earned a [[Master of Public Administration|Master of Public Administration]] from the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] in 1985.<ref name=LAT10-09>{{Cite news | title = Aspiring U.N. Chief Is a Harmonizer, Not a Rock Star; South Korean career diplomat Ban Ki-moon may lack charisma, but he has many fans | work = [[The Los Angeles Times]] | author = Maggie Farley and Bruce Wallace | date = [[2006]]-[[10-09]]}}</ref>  At Harvard, he studied under [[Joseph Nye]] who remarked that Ban had "a rare combination of analytic clarity, humility and perseverance."<ref name=FT10-10/>

In addition to his native [[Korean language|Korean]], Ban speaks [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[German language|German]], according to his [[curriculum vitae]].  There have been questions, however, on the extent of his knowledge of [[French language|French]], one of the two working languages of the [[United Nations]].<ref name=Phoney/>

===Family===
Ban Ki-moon married his secondary school's student council president, Yoo Soon-taek, in 1971.  They are still married and have three adult children: two daughters and a son.<ref name=Times12-09/>  After his selection as UN Secretary-General, Ban became an icon in his home town, where his extended family still resides.  Over 50,000 gathered in a soccer stadium in Chungju for celebration.  In the months after his appointment, thousands of practitioners of [[feng shui]] went to his village to determine how it produced such an important person.<ref name="NYT 12-22">{{Cite news | title = On His Ancestors' Wings, a Korean Soars to the U.N. | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = [[2006]]-[[12-22]]| author = Martin Fackler}}</ref>  Ban himself is not a member of any church or religious group.<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.economist.com/world/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8525903 | work = [[The Economist]] | title = Correction: Ban Ki-moon | date = [[2007]]-[[01-11]] | accessdate = 2007-08-02 }}</ref>  His mother is reportedly [[Buddhist]].<ref name="NYT 12-22"/>

=== Personality ===
Ban's personality has been described as bland.  In the Korean Foreign Ministry his nickname was ''Ban-chusa'', meaning "the Bureaucrat" or "the administrative clerk".  The name was used as both positive and negative: complimenting Ban's attention to detail and administrative skill while deriding what was seen as a lack of charisma and subservience to his superiors.<ref name=Economist10-07>{{Cite news | title = Enter Mr Ban; The UN's new secretary-general | work = [[The Economist]] | date = [[2006]]-[[10-07]]}}</ref>  The Korean press corps calls him "the slippery eel" for his ability to dodge questions.<ref name=LAT10-09/>  His demeanor has also been described as a "[[Confucian]] approach".<ref name=Time>{{Cite news | title = Can This Guy Run the U.N.? | date = [[2006]]-[[10-16]] | work = [[Time Magazine]]}}</ref>  

Ban's work ethic is well-documented.  His schedule is reportedly broken into five-minute blocks; Ban claims to sleep for only five hours a night and to have never been late for work.  During the nearly three years he was foreign minister for South Korea the only vacation he took was for his daughter's wedding.<ref name=FT10-10/>  Ban has said that his only hobby is golf, and he only plays a couple games a year.<ref name=Times12-09/>

At the 2006 UN Correspondents dinner in early December, after being elected Secretary-General, Ban surprised the audience by singing a version of "[[Santa Claus Is Coming to Town]]", with the lyrics "Ban Ki-moon is coming to town" instead.<ref name="WashBolton">{{cite news | url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/12/AR2007011202061.html | title = Don't Ban Your Instincts, Ban Ki-moon | author = [[John R. Bolton]] | accessdate=2007-04-13 | date = [[2007]]-[[01-12]] |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>  A major aim of Ban's campaign for UN Secretary-General and a focus of his early days in office was allaying concerns that he was too dull for the job.<ref name=FT02-01/>

==Diplomatic career==
[[Image:Ban Ki-moon and Condoleezza Rice.jpg|thumb|left|Ban Ki-moon with [[Condoleezza Rice]].]]
After graduation from university, Ban received the top score on Korea's foreign service exam.  He joined the [[Foreign relations of South Korea|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] in May 1970, and worked his way up during the years of the [[Yusin Constitution]].<ref name=FT10-10/>

His first overseas posting was to [[New Delhi]] where he served as vice consul and impressed many of his superiors in the foreign ministry with his competence.  Ban reportedly accepted a posting to India rather than the more prestigious United States, because in [[India]] he would be able to save more money, and send more home to his family.<ref name=BBCprofile/><ref name=KH/> In 1974 he received his first posting to the United Nations, as First Secretary of the South Permanent Observer Mission (South Korea only became a full UN member state on [[September 17]], [[1991]]).<ref name=NYT10-03>{{Cite news | title = Council Backs South Korean for U.N. Secretary General | work = [[The New York Times]] | author = [[Warren Hoge]] | date = [[2006]]-[[10-03]]}}</ref>  After [[Park Chung Hee]]'s 1979 assassination, Ban assumed the post of Director of the United Nations Division.

In 1980 Ban became director of the United Nation's International Organizations and Treaties Bureau, headquartered in [[Seoul]].<ref name=KH/>  He has been posted twice to the [[Republic of Korea]] embassy in [[Washington, D.C.]] Between these two assignments he served as Director-General for American Affairs in 1990&ndash;92.  In 1992, he became Vice Chairman of the South-North Joint Nuclear Control Commission, following the adoption by South and [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea)|North Korea]] of the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the [[Korean Peninsula]].<ref name=BBCprofile/>  From 1993&ndash;94 Ban was Korea's deputy ambassador to the United States.  He was promoted to the position of Deputy Minister for Policy Planning and International Organizations in 1995 and then appointed National Security Advisor to the President in 1996.<ref name=KH/>  Ban's lengthy career overseas has been credited with helping him avoid South Korea's unforgiving political environment.<ref name=Time/>

Ban was appointed [[Ambassador]] to [[Austria]] in 1998, and a year later he was also elected as Chairman of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization ([[CTBTO]] PrepCom).  During the negotiations, in what Ban considers the biggest blunder of his career, he included a positive statement about the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] in a public letter with [[Russia]] in 2001, shortly after the [[United States]] had decided to abandon the treaty.  To avoid anger from the United States, Ban was fired by Korean President [[Kim Dae-jung]], who also issued a public apology for Ban's statement.<ref name=Times12-09/>

Ban was unemployed for the first and only time in his career and was expecting to receive an assignment to work in a remote and unimportant embassy.<ref name=Times12-09/>  In 2001, during the 56th Session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], the Republic of Korea held the rotating presidency, and to Ban's surprise, he was selected to be the chief of staff to general assembly president [[Han Seung-soo]].<ref name="Times10-14">{{Cite news | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = [[2006]]-[[10-14]] | title = South Korean Is Appointed Secretary General of the U.N. | author = [[Warren Hoge]]}}</ref>  In 2003, the new Korean President [[Roh Moo-hyun]] selected Ban as one of his foreign policy advisors.<ref name=KH/>

=== Foreign Minister of Korea ===
[[Image:Yudhoyono_BanKiMoon.jpg|thumb|Ban Ki-moon with Indonesian President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]].]]
In 2004, Ban replaced [[Yoon Young-kwan]] as foreign minister of Korea under president [[Roh Moo Hyun]].<ref name=LAT10-09/>  At the beginning of his term, Ban was faced with two major crises: in June of 2004 [[Kim Sun-il]], a Korean translator, was kidnapped and killed by Islamic extremists and in December of 2004 dozens of Koreans died in the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|2004 tsunami]].  Ban survived scrutiny from lawmakers and saw an upturn in his popularity when talks began with North Korea.<ref name=KH>{{Cite news | title = Ban surges toward next career step | author = Lee Joo-hee | work = [[The Korea Herald]] | date = [[2006]]-02-15}}</ref>  Ban became actively involved in issues relating to inter-Korean relationships.<ref name=BBCprofile>{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5401856.stm | title = Profile: Ban Ki-moon | work = [[BBC News]] | date = [[2006]]-[[10-13]] | accessdate = 2007-08-04}}</ref> In September 2005, as [[Foreign Minister]], he played a leading role in the diplomatic efforts to adopt the Joint Statement on resolving the North Korean nuclear issue at the Fourth Round of the [[Six-Party Talks]] held in [[Beijing]].<ref name="Official Bio"/><ref name="Newsweek">{{Cite news | title = A Baptism by Fire; Even before taking office, the newly elected secretary-general of the United Nations is confronted with a global crisis | date = [[2006]]-[[10-23]] | author = [[Lally Weymouth]] | work = [[Newsweek]]}}</ref>

As foreign minister, Ban oversaw the trade and aid policies of South Korea.  This work put Ban in the position of signing trade deals and delivering foreign assistance to diplomats who would later be influential in his candidacy for Secretary-General.  For example, Ban became the first senior South Korean minister to travel to the [[Congo]], a Security Council member, since its independence in 1960.<ref name=WashPost0929>{{Cite news | title = S.

===Awards===
Ban has been awarded the Order of Service Merit by the Government of the [[Republic of Korea]] on three occasions: in 1975, 1986 and 2006.<ref name="Official Bio">{{Cite web | url = http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml | title = Official U.N. biography | work = un.org | accessdate = 2007-08-12}}</ref>  For his accomplishments as an envoy, he received the Grand Decoration of Honour from the [[Republic of Austria]] in 2001.  He has received awards from many of the countries with which he has worked diplomatically: the government of [[Brazil]] bestowed the Grand Cross of Rio Branco upon him, the government of [[Peru]] awarded him Gran Cruz del Sol Sun, and the [[Korea Society]] in [[New York]] honored him with the [[James A. Van Fleet Award]] for his contributions to friendship between the United States and the Republic of Korea.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/news/news_detail.htm?No=39557|title=Samsung Chairman Lee Receives Van Fleet Award|date=[[2006]]-[[09-20]]|accessdate=2006-09-28|publisher=[http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/ KBS World]}}</ref>

In February 2006, Ban declared his candidacy to replace [[Kofi Annan]] as UN Secretary-General at the end of 2006, becoming the first South Korean to run for the office.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/nation/200602/kt2006021416334111990.htm|title=Minister Ban to Run for Top UN Job|author=Song-wu, Park|publisher=[[The Korea Times]]|accessdate=2006-09-28|date=[[2006]]-[[02-14]]}}</ref>  Though Ban was the first to announce a candidacy, he was not originally considered a serious contender.<ref name=FT10-10>{{Cite news | title = Relentless pursuit brings a challenge close to home; Profile Ban Ki-Moon | work = [[Financial Times]] | author = Anna Fifield | date = [[2006]]-[[10-10]]}}</ref>

Over the next eight months, Ban made ministerial visits to each of the 15 countries with a seat on the security council.<ref name=LAT10-09/>  In a field of seven candidates, he topped each of the four [[straw poll]]s conducted by the [[UN Security Council]] on [[July 24]],<ref>{{cite  web|url=http://www.unsg.org/wordpress/archives/115|title=Ban takes 1st Straw Poll|publisher=[http://www.unsg.org UNSG.org]|date=[[2006]]-[[07-24]]|accessdate=2006-09-28}}</ref> [[14 September]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unsg.org/wordpress/archives/138|title=Ban firms up lead in second Straw Poll|publisher=[http://www.unsg.org UNSG.org]|date=[[2006]]-[[09-14]]|accessdate=2006-09-28}}</ref> [[September 28]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unsg.org/wordpress/archives/164|title=Ban slips but holds, Vike Freiberga pushes into third|publisher=[http://www.unsg.org UNSG.org]|date=[[2006]]-[[09-28]]|accessdate=2006-09-28}}</ref> and [[October 2]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unsg.org/wordpress/archives/170|title=Ban Ki-moon wins|publisher=[http://www.unsg.org UNSG.org]|date=[[2006]]-[[10-02]]|accessdate=2006-10-02}}</ref> 

While these polls were being conducted, Ban made major speeches before the [[Asia Society]] and the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] in New York.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.asiasource.org/news/special_reports/kimoon.cfm | work = Asiasource.org | title = Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon interview | date = [[2006]]-[[09-26]] | accessdate = 2007-08-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.asiasociety.org/speeches/06ny_ban.html | date = [[2006]]-[[09-25]] | accessdate = 2007-08-02 | work = Ban Ki-moon address to Asia Society (transcript) | title = The Quest for Peace and Prosperity in the Asia-Pacific and Beyond}}</ref>  In order to be confirmed, Ban needed to not only win the support of the diplomatic community, but be able to avoid a veto from each of the five permanent members of the council<U+2014>[[People's Republic of China]], [[France]], [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]].  Ban was popular in Washington for having pushed to send South Korean troops to Iraq.  But Ban also opposed several U.S. interests: he expressed his support for the [[International Criminal Court]] and favored an entirely non-confrontational approach to dealing with North Korea.<ref name=LAT10-09/>  Ban said during the campaign that he would like to visit North Korea in person to meet with [[Kim Jong Il]] directly.<ref name="Newsweek"/>  Ban was viewed as a stark contrast from Kofi Annan, who was considered charismatic, but perceived as a weak manager because of problems surrounding the UN's oil-for-food program in Iraq.<ref name=Economist10-07/>

Ban also struggled to win the approval of France.  His official biography states that he speaks both [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], the two working languages of the UN Secretariat. He has repeatedly struggled to answer questions in French from journalists.<ref name=Phoney>{{citeweb|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/reportsfromabroad/herland/20061214.html|title=Is Ban Ki-moon a franco-phoney?|work = [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News]] | date = [[2006]]-[[12-14]] | accessdate = 2007-08-02}}</ref> Ban has repeatedly acknowledged his limitations at French, but assured French diplomats that he was devoted to continuing his study.  At a press conference on [[January 11]], [[2007]] Ban remarked, <U+201C>my French perhaps could be improved, and I am continuing to work. I have taken French lessons over the last few months. I think that, even if my French isn't perfect, I will continue to study it.<U+201D><ref>{{Cite web | url =  http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=2407 | work = [[United Nations]] | title = Secretary-General's press conference | date = [[2007]]-[[01-11]] | accessdate = 2007-08-02}}</ref>

As the Secretary-General election drew closer there was rising criticism of the South Korean campaign on Ban's behalf. Specifically, his alleged practice of systematically visiting all member states of the Security Council in his role as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade to secure votes in his support by signing trade deals with European countries and pledging [[foreign aid]] to [[developing countries]] were the focus of many news articles.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25689-2380336,00.html | title = Millions of dollars and a piano may put Korean in UN's top job | work = [[The Times]] | date = [[2006]]-[[09-26]] | accessdate = 2007-08-02}}</ref>  According to the ''[[Washington Post]],'' "rivals have privately grumbled that Republic of Korea, which has the world's 11th-largest economy, has wielded its economic might to generate support for his candidacy". Ban reportedly has said that these insinuations are "groundless". In an interview on [[17 September]], [[2006]] he stated: "As front-runner, I know that I can become a target of this very scrutinizing process" and "I am a man of integrity."<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/28/AR2006092801765.html | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = [[2006]]-[[09-28]] | accessdate = 2007-08-02 | title = S. Korean Contender for U.N. Post Has an Edge}}</ref>

In the final informal poll on October 2, Ban received fourteen favorable votes and one abstention ("no opinion") from the fifteen members of the Security Council (the polls were secret, and it is unknown which country abstained).  More importantly, Ban was the only one to escape a veto from the five permanent members; each of the other candidates received at least one "no" vote.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1104AP_UN_Next_Chief.html | title=Ban vows to reform U.N. if given top job|publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] | date=[[2006]]-[[10-03]] | accessdate=2006-10-09}}</ref>  After the vote, [[Shashi Tharoor]], who finished second, withdrew his candidacy<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/morenews/showmorestory.asp?id=94211|title=Shashi Tharoor pulls out of UN race|publisher=[http://www.ndtv.com/ NDTV.com]|date=[[2006]]-[[10-02]]|accessdate=2006-10-02}}</ref> and [[China|China's]] Permanent Representative to the UN told reporters that "it is quite clear from today's straw poll that Minister Ban Ki-moon is the candidate that the Security Council will recommend to the General Assembly."<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://webcast.un.org/ramgen/sc/so061002pm3.rm | title = United Nations Webcast of announcement | work = [[United Nations]] | accessdate = 2007-08-02}}</ref>

==Term as Secretary-General==
[[Image:Ban Ki-moon Bush.jpg|thumb|Ban Ki-moon with [[George W. Bush]].]]
When Ban became Secretary-General, ''[[The Economist]]'' listed the major challenges facing him in 2007: "rising nuclear demons in [[Iran]] and North Korea, a haemorrhaging wound in [[Darfur]], unending violence in the Middle East, looming environmental disaster, escalating international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the spread of HIV/AIDs.  And then the more parochial concerns, such as the largely unfinished business of the most sweeping attempt at reform in the UN's history."<ref name=Econ01-06/>  Before starting, Kofi Annan shared the story that when the first Secretary-General [[Trygve Lie]] left office he told his successor, [[Dag Hammarskjold]], "You are about to take over the most impossible job on earth."<ref name="Times10-14"/>

On [[January 1]], [[2007]] Ban took office as the eighth Secretary-General of the United Nations.  Ban's term as Secretary-General opened with a flap.  At his first encounter with the press as Secretary-General on [[2 January]], [[2007]], he refused to condemn the [[death penalty]] imposed on [[Saddam Hussein]] by the Iraqi High Tribunal, remarking that <U+201C>The issue of capital punishment is for each and every member State to decide.<U+201D> <ref>{{Cite web | url =  http://www.un.org/apps/sg/offthecuff.asp?nid=964 | work = [[United Nations]] | title = Secretary-General's encounter with the UN press corps (transcript)| date = [[2007]]-[[01-02]] | accessdate = 2007-08-02}}</ref>  Ban's statements contradicted long-standing United Nations opposition to the death penalty as a human rights concern.<ref name=NYT01-03>{{Cite news| title = New U.N.

In a statement through his spokesperson on [[6 January]], he <U+201C>strongly urged the Government of Iraq to grant a stay of execution to those whose death sentences may be carried out in the near future.<U+201D> <ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=2395 | title = Statement attributable to the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General on the death sentences in Iraq | work = [[United Nations]] | date = [[2007]]-[[01-06]] | accessdate = 2007-08-02}}</ref><ref name=FT02-01/> On the broader issue, he told a Washington, D.C., audience on [[January 16]], [[2007]] that he recognized and encouraged the <U+201C>growing trend in international society, international law and domestic policies and practices to phase out eventually the death penalty.<U+201D><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=2410 | title = Address at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and Q&A (transcript)| work = [[United Nations]] | date = [[2007]]-[[01-16]] | accessdate = 2007-08-02}}</ref>

===Cabinet===
In early January, Ban appointed the key members of his cabinet.  As his [[United Nations Deputy Secretary-General|Deputy Secretary-General]] he selected [[Tanzania]]n foreign minister and professor [[Asha-Rose Migiro]], a move that pleased African diplomats who had concerns of losing power without Annan in office.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Tanzanian Woman Is Chosen for U.N.'s 2nd Highest Post | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = [[2007]]-[[01-06]] | author = Julia Preston }}</ref>

The top position devoted exclusively to management, Under-Secretary-General for Management, was filled by [[Alicia B<U+00E1>rcena Ibarra]].  Ibarra was considered a UN insider, having previously served as Annan's chief of staff. Her appointment was seen by critics as an indication that Ban would not make dramatic changes to UN bureaucracy.<ref name=NYT01-04>{{Cite news | title = Mexican U.N. Insider Gets Manager's Post | date = [[2007]]-[[01-04]] | author = Julia Preston}}</ref>  Ban appointed [[John Holmes (British diplomat)|Sir John Holmes]], the British Ambassador to France, as [[Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator|Under-Secretary-General for humanitarian affairs and coordinator of emergency relief]].<ref name=NYT01-04/>

Ban initially said that he would delay making other appointments until his first round of reforms were approved, but he later backed away from this stance after receiving criticism.<ref name=NYT02-06/><ref name=FT02-01/>  In February he continued with appointments, selecting [[B. Lynn Pascoe]], the U.S. ambassador to Indonesia, to become Under-Secretary-General for political affairs.
[[Jean-Marie Gu<U+00E9>henno]], a French diplomat, who had served as Under-Secretary-General for peacekeeping operations under Annan remained in office.  Ban selected [[Vijay K. Nambiar]] as his chief of staff.<ref name=NYT02-10>{{Cite news | title = U.N. Chief Gives Key Post to American | author = [[Warren Hoge]] | date = [[2007]]-[[02-10]] | work = [[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

The appointment of many women to top jobs was seen as fulfilling a campaign promise Ban had made to increase the role of women in the United Nations.  During Ban's first year as Secretary-General more top jobs were being handled by women than ever before.  Though not appointed by Ban, the president of the General Assembly, [[Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa]] was a woman for only the third time in UN history.<ref name=CT04-11>{{Cite news | title = Leaders making world of difference\ Higher profile at UN brings new emphasis on issues affecting women | author = Stevenson Swanson | work = [[Chicago Tribune]] | date = [[2007]]-[[04-11]]}}</ref>

===Early reforms===
In his first month in office, Ban proposed two major restructurings: to split the UN peacekeeping operation into two departments and to combine the political affairs and disarmament department.  His proposals met with stiff resistance from members of the UN General Assembly, who bristled under Ban's request for rapid approval.  The proposed merge of the disarmament and political affairs offices was criticized by many in the developing world, partially because of rumors that Ban hoped to place American B. Lynn Pascoe in charge of the new office.  [[Alejandro D. Wolff]], then acting American ambassador, said the United States backed his proposals.<ref name=NYT02-06>{{Cite news | title = U.N.

After the early bout of reproach, Ban began extensive consultation with UN ambassadors, agreeing to have his peacekeeping proposal extensively vetted.  After the consultations, Ban dropped his proposal to combine political affairs and disarmament.<ref name=NYT02-19>{{Cite news | title = U.N. Chief Is Assuaging Doubts About Leadership | author = [[Warren Hoge]] | date = [[2007]]-[[02-19]] | work = [[The New York Times]]}}</ref>  Ban nevertheless pressed ahead with reforms on job requirements at the UN  requiring that all positions be considered five-year appointments, all receive strict annual performance reviews, and all financial disclosures be made public.  Though unpopular in the New York office, the move was popular in other UN offices around the world and lauded by UN observers.<ref name=NYT02-28>{{Cite news | title = New United Nations Chief Tackles the Agency's Tradition of Patronage Jobs | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = [[2007]]-[[02-28]] | author = [[Warren Hoge]]}}</ref>  Ban's proposal to split the peacekeeping operation into one group handling operations and another handling arms was finally adopted in mid March.<ref name=IrishTimes>{{Cite news | title = Ban Ki-moon learns the hard way | work = [[The Irish Times]] | author = Maggie Farley | date = [[2007]]-[[04-11]]}}</ref>

===Key issues===
The Secretary-General of the United Nations has the ability to influence debate on nearly any global issue.  Although unsuccessful in some areas, Ban's predecessor Annan had been successful in increasing the UN peacekeeping presence and in popularizing the [[Millennium Development Goals]].  UN observers were eager to see on which issues Ban intends to focus, in addition to reform of the United Nations bureaucracy.<ref name=Econ01-06/>

On several prominent issues, such as proliferation in Iran and North Korea, Ban has deferred to the Security Council.<ref name=IrishTimes/>  Ban has also declined to become involved on the issue of [[Taiwan]]'s status.  In 2007, the [[Republic of Nauru]], raised the issue of allowing the Republic of China (Taiwan) to sign the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]].  Ban referenced the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758]], and refused the motion.  On [[July 19]], [[2007]], the President of the Republic of China wrote to request admission into the UN by the name Taiwan.  Ban immediately rejected the request.<ref name=Taipei>{{Cite news | url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/07/30/2003371907 | title = MOFA spokesman slams Ban Ki-moon for rejecting UN bid | date = [[2007]]-[[07-30]] | accessdate = 2007-08-30 | work = [[Taipei Times]]}}</ref>

====Global warming====
[[Image:BUSHBANKI.jpg|thumb|President [[George W. Bush]] talks with [[United Nations Secretary-General]] Ban Ki-moon of the [[Republic of Korea]].  In their early meetings, Ban stressed the importance of confronting global warming.]]
Ban early on identified [[global warming]] as one of the key issues of his administration.  In a [[White House]] meeting with U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] in January, Ban urged Bush to take steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions.  On [[March 1]], [[2007]] in a speech before the UN General Assembly Hall, Ban further emphasized his concerns about global warming.  Ban stated, "For my generation, coming of age at the height of the Cold War, fear of nuclear winter seemed the leading existential threat on the horizon.  But the danger posed by war to all humanity<U+2014>and to our planet<U+2014>is at least matched by climate change."<ref name=Wash03-02>{{Cite news | title = U.N. Secretary General Calls Global Warming a Priority | author = Colum Lynch | date = [[2007]]-[[03-02]] | work = [[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>

====Middle East====
On Thursday, [[March 22]], [[2007]], while taking part in the first stop of a tour of the Middle East, a mortar attack hit just 80 meters from where the [[Secretary-General]] was standing, interrupting a press conference in [[Baghdad]]'s [[green zone]], and visibly shaking Ban and others.  No one was hurt in the [[incident]].<ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/23/content_5884102.htm Rocket blast shakes UN chief in Baghdad] Xinhua - 2007-03-23</ref>  The United Nations had already limited its role in Iraq after its Baghdad headquarters was bombed in August 2003, killing 22 people.  Ban said, however, that he still hoped to find a way for the United Nations to "do more for Iraqi social and political development."<ref name=NYT03-24>{{Cite news | title = U.N. Chief Isn't Discouraged by His Close Call in Iraq | author = [[Warren Hoge]] | date = [[2007]]-[[03-24]] | work = [[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

On his trip, Ban visited [[Egypt]], [[Israel]], the [[West Bank]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], where Ban attended a conference with leaders of the [[Arab League]] and met for several hours with [[Omar Hassan al-Bashir]], the Sudanese president who had resisted UN peacekeepers in Darfur.<ref name=IrishTimes/>  While Ban met with [[Mahmoud Abbas]], the Palestinian president, he declined to meet with [[Ismail Haniya]] of [[Hamas]].<ref name=NYT04-03>{{Cite news | title = On Mideast Trip, U.N. Chief Sought to Expand New Role | date = [[2007]]-[[04-03]] | author = [[Warren Hoge]] | work = [[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

====Darfur====
Ban took the first foreign trip of his term to attend the [[African Union]] summit in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]] in January 2007 as part of an effort to reach out to the [[Group of 77]].<ref name=Econ01-06>{{Cite news | title = Mission impossible? - The United Nations | date = [[2007]]-[[01-06]] | work = [[The Economist]]}}</ref>  He repeatedly identified Darfur as the top humanitarian priority of his administration.<ref name=IrishTimes/>  Ban played a large role, with several face-to-face meetings with Sudanese President [[Omar Hassan al-Bashir]], in convincing Sudan to allow UN peacekeepers to enter the Darfur region.  On [[July 31]], [[2007]] the United Nations Security Council approved sending 26,000 UN peacekeepers into the region to join 7,000 troops from the [[African Union]].  The resolution was heralded as a major breakthrough in confronting the [[Darfur conflict]] (although many countries have labeled the conflict a "[[genocide]]," the United Nations has declined to do so).  The first phase of the peacekeeping mission is expected to begin in October 2007.<ref name=NPR08-02>{{Cite news | title = United Nations Deploys Peacekeeping Troops to Darfur | author = Cheryl Corley | date = [[2007]]-[[08-02]] | work = [[Tell Me More]] on [[National Public Radio|NPR]]}}</ref>
