'''Crystal Palace Football Club''' is an English professional [[Association football|football]] [[Football team|club]] based in [[South Norwood]], London. During the [[2012<U+2013>13 Football League]] season, Palace finished fifth and gained promotion to the [[Premier League]] through the play-offs. Their colours are red and blue, although they had adopted a claret and pale blue strip of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in their early years and later played in white shirts inspired by Real Madrid. The club was founded at [[The Crystal Palace]] in 1905 to introduce a team to the local population, who regularly supported the [[FA Cup Final]] in sizeable numbers. Failing to gain election to [[The Football League]], Palace instead joined the [[Southern Football League]] Second Division, playing home games at The Crystal Palace, inspiration for the club's initial nickname, "The Glaziers". Palace won the Division and promotion in their first season, and played in the Southern League First Division for the next fifteen years.

In 1920 the Southern League Division One formed the [[Football League Third Division]]. Palace won the division and gained promotion to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], where they spent four seasons before suffering relegation to the [[Third Division South]]. In 1958 a league re-organisation saw Palace become founder members of [[Football League Fourth Division|Division Four]]. Over the next eleven years the club moved from the lowest rung of English Football to the highest, reaching the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in 1968. In 1973 the club modernised its image, changing the nickname from The Glaziers to "The Eagles" and ending the 68-year association with claret and blue by introducing the red-and-blue vertical stripes now associated with the club. The club stabilised itself in the top two divisions with successive promotions in 1977 and 1979. The period from 1989<U+2013>91 saw [[Steve Coppell]] guide the team to an FA Cup Final and third place in the First Division.  Palace became founder members of the Premier League in 1992, but were relegated the same season. Palace entered administration in both 2000 and 2010, and are now owned by a consortium of four. The club achieved promotion back to the Premier League under manager [[Ian Holloway]] with a 1<U+2013>0 win over [[Watford F.C.]] in the [[Football League play-offs]] of 2013.

Crystal Palace initially played their games in the grounds of The Crystal Palace, but the [[First World War]] saw them forced to move out, and they enjoyed a number of seasons at both the [[Herne Hill Velodrome]] and [[Croydon Common Athletic Ground|The Nest]]. Since [[1925<U+2013>26 in English football|1925]], Palace have played their home games at [[Selhurst Park]]. They have a fierce rivalry with [[M23 motorway|M23]] neighbours [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]], with whom they have contested the [[M23 derby]] 98 times. They also enjoy rivalries with fellow [[South London derby|South London teams]] [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]. The club's kit is currently made by Avec, a subsidiary of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], and the shirt sponsor is [[GAC Logistics]]. The club captain is [[Paddy McCarthy]] and the current player of the year is [[Mile Jedinak]]. [[Edmund Goodman]] is the club's longest serving manager, and [[Jim Cannon]] has made the most appearances for the club.  [[Peter Simpson (Scottish footballer)|Peter Simpson]] is the club's top scorer for both one season and overall, netting 54 and 165 respectively. The highest transfer fee received has been for [[Wilfried Zaha]] from [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in January 2013 and the highest paid has been to [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough]] for [[Dwight Gayle]] in July 2013.

==History==
{{main|History of Crystal Palace F.C.}}

[[File:Crystal Palace Year Book 1912-1913.jpg|thumb|right|The Crystal Palace F.C. Year Book for 1912<U+2013>13]]
The original [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] football club was an amateur team founded circa [[1860s in association football|1861]] and who competed in the first [[FA Cup 1871-72|FA Cup]], reaching the [[FA Cup Semi-finals|semi-finals]] where the team was eliminated by the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]]. The team disappear from historical records after a 3<U+2013>0 defeat to [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] in the second round of the 1875<U+2013>76 [[FA Cup]]. However, this was not the end of an association between Crystal Palace and the FA Cup.  In 1895 the FA adopted a new permanent home for the final, at [[The Crystal Palace]]. With the owners of the attraction reliant on tourist activity for their income, they sought fresh attractions for the venue, and it did not take long for the idea of forming their own team to play at the ground to occur.<ref>Matthews, p.&nbsp;11<U+2013>13</ref><ref>King p.9</ref>

The modern Crystal Palace Football Club, originally nicknamed "The Glaziers",  was formed on 10 September 1905 under the guidance of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] assistant secretary Edmund Goodman.<ref name="Business: Club History">{{citation | url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,10323~639642,00.html | title=Business: Club History | publisher=[[CPFC]]| accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref> The club applied to enter the [[Football League]] alongside [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], but was the only unsuccessful team of the three. The club instead found itself in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] Second Division for the [[1905<U+2013>06 Football League|1905<U+2013>06]] season. The club was successful in its inaugural season and was [[Promotion and relegation|promoted]] to the First Division, crowned as champions.<ref name="Business: Club History"/> In their first season Crystal Palace also played in the mid-week United Counties League, finishing runner-up to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], and it was in this competition that the club played their first match, winning 3<U+2013>0 away to [[New Brompton F.C.|New Brompton]].<ref name="Business: Club History"/><ref>King, p. 10</ref>

Palace remained in the Southern League up until 1914, their one highlight the [[Newcastle United F.C. 0<U+2013>1 Crystal Palace F.C. (1907)|1907 shock First Round victory]] over [[Newcastle United|Newcastle]] in the [[FA Cup]].<ref name=TOON>{{cite book|last=Hutchinson|first=Roger|title=The Toon: A Complete History of Newcastle United Football Club|year=2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-78057-314-4|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mGJsZeq7myAC&pg=PT20&lpg=PT20&dq=newcastle+crystal+palace+1907&source=bl&ots=W0Zojga18D&sig=yAD9saB6DPx6xumFSbUn2DRsPyY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WtzCUZuvAsLP0QX2lIHoBg&ved=0CFkQ6AEwCA}}</ref><ref name=GK>{{cite web|last=Porter|first=Steve|title=All time greatest F A cup giant killings  Number 11   Newcastle United 0-1 Crystal Palace|url=http://www.freewebs.com/captainbeecher/1907crystalpalace.htm|work=The Giant Killers|accessdate=20 June 2013|archiveurl=http://www.freewebs.com/captainbeecher/1907crystalpalace.htm|archivedate=20 June 2013}}</ref> The outbreak of World War I led to the [[Admiralty]] requisitioning The Crystal Palace and the club was forced to move to the home of [[West Norwood F.C.]], [[Herne Hill]].<ref name="Business: Club History"/> Three years later the club moved again to [[Croydon Common Athletic Ground|The Nest]] due to the folding of [[Croydon Common F.C.]] The club joined the [[Football League]] [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in the [[1920<U+2013>21 Football League|1920<U+2013>21 season]], finishing as champions and gaining promotion to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. Palace moved to the purpose-built stadium [[Selhurst Park]] in 1924, the ground the club plays at today.<ref name="Business: Club History"/><ref>King, pp.&nbsp;15<U+2013>19</ref>

The opening fixture at Selhurst Park was against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], Palace losing 0<U+2013>1 in front of a crowd of 25,000. Finishing 21st that season, the club was relegated to the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]]. Before [[World War II]] Palace made good efforts at promotion, never finishing outside the top half of the table and finishing second on three occasions. They were less successful after the war, their highest position being seventh, and conversely on three occasions the club had to apply for  [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]]. The club remained in Division Three South until [[1957<U+2013>58 in English football|1957<U+2013>58]]. A league reorganisation would see clubs in in the bottom half of the table merge with those in the bottom half of Division Three North to form a new [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]. Palace finished 14th <U+2013> just below the cut <U+2013> and found itself in the basement of English football. Their stay proved brief. With [[Arthur Rowe]] appointed manager, the [[1960<U+2013>61 in English football|1960<U+2013>61]] season saw Palace gain promotion. Although Rowe stepped down for health reasons, the promotion proved a turning point in the club's history. [[Dick Graham]] and then [[Bert Head]] guided the club to successive promotions in [[1963<U+2013>64 in English football|1963<U+2013>64]] and [[1968<U+2013>69 in English football|1968<U+2013>69]], taking the club through the Second Division and into the heights of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].<ref>King, pp.&nbsp;19<U+2013>20, 32<U+2013>7</ref>

Despite surviving in the top flight from 1969 until 1972, the club once again experienced great disappointment. Under the management of [[Malcolm Allison]] the club was relegated in consecutive seasons, finding itself back in Division Three for the [[1974<U+2013>75 in English football|1974<U+2013>75 season]]. It was under Allison that the club became nicknamed "The Eagles" and they enjoyed a run to the semi-final of the [[1975-76 FA Cup]], beating [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] along the way. Allison was sacked at the end of the 1975<U+2013>76 campaign, and it was under [[Terry Venables]]' management that Palace was promoted in [[1976<U+2013>77 in English football|1976<U+2013>77]] and again in [[1978<U+2013>79 in English football|1978<U+2013>79]] back up to the First Division. The club could not maintain their position in the top tier, however, and was relegated from the First Division in in [[1980<U+2013>81 in English football|1980<U+2013>81]], coinciding with [[Ron Noades]] takeover of the club. [[Steve Coppell]] arrived as manager  on 4 June 1984, and under his stewardship and rebuilding the club achieved promotion via the [[Football League play-offs|play-offs]] back to the First Division in [[1988<U+2013>89 in English football|1988<U+2013>89]]. The club followed this up by reaching the [[1990 FA Cup Final]], drawing 3<U+2013>3 with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the first match but losing the replay 1<U+2013>0. The club built on the success of the previous season in [[1990<U+2013>91 in English football|1990<U+2013>91]] by achieving its highest league finish of third and returning to Wembley to win the [[Full Members Cup|Zenith Data Systems Cup]]. The club beat [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] 4<U+2013>1 ([[extra time|after extra time]]) in the final, its only cup win to date.<ref name="Business: Club History"/> The following season saw star striker [[Ian Wright]] leave the club for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Palace finished tenth, allowing the club to become a founding member of the [[1992<U+2013>93 FA Premier League|FA Premier League]] in 1992<U+2013>93.<ref>King, p.&nbsp;39<U+2013>48</ref>

[[File:Selhurst Park, Holmesdale Road Stand - geograph.org.uk - 138710.jpg|thumb|The Holmesdale Road stand at Selhurst Park, constructed in 1994<U+2013>95.]]
The club sold [[Mark Bright]] to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] the following season, but failed to rebuild the squad adequately, and Palace struggled to score throughout the season.  The club found itself relegated with a record 49 points. Steve Coppell resigned and [[Alan Smith (manager)|Alan Smith]], his assistant at the club, took over. His first season saw the club win the First Division title and gain promotion to the Premier League.<ref>King, p. 48</ref> Their stay on this occasion proved eventful. On 25 January 1995 Palace played [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at Selhurst Park in which [[Eric Cantona]] was sent off. He was taunted by Palace fan Matthew Simmons,<ref>{{cite news|title=The Cantona affair: Palace offer Frenchman no sympathy|first=Martin|last=Whitfield|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/the-cantona-affair-palace-offer-frenchman-no-sympathy-1570043.html|work=The Independent|date=27 January 1995|accessdate=29 May 2013|archivedate=3 June 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6H6fPYXhX}}</ref> and retaliated with a flying kick.<ref>{{cite news|title=Soccer star attacks a fan|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DUNWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kuoDAAAAIBAJ&dq=crystal%20palace&pg=1390%2C6363284|date=27 January 1995|agency=The Associated Press|newspaper=The Gainesville Sun|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref> Cantona was sentenced to two weeks in jail,<ref>{{cite news|title=Jail term may make Cantona quit UK|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/jail-term-may-make-cantona-quit-uk-1612464.html|first=Steve|last=Boggan|date=24 March 1995|accessdate=29 May 2013|work=The Independent|archivedate=3 June 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6H6fW0Cet}}</ref> reduced to 120 hours [[community service]] on appeal.

Smith left the club and Steve Coppell returned as technical director in the summer of 1995, and through a combination of the first-team coaching of [[Ray Lewington]] and latterly [[Dave Bassett]]'s managership Palace reached the [[Football League play-offs|play-offs]]. Palace lost the [[1995 Football League First Division play-off Final|final]] in dramatic fashion, [[Steve Claridge]] scoring a last minute goal for [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] to win the tie 1<U+2013>0. The following season saw Coppell take charge as first-team manager when Dave Bassett departed for [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in early 1997<ref>{{cite news|title=Bassett quits Palace and joins Forest|agency=Reuters|work=The Nation|location=Bangkok|publisher=Nation Multimedia Group|date=1 March 1997|accessdate=1 August 2012|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dKZNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=s0MDAAAAIBAJ&dq=bassett%20nottingham%20forest%20manager&pg=6362%2C145781}}</ref> The club was successful in the play-offs at the second time of asking when the club defeated [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in the final at Wembley.<ref>King, pp.&nbsp;51<U+2013>2</ref>

This stay in the Premier League was no more successful than the previous two, and in true [[yo-yo club]] fashion the club was relegated back to the First Division for the [[1998<U+2013>99 in English football|1998<U+2013>99]] season. This season also saw the club plunged into [[Administration (insolvency)|administration]] when owner [[Mark Goldberg]] was unable to sustain his financial backing of the club.<ref name=BBC289590>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_company_file/289590.stm | title=The Company File: Palace on the rocks| date=3 March 1999|publisher=BBC News | accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref> The club emerged from administration under the ownership of [[Simon Jordan]], and Steve Coppell left the club, replaced by Alan Smith for a second time. The club flirted with relegation in Jordan's first season, [[2000-01 in English football|2000<U+2013>01]]. Smith was sacked in April and [[Steve Kember]] managed to win the two remaining fixtures that would guarantee survival, [[Dougie Freedman]] scoring the winner in a 1<U+2013>0 victory over [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport]] in the 87th minute on the final day of the season.

During the close season CPFC 2010, a consortium consisting of several wealthy fans successfully negotiated the purchase of the club. Led by [[Steve Parish (businessman)|Steve Parish]], the vocal representative for a consortium of four that included [[Jeremy Hosking]] and [[Martin Long]]. Crucially, CPFC 2010 also secured the freehold of the ground, the consortium paying tribute to a fans' campaign which helped pressure Lloyds Bank into selling the ground back to the club. The consortium swiftly installed [[George Burley]] as the Eagles' new manager.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/8745764.stm|title=Crystal Palace appoint George Burley as new boss|work=BBC Sport|date=17 June 2010}}</ref> However a poor start to the season saw the club hovering around the bottom of the table by December.

==Colours and crest==
When Crystal Palace were founded in 1905, they turned to one of the biggest clubs in the country at the time, [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], to seek advice. Villa helped the club in a number of ways, not least by donating their kit.<ref name=GNTSOTB>{{cite news|title=Nicking the shirts off their backs|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2005/nov/23/theknowledge.sport?INTCMP=SRCH|accessdate=27 June 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=23 November 2005|author=Georgina Turner|author2=James Dart|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6HhJ9PvUd|archivedate=27 June 2013}}</ref><ref name=RG1>{{cite book|last=Mitten|first=Andy|title=The Rough Guide to Cult Football|year=2010|publisher=Rough Guides UK|isbn=1-4053-8796-3}}</ref> As a result, Palace's colours were originally claret and blue shirts paired with white shorts, socks tending to be claret. They kept to this formula fairly consistently until 1938.  The 1937<U+2013>38 strip saw them try vertical stripes of claret and blue on the jersey rather than the claret body and blue sleeves, but then in 1938 they abandoned the claret and blue and adopted white shirts and black shorts with matching socks. Although they returned to claret and blue from 1949<U+2013>54, the 1955 season saw them return to white and black, now using claret and blue as trim.<ref name="HFK">{{cite web|title=Crystal Palace|work=Historical Football Kits|first=Dave|last=Moor|accessdate=1 August 2012|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Crystal_Palace/Crystal_Palace.htm}}</ref>

[[File:Crystal Palace General view from Water Temple.jpg|thumb|[[The Crystal Palace]], the fa<U+00E7>ade of which appears on the club crest.]]
Variations on this theme lasted until 1963 when the club adopted the lucky away strip of yellow jersey as the home colours. 1964 saw them adopt an all-white strip modelled on [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] whom the club had played recently in a friendly, before they returned to claret and blue jerseys with white shorts in 1966. The club employed variations upon this theme up until [[Malcolm Allison]]'s arrival as manager in 1973.<ref name="HFK"/> Allison overhauled the club's image, adopting red and blue horizontal stripes for colours and kit, inspired by [[Barcelona FC|Barcelona]].<ref name=GNTSOTB/> The club have played in variations of red and blue ever since, bar the centenary season of 2005 which saw them deploy a version of their 1971<U+2013>72 claret, blue and white kit.<ref name="HFK"/>

The club were relatively late in establishing a crest. Although the initials were embroidered onto the shirt from the 1935<U+2013>36 season, it wasn't until 1955 that a crest featuring the fa<U+00E7>ade of [[the Crystal Palace]] appeared. This crest disappeared from the shirt in 1964, and the team's name appeared embroidered on shirts in 1967<U+2013>72. 1972 saw a round badge adopted with the club's initials and nickname "The Glaziers" before Allison changed this too.<ref name="HFK"/> The nickname became "The Eagles", inspired by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] club [[SL Benfica|Benfica]], and the badge adopted an eagle holding a ball.<ref name="HFK"/> This emblem remained until 1987 when the club married the eagle with the Crystal Palace fa<U+00E7>ade,<ref>{{cite news|last=Elliott|first=Ken|title=Facelift for Crystal Palace's 'Benfica eagle'|url=http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/facelift-for-crystal-palaces-benfica-eagle-7593041.html|accessdate=27 June 2013|newspaper=Evening Standard|date=27 March 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6HhI4xKrQ|archivedate=27 June 2013}}</ref>  and although updated in 2006 and again in 2013 the crest retains these features.<ref name="HFK"/>

==Stadium==
{{Main|Selhurst Park}}
In 1905, the owners of the [[FA Cup Final]] venue, The Crystal Palace Company wanted a professional club to play there and tap into the crowd potential of the area. A new club, Crystal Palace F.C., was formed to use the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|ground]].<ref>King, p. 62</ref> When [[World War I]] broke out the Palace and grounds were seized by the military, and in 1915 the club were forced to move by [[The Admiralty]]. They found a temporary base at the [[Herne Hill Velodrome]].  Although other clubs had offered the use of their ground to Palace, the club felt it best to remain as close to their natural catchment area as possible.<ref>King, p. 63</ref> When [[Croydon Common F.C.|Croydon Common]] were wound up in 1917, the club took over their old stadium at [[The Nest (london football ground)|The Nest]],<ref>King, p. 64</ref> but in 1919 they began the purchase of the land on which they would build [[Selhurst Park]], their current home.<ref name="Matthews-p30,33-5">Matthews pp. 30, 33-5</ref>

[[Archibald Leitch]], the renowned stadium architect, was employed to draw up plans, and the club constructed and completed the ground in time for the [[1924-25 in English football|1924<U+2013>25 season]].<ref name="Matthews-p30,33-5" /> It remained relatively unchanged, with only the introduction of floodlights and maintenance and updating until 1969 when the Arthur Wait stand was constructed. The Main Stand became all-seater in 1979 and more work followed in the 1980s when the Whitehorse Lane End was redeveloped to allow for a [[Sainsbury's]] supermarket, club offices and a club shop. The Arthur Wait stand became all seater in 1990, and in 1994 the Holmesdale Terrace was redeveloped, replaced with a two tier Stand. Selhurst's attendance record was set in 1979, with an official total of 51,482.<ref>King p.&nbsp;67<U+2013>71</ref>  After all the redevelopments to the ground and safety requirements due to the [[Taylor Report]], the ground's current capacity is 26,309.<ref name=ESSPSF40>{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Simon|title=Crystal Palace: Selhurst Park set for a 40,000 makeover|url=http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/crystal-palace-selhurst-park-set-for-a-40000-makeover-8635930.html|accessdate=27 June 2013|newspaper=Evening Standard|date=29 May 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6HhChOXHm|archivedate=27 June 2013}}</ref> Proposals were put forward to move the club back to the Crystal Palace National Stadium in 2010,<ref>{{cite news|title=Crystal Palace unveil plans for National Sports Centre|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/9364649.stm|accessdate=27 June 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=20 January 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6HhCvqSHI|archivedate=27 June 2013}}</ref> but after the club gained promotion to the [[Premier League]] in 2013 there has been a renewed focus on redeveloping their current home into a 40,000 seater stadium.<ref name=ESSPSF40/><ref name=BBCLUX/>

==Supporters and rivalries==

Crystal Palace have a fan base drawn predominantly from the local area which draws on both [[South London]], [[Kent]] and [[Surrey]]. The club's original home, The Crystal Palace, was in the boundary of Kent, while Selhurst Park was within Surrey's borders until the<U+00A0>[[London Government Act 1963]] saw [[Greater London]] encompass [[Croydon]]. The fans have established at least two supporters groups. The Palace Independent Supporters Association was set up to raise supporter concerns with the club,<ref>{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://palace-isa.co.uk/about-us/|work=Palace Independent Supporters Association|accessdate=27 June 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Hh2BgmdZ|archivedate=27 June 2013}}</ref> while the Crystal Palace Supporters' Trust was originally established to enable fans to purchase the club during the administration of 2000.  The Trust remained in existence, and now lists one of its aims as building "a new state-of-the-art training ground to lease to the Club".<ref>{{cite web|title=What we do|url=http://palacetrust.org.uk/the-trust/what-we-do/|work=Crystal Palace Supporters' Trust|accessdate=27 June 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Hh25IwjO|archivedate=27 June 2013}}</ref>

A number of [[fanzines]] have been produced by the fans over the years.  ''Eagle Eye'' launched in 1987 and ran until 1994, with a number of contributors launching the replacement ''Palace Echo'' in 1995, running until 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Palace Echo |url=http://www.palace-echo.net/about.shtml |accessdate=15 July 2013}}</ref> ''The Eastern Eagles'', ''So Glad Your Mine'' and ''One More Point'' were also published by fans in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web | title=Football Fanzines<U+00A0>For<U+00A0>Sale<U+00A0>-<U+00A0>(Part 2 - Clubs From C - D) | url=http://home.clara.net/sjafn/fanzinesc_d.htm | accessdate=15 July 2013}}</ref> When ''One More Point'' ceased publication, ''Five Year Plan'' launched in its place,<ref>{{cite web|title=About FYP |url=http://www.fiveyearplanfanzine.co.uk/about-fyp.html |accessdate=15 July 2013}}</ref> and maintains an online presence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiveyearplanfanzine.co.uk/ | title=Five Year Plan | accessdate=15 July 2013}}</ref> Supporters also congregate on two [[internet forum]]s, The BBS and Holmesdale.net which the club use as channels to communicate with fans.<ref>{{cite web | format=PDF | title=Crystal Palace F.C.Fans<U+2019> Charter Season 2012/13 | url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/documents/fans-charter61-319328.pdf | accessdate=15 July 2012 | publisher=Crystal Palace Football Club }}</ref>

Foundation they work with local London boroughs of Croydon, Bromley and Sutton to provide sports and educational programmes. Through this work the club hope to develop their supporter base and geographical base.  The Foundation's work was recognised by The Football League in August 2009 with their Silver Standard Community Scheme Award.<ref>{{cite web|title=What We Do|url=http://cpfcfoundation.org/what-we-do/|work=Crystal Palace F.C.

Because of their location in the capital, Crystal Palace are involved in a number of local derbies, mostly across [[South London derby|South London]].  Their most prominent are with [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] and [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], with a smaller rivalry enjoyed with former tenants [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton]].<ref name="fancensus">{{cite web | url=http://www.footballfanscensus.com/issueresults/Club_Rivalries_Uncovered_Results.pdf | title=Derbies | publisher=FootballFansCensus| date=December 2003 | accessdate=2 August 2010| format=PDF}}</ref> The club's rivalry with Brighton, known as the [[M23 derby]], did not develop until Palace's relegation to the Third Division in 1974, reaching its height when the two teams were drawn together in the first round of the 1976<U+2013>77 FA Cup. The game went to two replays, but the controversy was based on referee Ron Challis ordering a successful Brighton penalty be retaken because of Palace player encroachment. The retake was saved, Palace won the game 1<U+2013>0 and a fierce rivalry was born.<ref>{{cite news|last=Burnton|first=Simon|title=How Brighton v Crystal Palace grew into an unlikely rivalry|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/football-league-blog/2011/sep/27/brighton-crystal-palace-rivalry|accessdate=26 June 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 September 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Hfnuq6Kd|archivedate=26 June 2013}}</ref>

==Ownership==
[[File:Sydney Bourne and Edmund Goodman circa 1906.jpg|right|thumb|200|First chairman [[Sydney Bourne]] with [[Edmund Goodman]], 1906.]]
Due to the [[Football League]] not wishing the owners of the [[FA Cup Final]] to also own a team, a separate company was established to found and own the team.  The first chairman, [[Sydney Bourne]], was found by club secretary [[Edmund Goodman]] after he had examined records of FA Cup Final ticket purchasers.  Goodman noted his name as one that had bought a number of tickets every year, and so he met with Bourne and found him very agreeable to the idea of the new club. Bourne was invited onto the board of directors and elected chairman at the club's first ever meeting. Bourne remained chairman until his death in 1930.<ref>King, pp.&nbsp;8<U+2013>23</ref>

[[Arthur Wait]] established a consortium of seven businessmen to purchase the club in 1949, and initially they rotated the chairmanship.<ref name="CA1">{{cite news | title=Behind-The-Scenes Shuffle At Palace | work=Croydon Advertiser | date=August, 1972 | author=Matthews, John|quote="...&nbsp;whose board he joined in 1948"}}</ref><ref name=CA3>"New Man Bloye Kills 'Moneybags' Tag", ''Croydon Advertiser'', Oct 27 1972, p.58"Twenty two years ago&nbsp;... seven men formed a board&nbsp;...

Noades eventually sold the club to [[Mark Goldberg]] on the 5 June 1998, becoming the second longest serving chairman behind Sydney Bourne. Goldberg's tenure of the club was not a success and the club entered administration in March 1999.  Although the fans established a group, The Crystal Palace Supporters Trust in a bid to gain control of the club, millionaire [[Simon Jordan]] negotiated a deal with creditors and the administrator, and a new company, CPFC 2000 took control. This company entered administration in January 2010, leaving administration in June of that year after a takeover by a consortium of four wealthy fans, CPFC 2010.<ref>King, pp.&nbsp;42<U+2013>60</ref>
