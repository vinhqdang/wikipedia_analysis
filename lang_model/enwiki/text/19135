'''Matthias Corvinus''', also called '''Matthias I''' ({{lang-hu|Hunyadi M<U+00E1>ty<U+00E1>s}}, {{lang-ro|Matia Corvin}}; 23 February 1443&nbsp;<U+2013> 6 April 1490), was [[King of Hungary]] and [[Croatia]] from 1458. After conducting several military campaigns, he was elected [[King of Bohemia]] in 1469 and adopted the title [[Duke of Austria]] in 1487. He was the son of [[John Hunyadi]], [[Regent of Hungary]], who died in 1456. In 1457, Matthias was imprisoned along with his older brother, [[Ladislaus Hunyadi]] on the orders of King [[Ladislaus the Posthumous|Ladislaus V of Hungary]]. Ladislaus Hunyadi was executed, causing a rebellion that forced King Ladislaus to flee Hungary. After the king died unexpectedly, Matthias's uncle [[Michael Szil<U+00E1>gyi]] persuaded the [[Estates of the realm|Estates]] to unanimously proclaim Matthias king on 24 January 1458. He began his rule under his uncle's guardianship, but he took control of government within two weeks.

As King, Matthias waged wars against the Czech mercenaries who dominated [[Upper Hungary]] (today parts of [[Slovakia]] and [[Northern Hungary]]) and against [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]], who claimed Hungary for himself. In this period, the [[Ottoman Empire]] conquered [[Serbia]] and [[Bosnia]], terminating the zone of [[buffer state]]s along the southern frontiers of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Matthias signed a peace treaty with Frederick III in 1463, acknowledging the Emperor's right to style himself King of Hungary. The Emperor returned the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]] with which Matthias was crowned on 29 April 1464. In this year, Matthias invaded the territories that had recently been occupied by the Ottomans and seized fortresses in Bosnia. He soon realized he could expect no substantial aid from the Christian powers and gave up his anti-Ottoman policy.

Matthias introduced new taxes and regularly collected extraordinary taxes. These measures caused a rebellion in [[Transylvania]] in 1467, but he subdued the rebels. The next year, Matthias declared war on [[George of Pod<U+011B>brady]], the [[Hussite]] King of Bohemia, and conquered [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], and [[Lausitz]] but he could not occupy [[Bohemia]] proper. The Catholic Estates proclaimed him King of Bohemia on 3 May 1469, but the Hussite lords refused to yield to him even after the death of George of Pod<U+011B>brady in 1471. Instead, they elected [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus Jagiellon]], the eldest son of [[Casimir IV of Poland]], king. A group of Hungarian prelates and lords offered the throne to Vladislaus's younger brother [[Saint Casimir|Casimir]] but Matthias overcame their rebellion. Having routed the united troops of Casimir IV and Vladislaus at [[Breslau]] (now Wroc<U+0142>aw in Poland) in late 1474, Matthias turned against the Ottomans, who had devastated the eastern parts of Hungary. He sent reinforcements to [[Stephen the Great]], [[Prince of Moldavia]], enabling Stephen to repel a series of Ottoman invasions in the late 1470s. In 1476, Matthias besieged and seized [[<U+0160>abac]], an important Ottoman border fort. He concluded a peace treaty with Vladislaus Jagiellon in 1478, confirming the division of the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] between them. Matthias waged a war against Emperor Frederick and occupied [[Lower Austria]] between 1482 and 1487.

He established a professional army{{mdash}}the [[Black Army of Hungary]], reformed the administration of justice, reduced the power of the barons, and promoted the careers of talented individuals chosen for their abilities rather than their social statuses. Matthias patronized art and science; his royal library, the ''[[Bibliotheca Corviniana]]'', was one of the largest collections of books in Europe. With his patronage, Hungary became the first country to embrace the [[Renaissance]] from Italy. As Matthias the Just, the monarch who wandered among his subjects in disguise, he remains a popular hero of Hungarian folk tales.

===Childhood (1443<U+2013>1457)===

[[File:Ioan de Hunedoara.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=John Hunyadi |Matthias's father, [[John Hunyadi]]]]

Matthias was born in Kolozsv<U+00E1>r (now [[Cluj-Napoca]] in Romania) on 23 February 1443.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=23}} He was the second son of [[John Hunyadi]] and his wife, [[Erzs<U+00E9>bet Szil<U+00E1>gyi (noblewoman)|Elisabeth Szil<U+00E1>gyi]].{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=23}}{{sfn|Mure<U+015F>anu|2001|p=49}} John Hunyadi was a pre-eminent military commander and political leader of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], who spent most of his life away from the family estates. Because of his father's absence, Matthias's education was tasked to his mother.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=23}} Many of the most learned men of Central Europe{{mdash}}including [[Gregory of Sanok]] and [[J<U+00E1>nos Vit<U+00E9>z (bishop)|John Vit<U+00E9>z]]{{mdash}}frequented John Hunyadi's court when Matthias was a child.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|pp=27<U+2013>28}} Gregory of Sanok, a former tutor of King [[Vladislaus III of Poland]], was Matthias's only teacher whose name is known.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=24}} Under these scholars' influences, Matthias became an enthusiastic supporter of [[Renaissance humanism]].{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=161}}{{sfn|Klaniczay|1992|p=165}}

As a child, Matthias learnt many languages and read [[classical literature]], especially military treatises.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=24}} According to [[Antonio Bonfini]], Matthias "was well versed in all the tongues of Europe", with the exceptions of [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=28}} Although this was an exaggeration, it is without doubt that Matthias spoke [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Latin language|Latin]], Italian, [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Czech language|Czech]], and German.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=24}}{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=28}}

[[File:Ladislas the Posthumous 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Ladislaus V |[[Ladislaus the Posthumous]], [[King of Hungary]] and [[King of Bohemia|Bohemia]], and [[Duke of Austria]]]]

According to a treaty between John Hunyadi and [[<U+0110>or<U+0111>e Brankovi<U+0107>]], [[Despot of Serbia]], Matthias and the Despot's granddaughter [[Elizabeth of Celje]] were engaged on 7 August 1451.{{sfn|Mure<U+015F>anu|2001|p=174}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=292}} Elizabeth was the daughter of [[Ulrich II, Count of Celje]], who was related to King [[Ladislaus the Posthumous|Ladislaus V of Hungary]] and an opponent of Matthias's father.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=25}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=290<U+2013>292}} Because of new conflicts between Hunyadi and Ulrich of Celje, the marriage of their children only took place in 1455.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=25<U+2013>26}} Elizabeth settled in the [[Hunyadi family|Hunyadis]]' estates but Matthias was soon sent to the royal court, implying that their marriage was a hidden change of hostages between their families.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=25}} Elizabeth died before the end of 1455.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=25}}

John Hunyadi died on 11 August 1456, less than three weeks after [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|his greatest victory]] over the [[Ottomans]] in [[Belgrade]].{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=280, 296}} John's elder son{{mdash}}Matthias's brother{{mdash}}[[Ladislaus Hunyadi|Ladislaus]] became the head of the family.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=25}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=296}} John's conflict with Ulrich of Celje ended with Ulrich's capture and assassination on 9 November.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=569}}{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=61}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=26}} Under duress, the King promised he would never take his revenge against the Hunyadis for Ulrich's killing.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=297}} However, the murder turned most barons{{mdash}}including [[Palatine of Hungary|Palatine]] [[Ladislaus II Garai|Ladislaus Garai]], [[Judge royal]] Ladislaus P<U+00E1>l<U+00F3>ci, and [[Nicholas of Ilok|Nicholas <U+00DA>jlaki]], [[Voivode of Transylvania]]{{mdash}}against Ladislaus Hunyadi.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=297}} Taking advantage of their resentment, the King had the Hunyadi brothers imprisoned in Buda on 14 March 1457.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=61}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=27}} The royal council condemned them to death for high treason and Ladislaus Hunyadi was beheaded on 16 March.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=49}}

Matthias was held in captivity in a small house in Buda.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=297}}{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=50}} His mother and her brother [[Michael Szil<U+00E1>gyi]] staged a rebellion against the King and occupied large territories in the regions to the east of the river [[Tisza]].{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=297}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=27}} King Ladislaus fled to [[Vienna]] in mid-1457, and from Vienna to [[Prague]] in September, taking Matthias with him.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=61}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=28}}{{sfn|E. Kov<U+00E1>cs|1990|p=30}} The civil war between the rebels and the barons loyal to the monarch continued until the sudden death of the young King on 23 November 1457.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=297}} Hereafter the [[Hussite]] Regent of Bohemia{{mdash}}[[George of Pod<U+011B>brady]]{{mdash}}held Matthias captive.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=30}}

===Election as king (1457<U+2013>1458)===

Ladislaus V died childless in 1457.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=29}}{{sfn|Maga<U+0161>|2007|p=75}} His elder sister [[Anne of Austria, Landgravine of Thuringia|Anna]] and her husband, [[William III, Landgrave of Thuringia]] laid claim to his inheritance but received no support from the [[Estates of the realm|Estates]].{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=29}} The [[Diet of Hungary]] was convoked to Pest to elect a new king in January 1458.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=298}} [[Pope Calixtus III]]'s [[papal legate|legate]] [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Juan Carvajal]], who had been John Hunyadi's admirer, began openly campaigning for Matthias.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=298}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=31}}

The election of Matthias as king was the only way of avoiding a protracted civil war.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=298}} Ladislaus Garai was the first baron to yield.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=31}} At a meeting with Matthias's mother and uncle, he promised that he and his allies would promote Matthias's election, and Michael Szil<U+00E1>gyi promised that his nephew would never seek vengeance for Ladislaus Hunyadi's execution.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=298}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=31}} They also agreed that Matthias would marry the Palatine's daughter Anna{{mdash}}his executed brother's bride.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=298}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=31}}

Michael Szil<U+00E1>gyi arrived at the Diet with 15,000 troops, intimidating the barons who assembled in Buda.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=61}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=298}} Stirred up by Szil<U+00E1>gyi, the noblemen gathered on the frozen River Danube and unanimously proclaimed the 14-year-old Matthias King on 24 January.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=298}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=31<U+2013>32}}{{sfn|Bartl|<U+010C>i<U+010D>aj|Koh<U+00FA>tova|Letz|2002|p=51}} At the same time, the Diet elected his uncle as regent.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=31}}{{sfn|Bartl|<U+010C>i<U+010D>aj|Koh<U+00FA>tova|Letz|2002|p=51}}

Matthias's election was the first time that a member of the nobility mounted the royal throne in Hungary.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=50}} Michael Szil<U+00E1>gyi sent John Vit<U+00E9>z to Prague to discuss the terms of Matthias's release with George of Pod<U+011B>brady.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=54}} Pod<U+011B>brady{{mdash}}whose daughter [[Catherine of Pod<U+011B>brady|Kunigunda]] Matthias promised to marry{{mdash}}agreed to release his future son-in-law for a ransom of 60,000 gold florins.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=53<U+2013>54}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=299}} Matthias was surrendered to the Hungarian delegates in [[Str<U+00E1><U+017E>nice (Hodon<U+00ED>n District)|Str<U+00E1><U+017E>nice]] on 9 February.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=54}} With Pod<U+011B>brady's mediation, he was reconciled with [[John Jiskra of Brand<U+00FD>s]], the commander of the Czech mercenaries who dominated most of [[Upper Hungary]].{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=57}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=300}}

Matthias made his state entry into Buda five days later.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=55}}{{sfn|E. Kov<U+00E1>cs|1990|p=32}} He ceremoniously sat on the throne in the Church of Our Lady, but was not crowned, because the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]] had been in the possession of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]] for almost two decades.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=55}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=282, 299}} The 14-year-old monarch administered state affairs independently from the outset, although he reaffirmed his uncle's position as Regent.{{sfn|E. Kov<U+00E1>cs|1990|p=33}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=56}} For instance, Matthias instructed the citizens of Nagyszeben (now [[Sibiu]] in Romania) to reconcile their differences with [[Vlad Dracula]], [[Prince of Wallachia]] on 3 March.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=56}}

Jiskra was the first baron who turned against Matthias.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=57}} He offered the throne to [[Casimir IV of Poland]]{{mdash}}the husband of King Ladislaus V's younger sister [[Elisabeth of Habsburg (1436<U+2013>1505)|Elisabeth]]{{mdash}}in late March but the [[General sejm]] of Poland rejected his offer.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=57}} Matthias's commander Sebastian Rozgonyi defeated Jiskra's soldiers at [[S<U+00E1>rospatak]] but the Ottomans' invasion of [[Serbia]] in April forced Matthias to conclude an armistice with the Czechs.{{sfn|Bartl|<U+010C>i<U+010D>aj|Koh<U+00FA>tova|Letz|2002|p=51}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=57<U+2013>58}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=573}} They were allowed to preserve S<U+00E1>ros Castle ([[<U+0160>ari<U+0161> Castle]], Slovakia) and other fortified places in Upper Hungary.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=58}} Matthias sent two prelates{{mdash}}August Sal<U+00E1>nki, [[Bishop of Gy<U+0151>r]], and Vincent Szilasi, [[Bishop of V<U+00E1>c]]{{mdash}}to Prague to crown George of Pod<U+011B>brady king.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=57}} Upon their demand, the "heretic" Pod<U+011B>brady swore loyalty to the [[Holy See]].{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=57}}

[[File:Matthias Corvinus florint 755272.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Matthias's golden florin |Matthias's golden florin depicting [[Madonna and Child]], and [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|King Saint Ladislaus]]]]

Matthias's first Diet assembled in Pest in May 1458.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=315}} The Estates passed almost 50 decrees that were ratified by Matthias{{mdash}}instead of the Regent{{mdash}}on 8 June.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=60}} One decree prescribed that the King "must call and hold, and order to be held, a diet of all the gentlemen of the realm in person"{{sfn|Bak|Domonkos|Harvey|Garay|1996|p=7}} every year on [[Whitsun]]day.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=315}} Matthias held more than 25 Diets during his reign and convoked the Estates more frequently than his predecessors, especially between 1458 and 1476.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=315}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=125<U+2013>126}}{{sfn|E. Kov<U+00E1>cs|1990|p=51}} The Diets were controlled by the barons, whom Matthias appointed and dismissed at will.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=315}}{{sfn|E. Kov<U+00E1>cs|1990|p=49}} For instance, he dismissed Palatine Ladislaus Garai and persuaded Michael Szil<U+00E1>gyi to resign from the Regency after they entered into a league in the summer of 1458.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=61}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=299}} The King appointed [[Michael Orsz<U+00E1>g]], who had been his father's close supporter, as the new Palatine.{{sfn|Mark<U+00F3>|2006|p=244}} Most of Matthias's barons were descended from old aristocratic families but he also promoted the careers of members of the lesser nobility, or even of skilful commoners.{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=311<U+2013>313}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=122, 181}} For instance, the noble [[House of Z<U+00E1>polya|Z<U+00E1>polya]] brothers [[Emeric Z<U+00E1>polya|Emeric]] and [[Stephen Z<U+00E1>polya|Stephen]] owed their fortunes to Matthias's favour.{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=311<U+2013>312}}

Matthias's ordinary revenues amounted around 250,000 golden florins per year when his reign began.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=63}} A decree passed at the Diet of 1458 explicitly prohibited the imposition of extraordinary taxes.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=67}} However, an extraordinary tax{{mdash}}[[Hungarian forint#History|one golden florin]] per each ''porta'' or peasant household{{mdash}}was levied late that year.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=67}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=310<U+2013>311}} The Ottomans occupied the fort of [[Golubac]] in Serbia in August 1458; Matthias ordered the mobilization of all noblemen.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=574}}{{sfn|Bartl|<U+010C>i<U+010D>aj|Koh<U+00FA>tova|Letz|2002|p=51}} He made a raid into Ottoman territory and defeated the enemy forces in minor skirmishes.{{sfn|Bartl|<U+010C>i<U+010D>aj|Koh<U+00FA>tova|Letz|2002|p=51}} King [[Stephen Thomas of Bosnia]] accepted Matthias's suzerainty.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=574}} He authorized his new [[vassal]]'s son [[Stephen Toma<U+0161>evi<U+0107> of Bosnia|Stephen Toma<U+0161>evi<U+0107>]] to take possession of the parts of Serbia that had not been occupied by the Ottomans.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=574}}

Matthias dismissed his Chief Chancellor Archbishop Sz<U+00E9>csi, replacing him with [[Stephen V<U+00E1>rdai]], [[Archbishop of Kalocsa]], and John Vit<U+00E9>z.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=302}} Both prelates bore the title of Chief and Secret Chancellor, but V<U+00E1>rdai was the actual leader of the [[Chancery (medieval office)|Royal Chancery]].{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=74}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2004|p=29}} Around the same time, Matthias united the superior courts of justice{{mdash}}the [[Court of Royal Special Presence]] and the [[Court of Personal Presence]]{{mdash}}into one supreme court.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=302}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=75<U+2013>76}} The new supreme court diminished the authority of the traditional courts presided over by the barons and contributed to the professionalization of the administration of justice.{{sfn|Bak|1994|p=73}} He appointed [[Albert Hang<U+00E1>csi]], [[Bishop of Csan<U+00E1>d]] as the first [[Chief Justice of Hungary|Chief Justice]].{{sfn|Kubinyi|2004|p=32}}{{sfn|B<U+00F3>nis|1971|p=vi}}

Sultan Mehmed II returned to Bosnia and laid siege to Jajce in July 1464.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=586}}{{sfn|Babinger|1978|p=231}} Matthias began assembling his troops along the river [[Sz<U+00E1>va]], forcing the Sultan to raise the siege on 24 August.{{sfn|Babinger|1978|p=231}} Matthias and his army crossed the river and seized [[Srebrnica]].{{sfn|Babinger|1978|pp=231<U+2013>232}} He also besieged [[Zvornik]] but the arrival of a large Ottoman army forced him to withdraw to Hungary.{{sfn|Babinger|1978|p=232}} The following year, Matthias forced Stefan Vuk<U+010D>i<U+0107>, who had transferred Makarska Krajina to the [[Republic of Venice]], to establish Hungarian garrisons in his forts along the river [[Neretva]].{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=586<U+2013>587}}

D<U+00E9>nes Sz<U+00E9>csi died in 1465 and John Vit<U+00E9>z became the new Archbishop of Esztergom.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=80}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=449}} Matthias replaced the two Voivodes of Transylvania{{mdash}}Nicholas <U+00DA>jlaki and John Pongr<U+00E1>c of Dengeleg{{mdash}}with Counts [[Szentgy<U+00F6>rgyi#Notable members of the family|Sigismund]] and John Szentgy<U+00F6>rgyi, and [[Bertold Ellerbach]].{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=81}} Although <U+00DA>jlaki preserved his office of [[Ban of Macs<U+00F3>]], the King appointed Peter Szokoli to administer the province together with the old Ban.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=82}}

Matthias convoked the Diet to make preparations for an anti-Ottoman campaign in 1466.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=82}} For the same purpose, he received subsidies from [[Pope Paul II]].{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=81<U+2013>82}}{{sfn|E.

Matthias visited [[Slavonia]] and dismissed the two [[Ban of Slavonia|Bans]] Nicholas <U+00DA>jlaki and Emeric Z<U+00E1>polya, replacing them with Jan Vitovec and John Tuz in 1466.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=81}} Early the following year, he mounted a campaign in Upper Hungary against a band of Czech mercenaries who were under the command of J<U+00E1>n <U+0160>vehla and had seized Kosztol<U+00E1>ny ([[Ve<U+013E>k<U+00E9> Kosto<U+013E>any]] in Slovakia).{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=59}}{{sfn|Bartl|<U+010C>i<U+010D>aj|Koh<U+00FA>tova|Letz|2002|p=53}} Matthias routed them and had <U+0160>vehla and his 150 comrades hanged.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=59}}{{sfn|Bartl|<U+010C>i<U+010D>aj|Koh<U+00FA>tova|Letz|2002|p=52}}

At the Diet of March 1467, two traditional taxes were renamed; the [[chamber's profit]] was thereafter collected as [[tax of the royal treasury]] and the [[thirtieth (tax)|thirtieth]] as the [[Crown's customs]].{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=310}} Because of this change, all previous tax exemptions became void, increasing state revenues.{{sfn|Bartl|<U+010C>i<U+010D>aj|Koh<U+00FA>tova|Letz|2002|p=52}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=77<U+2013>78}} Matthias set about centralizing the administration of royal revenues.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=76}} He entrusted the administration of the Crown's customs to John Ernuszt, a converted Jewish merchant.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=76}} Within two years, Ernuszt was responsible for the collection of all ordinary and extraordinary taxes, and the management of the salt mines.{{sfn|E.

The Diet of 1468 authorized Matthias to levy an extraordinary tax to finance the new war, but only after 8 prelates and 13 secular lords pledged on the King's behalf that he would not demand such charges in the future.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=88}} Matthias also exercised [[royal prerogative]]s to increase his revenues.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=88}} For instance, he ordered a Palatine's [[eyre (legal term)|eyre]] in a county, the cost of which were to be covered by the local inhabitants but soon authorized the county to redeem the cancellation of this irksome duty.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=88}}

The Czech Catholics, who were led by [[Zden<U+011B>k of <U+0160>ternberk]], joined forces with Matthias in February 1469.{{sfn|E.

Matthias participated in the lengthy [[Palm Sunday]] ceremony in Vienna in 1490, although he had felt so ill that morning that he could not eat breakfast.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=149}}{{sfn|E. Kov<U+00E1>cs|1990|p=187}} Around noon, he tasted a fig that proved to be rotten and he became very agitated and suddenly felt faint.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=150}} The next day he was unable to speak.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=150}} After two days of suffering, Matthias died in the morning of 6 April.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=150}}{{sfn|E.

Matthias was the first non-Italian monarch promoting the spread of Renaissance style in his realm,{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=161}}{{sfn|Klaniczay|1992|p=165}} His marriage to Beatrice of Naples strengthened the influence of contemporaneous Italian art and scholarship.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=67}} and it was under his reign that Hungary became the first land outside Italy to embrace the Renaissance.{{sfn|Waldman|Farbaky|2011|p=Abstract}} The earliest appearance of Renaissance style buildings and works outside Italy was in Hungary.{{sfn|Johnson|2007|p=175}}{{sfn|Kaufmann|1995|p=30}} The Italian scholar [[Marsilio Ficino]] introduced Matthias to [[Plato]]'s ideas of a [[philosopher-king]] uniting wisdom and strength in himself, which fascinated Matthias.{{sfn|Cacioppe|2007}} Matthias is the main character in [[Aurelio Lippo Brandolini]]'s ''Republics and Kingdoms Compared'', a dialogue on the comparison of the two forms of government.{{sfn|Rubinstein|1991|p=35}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=164}} According to Brandolini, Matthias said a monarch "is at the head of the law and rules over it" when summing up his own concepts of state.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=164}}

Matthias also cultivated traditional art.{{sfn|Klaniczay|1992|p=173}} Hungarian epic poems and lyric songs were often sung at his court.{{sfn|Klaniczay|1992|p=173}} He was proud of his role as the defender of Roman Catholicism against the Ottomans and the Hussites.{{sfn|Klaniczay|1992|p=168}} He initiated theological debates, for instance on the doctrine of the [[Immaculate Conception]], and surpassed both the Pope and his legate "with regard to religious observance", according to the latter.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=99}} Matthias issued coins in the 1460s bearing an image of the [[Virgin Mary]], demonstrating his special devotion to her cult.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=184}}

Upon Matthias's initiative, Archbishop John Vit<U+00E9>z and Bishop Janus Pannonius persuaded Pope Paul II to authorize them to set up a university in [[Pressburg]] (now [[Bratislava]] in Slovakia) on 29 May 1465.{{sfn|E. Kov<U+00E1>cs|1990|p=182}}{{sfn|Bartl|<U+010C>i<U+010D>aj|Koh<U+00FA>tova|Letz|2002|p=52}} The ''[[Academia Istropolitana]]'' was closed shortly after the Archbishop's death.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=169}}{{sfn|Bak|1994|p=75}} Matthias was contemplating establishing a new university in Buda but this plan was not accomplished.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=169}}

===Building projects===

[[File:M<U+00E1>ty<U+00E1>s budai v<U+00E1>ra.jpg|thumb|right||The Royal Palace in [[Buda]], engraving from the 1480s]]

Matthias started at least two major building projects.{{sfn|E. Kov<U+00E1>cs|1990|pp=177, 180<U+2013>181}} The works in Buda and [[Visegr<U+00E1>d]] began in about 1479.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=319}} Two new wings and a [[hanging garden]] were built at the royal castle of Buda, and the palace at Visegr<U+00E1>d was rebuilt in Renaissance style.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=319}}{{sfn|E. Kov<U+00E1>cs|1990|pp=180<U+2013>181}} Matthias appointed the Italian [[Chimenti Camicia]] and the Dalmatian [[Giovanni Dalmata]] to direct these projects.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=319}}
[[File:Visegrad 1480 korul.jpg|thumb|left|190px|The Renaissance palaces of the summer residence at [[Visegr<U+00E1>d]], engraving from the 1480s]]
Matthias commissioned the leading Italian artists of his age to embellish his palaces: for instance, the sculptor [[Benedetto da Majano]] and the painters [[Filippino Lippi]] and [[Andrea Mantegna]] worked for him.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=171<U+2013>172}} A copy of Mantegna's portrait of Matthias survived.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=172}} Matthias also hired the Italian military engineer [[Aristotele Fioravanti]] to direct the rebuilding of the forts along the southern frontier.{{sfn|E. Kov<U+00E1>cs|1990|p=181}} He had new monasteries built in [[Late Gothic]] style for the [[Franciscans]] in Kolozsv<U+00E1>r, [[Szeged]] and Hunyad, and for the [[Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit|Paulines]] in Fej<U+00E9>regyh<U+00E1>za.{{sfn|Klaniczay|1992|p=168}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=183}}

===Royal library===
{{Main|Bibliotheca Corviniana}}

Matthias started the systematic collection of books after the arrival of his first librarian, [[Galeotto Marzio]], a friend of Janus Pannonius from [[Ferrara]] in around 1465.{{sfn|E. Kov<U+00E1>cs|1990|pp=183<U+2013>184}}{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=52}} The exchange of letters between [[Taddeo Ugoleto]], who succeeded Marzio in 1471, and Francesco Bandini contributed to the development of the royal library because the latter regularly informed his friend of new manuscripts.{{sfn|E. Kov<U+00E1>cs|1990|pp=183<U+2013>184}} Matthias also employed scriptors, illuminators, and book-binders.{{sfn|Klaniczay|1992|pp=166<U+2013>167}} Although the exact number of his books is unknown, his ''[[Bibliotheca Corviniana]]'' was one of Europe's largest collections of books when he died.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|pp=8<U+2013>10}}

According to Marcus Tanne, the surviving 216 volumes of the King's library "show that Matthias had the literary tastes of a classic 'alpha male'{{sp}}", who preferred secular books to devotional works.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=7}} For instance, a Latin translation of [[Xenophon]]'s [[Cyropaedia|biography of Cyrus the Great]], [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]]'s book of [[Alexander the Great]], and a military treatise by the contemporaneous [[Roberto Valturio]] survived.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=7}} Matthias enjoyed reading, as demonstrated by a letter in which he thanked the Italian scholar [[Pomponio Leto]] who had sent him [[Silius Italicus]]'s [[Punica (poem)|work of the Second Punic War]].{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=7}}

===Patron of scholars===

Matthias enjoyed the company of Humanists and had lively discussions on various topics with them.{{sfn|Klaniczay|1992|p=166}} The fame of his magnanimity encouraged many scholars{{mdash}}mostly Italian{{mdash}}to settle in Buda.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=67}} Antonio Bonfini, [[Pietro Ranzano]], [[Bartolomeo Fonzio]], and [[Francesco Bandini]] spent many years in Matthias's court.{{sfn|E. Kov<U+00E1>cs|1990|p=185}}{{sfn|Klaniczay|1992|p=166}} This circle of educated men introduced the ideas of [[Neo-Platonism]] to Hungary.{{sfn|Klaniczay|1992|p=167}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=321}}

Like all intellectuals of his age, Matthias was convinced that the movements and combinations of the stars and planets exercised influence on individuals' life and on the history of nations.{{sfn|Hendrix|2013|p=59}} Galeotto Marzio described him as "king and astrologer", and Antonio Bonfini said Matthias "never did anything without consulting the stars".{{sfn|Hendrix|2013|pp=63, 65}} Upon his request, the famous astronomers of the age, [[Johannes Regiomontanus]] and [[Marcin Bylica]], set up an observatory in Buda and installed it with [[astrolabe]]s and [[celestial globe]]s.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=99}} Regiomontanus dedicated his book on navigation that was used by [[Christopher Columbus]] to Matthias.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=67}} The King appointed Bylica as his advisor in 1468.{{sfn|Hendrix|2013|p=57}} According to Scott E. Hendrix, "establishing a prominent astrologer as his political advisor provided an anxiety-reduction mechanism that boosted morale for the political elites within his realm while strengthening his sense of control in the face of the multiple adversities the Hungarians faced" in his reign.{{sfn|Hendrix|2013|p=58}}

Matthias's first wife Elizabeth of Celje was a child when their marriage took place in 1455.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=25}} She died in September before the marriage was consummated.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=25}}{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=48}} His second wife Catherine of Pod<U+011B>brady was born in 1449.{{sfn|E. Kov<U+00E1>cs|1990|p=26}} She died in childbirth in January or February 1464.{{sfn|E. Kov<U+00E1>cs|1990|p=26}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=67}} The child did not survive.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=67}}

Matthias approached Emperor Frederick to suggest a new bride for him among Frederick's relatives.{{sfn|E. Kov<U+00E1>cs|1990|p=161}} [[Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg]] proposed one of his daughters to Matthias but the Hungarian Estates opposed this plan.{{sfn|E. Kov<U+00E1>cs|1990|p=161}} In an attempt to enter into an alliance with King Casimir IV of Poland, Matthias proposed to the King's daughter [[Hedwig Jagiellon, Duchess of Bavaria|Hedvig]] but he was refused.{{sfn|E. Kov<U+00E1>cs|1990|p=105}}{{sfn|Teke|1981|p=290}} During the 1470 meeting of Emperor Frederick and Matthias, a marriage between Matthias and the Emperor's five-year-old daughter [[Kunigunde of Austria]] was also discussed, but the Emperor was not willing to commit himself to the marriage.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=78}}

Matthias's third wife Beatrice of Naples was born in 1457.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=80}} Their engagement was announced in Breslau on 30 October 1474, during the siege of the town by Casimir IV and Vladislaus Jagiellon.{{sfn|Teke|1981|p=296}} Her dowry amounted to 200,000 gold pieces.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=88}} Beatrice survived her husband and returned to Naples where she died in 1508.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=150}}

Matthias's only known child John Corvinus was born out of wedlock in 1473.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=134}}{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=94}} His mother [[Barbara Edelp<U+00F6>ck]]{{mdash}}the daughter of a citizen of Stein in Lower Austria{{mdash}}met the King in early 1470.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=134}} John Corvinus died on 12 October 1504.{{sfn|E.

According to Marcus Tanner, Matthias ruled "a European superpower" at the end of his reign.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=xi}} His conquests, however, were lost within months of his death.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=xv}} The burghers of Breslau soon murdered his captain Heinz Dompnig.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=102}} The Emperor's rule in Vienna and Wiener Neustadt was restored without resistance.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|pp=151<U+2013>152}}

Stephen Z<U+00E1>polya said the King's death relieved "Hungary of the trouble and oppression from which it had suffered so far".{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=345}} Royal authority quickly diminished because various claimants{{mdash}}John Corvinus, Maximilian of the Romans, Vladislaus Jagiellon, and the latter's younger brother, [[John I Albert|John Albert]]{{mdash}}were fighting for the crown.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=69}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=344}} Vladislaus Jagiellon triumphed because the barons regarded him as a weak ruler and he gained the support of Matthias's wealthy widow by promising to marry her.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=69}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=345}} Vladislaus was elected king after he promised he would abolish all "harmful innovations" introduced by Matthias, especially the extraordinary tax.{{sfn|Bak|1994|p=76}} Vladislaus could not finance the maintenance of the Black Army and the unpaid mercenaries began plundering the countryside.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=69}} A royal force led by Paul Kinizsi eliminated them on the river Sz<U+00E1>va in 1492.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=69}}{{sfn|Teke|1981|p=321}}

The burden of Matthias's wars and splendid royal court mainly fell on the peasants, who paid at least 85% of the taxes.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|pp=66<U+2013>67}}{{sfn|Bak|1994|p=71}} The ''Chronicle of Dubnic'', written in eastern Hungary in 1479, says "widows and orphans" cursed the King for the high taxes.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=166}} However, stories about "Matthias the Just", who wandered in disguise throughout his realm to deliver justice to his subjects, seem to have spread during Matthias's reign.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=174<U+2013>175}} The saying "Dead is Matthias, lost is justice" became popular soon after his death, reflecting that commoners were more likely to have received a fair trial in Matthias's reign than under his successors.{{sfn|Bak|1994|p=74}}{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=63}} Matthias is also the subject of popular folk tales in Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, and Slovenia.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=177}} For instance, the philandering [[King Matja<U+017E>]] is one of the [[King in the mountain|sleeping kings]] of Slovenian folklore.{{sfn|Luk<U+00E1>cs|2010|pp=371<U+2013>379}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=177}}
