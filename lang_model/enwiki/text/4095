'''Caffeine''' is a [[xanthine]] [[alkaloid]] [[Chemical compound|compound]] that acts as a [[stimulant]] in humans. The word comes from the French term for coffee, caf<U+00E9>.<ref> "Caffeine" in ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fourth Edition,  2000, [http://www.bartleby.com/61/80/C0018000.html]</ref> Caffeine is also called '''guaranine''' when found in [[guarana]], '''mateine''' when found in [[mate (beverage)|mate]], and '''theine''' when found in [[tea]]. It is found in the [[Leaf|leaves]] and [[coffee bean|bean]]s of the [[coffee]] plant, in [[tea]], [[yerba mate]], and [[guarana]] [[berries]], the [[kola nut]], the [[Yaupon Holly]], and in small quantities in [[cocoa]]. Overall, caffeine is found in the [[bean]]s, [[leaf|leaves]], and [[fruit]] of over 60 [[plants]], where it acts as a natural [[pesticide]] that [[paralyze]]s and kills certain [[insect]]s feeding on the plants.

Caffeine is a [[central nervous system]] (CNS) [[stimulant]], having the effect of temporarily warding off [[drowsiness]] and restoring alertness. Beverages containing caffeine, such as [[coffee]], [[tea]], [[soft drink]]s and [[energy drink]]s enjoy great popularity; caffeine is the world's most widely consumed [[psychoactive substance]], but unlike most other psychoactive substances, it is legal and unregulated in nearly all jurisdictions. In North America, 90% of adults consume caffeine daily.<ref name="demon drink">{{cite journal | last = Lovett | first = Richard | title = Coffee: The demon drink? | journal = New Scientist | issue = 2518|date = [[24 September]] [[2005]] }}</ref> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration lists caffeine as a "Multiple Purpose GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) Food Substance".<ref name=GRAS">{{cite web |url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2003/aprqtr/21cfr182.1180.htm |title=21 CFR 182.1180 |accessdate=2007-02-16 |date=April 1, 2003 |work=U.S. [[Code of Federal Regulations]] |publisher=U.S. [[Office of the Federal Register]] |pages=462 }}</ref>

Many natural sources of caffeine also contain widely varying mixtures of other [[xanthine]] [[alkaloid]]s, including the [[cardiac]] stimulants [[theophylline]] and [[theobromine]] and other substances such as [[polyphenols]] which can form insoluble complexes with caffeine.<ref>Balentine DA, Harbowy ME and Graham HN, ''Tea: the Plant and its Manufacture; Chemistry and Consumption of the Beverage'' in Caffeine (1998), ed.

Caffeine is a [[plant]] [[alkaloid]], found in numerous plant species, where it acts as a natural [[pesticide]] that [[paralyze]]s and kills certain [[insect]]s feeding upon them.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Nathanson | first = JA | title = Caffeine and related methylxanthines: possible naturally occurring pesticides | journal = Science | volume = 226 | issue = 4671 | pages = 184-7 | date = [[12 October]] [[1984]] | id = PMID 6207592 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/226/4671/184 }}</ref> The most commonly used caffeine-containing plants are [[coffee]], [[tea]], and to a little extent [[cocoa]]. Other, less commonly used, sources of caffeine include the [[yerba mate]]<ref>{{cite web | last = Erowid | title = Does Yerba Mat<U+00E9> Contain Caffeine or Mateine? | publisher = The Vaults of Erowid | date = Dec 2003 | url = http://www.erowid.org/plants/yerba_mate/yerba_mate_chemistry1.shtml|accessdate = 2006-08-16 }}</ref> and [[guaran<U+00E1>]] plants, which are sometimes used in the preparation of teas and energy drinks. Two of caffeine's alternative names, ''mateine''<ref>{{cite web | title = PubChem: mateina| publisher = National Library of Medicine | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pccompound&term=mateina | accessdate = 2006-08-16 }}. Generally translated as ''mateine'' in articles written in English</ref> and ''guaranine'',<ref>{{cite web | title = PubChem: guaranine | publisher = National Library of Medicine | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pccompound&term=guaranine | accessdate = 2006-08-16 }}</ref> are derived from the names of these plants.

The world's primary source of caffeine is the coffee bean (the seed of the [[Coffea|coffee plant]]), from which [[coffee]] is brewed. Caffeine content in coffee varies widely depending on the type of [[coffee bean]] and the method of preparation used;<ref name=ICO>{{cite web | title=Caffeine |publisher=International Coffee Organization | url=http://www.ico.org/caffeine.asp|accessdate=2006-08-21}}</ref> even beans within a given bush can show variations in concentration. In general, one serving of coffee ranges from 40&nbsp;milligrams, for a single shot (30&nbsp;milliliters) of ''arabica''-variety [[espresso]], to about 100&nbsp;milligrams for a cup(120&nbsp;milliliters) of drip coffee. Generally, dark-roast coffee has less caffeine than lighter roasts because the roasting process reduces the bean's caffeine content.<ref name=caffaq_roast>{{cite web | title=Coffee and Caffeine FAQ: Does dark roast coffee have less caffeine than light roast? | url=http://coffeefaq.com/site/node/15 | accessdate=2007-01-02}}</ref><ref name=jeremiahspick>{{cite web | title=All About Coffee: Caffeine Level | publisher=Jeremiah<U+2019>s Pick Coffee Co | url=http://www.jeremiahspick.com/caffeine.php | accessdate=2007-01-02}}</ref> [[Coffea arabica|''Arabica'']] coffee normally contains less caffeine than the [[Coffea canephora|''robusta'']] variety.<ref name=ICO/> Coffee also contains trace amounts of [[theophylline]], but no [[theobromine]].

[[Tea]] is another common source of caffeine. Tea usually contains about half as much caffeine per serving as coffee, depending on the strength of the brew. Certain types of tea, such as [[black tea|black]] and [[oolong]], contain somewhat more caffeine than most other teas. Tea contains small amounts of theobromine and slightly higher levels of theophylline than coffee. Preparation has a significant impact on tea, and color is a very poor indicator of caffeine content.<ref>{{cite web | title = Caffeine in tea vs. steeping time | date = September 1996 | url = http://www.nobleharbor.com/tea/caffiene.html|accessdate = 2006-08-12 }}</ref> Teas like the green Japanese [[gyokuro]], for example, contain far more caffeine than much darker teas like [[lapsang souchong]], which has very little.

Caffeine is also a common ingredient of [[soft drink]]s such as [[cola]], originally prepared from [[kola nut]]s. Soft drinks typically contain about 10 to 50&nbsp;milligrams of caffeine per serving. By contrast, [[energy drink]]s such as [[Red Bull]] contain as much as 80&nbsp;milligrams of caffeine per serving, but others, such as the Wired X294 contains 294 milligrams of caffeine. The caffeine in these drinks either originates from the ingredients used or is an additive derived from the product of [[decaffeination]] or from chemical synthesis. [[Guarana]], a prime ingredient of energy drinks, contains large amounts of caffeine with small amounts of [[theobromine]] and [[theophylline]] in a naturally occurring [[slow-release]] [[excipient]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Haskell | first = CF | coauthors = Kennedy D, Wesnes KA, Milne AL, Scholey AB | title = A double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-dose evaluation of the acute behavioural effects of guarana in humans | journal = J Psychopharmacol | volume = 0 | issue = 0 | pages = 0-0|date = [[13 March]] [[2006]]| id = PMID 16533867 | accessdate =  }}; [Epub ahead of print]</ref>

[[Chocolate]] derived from [[cocoa]] contains a small amount of caffeine. The weak stimulant effect of chocolate may be due to a combination of [[theobromine]] and [[theophylline]] as well as caffeine.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Smit | first = HJ | coauthors = Gaffan EA, Rogers PJ. | title = Methylxanthines are the psycho-pharmacologically active constituents of chocolate | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 176 | issue = 3-4 | pages = 412-9 | date = 2004 Nov|url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15549276 }}</ref> Chocolate contains too little of these compounds for a reasonable serving to create effects in humans that are on par with [[coffee]]. A typical 28-gram serving of a milk [[chocolate bar]] has about as much caffeine as a cup of ''decaffeinated'' coffee.

:''Main articles: [[Cocoa#History|History of cocoa]], [[History of coffee]], [[Tea#Origin and early history in Asia|Origin and early history of tea]]''
Humans have consumed caffeine since the [[Stone Age]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Escohotado | first = Antonio | coauthors = Ken Symington | title = A Brief History of Drugs: From the Stone Age to the Stoned Age | publisher = Park Street Press | date = May 1999 | id = ISBN 0-89281-826-3 }}</ref> Early peoples found that chewing the seeds, bark, or leaves of certain plants had the effects of  easing fatigue, stimulating awareness, and elevating mood. Only much later was it found that the effect of caffeine was increased by steeping such plants in hot water. Many cultures have legends that attribute the discovery of such plants to people living many thousands of years ago.

According to one popular Mongolian legend, the [[Emperor of China]] [[Shennong]], reputed to have reigned in about 3,000 BC, accidentally discovered that when some leaves fell into boiling water, a fragrant and restorative [[caffeinated drink|drink]] resulted.<ref>Chow p. 19-20 (Czech edition); also Arcimovicova p. 9, Evans p. 2 and others</ref> Shennong is also mentioned in Lu Yu's ''Cha Jing'', a famous early work on the subject of tea.<ref>{{cite book | last = Yu | first = Lu | title = The Classic of Tea: Origins & Rituals | publisher = Ecco Pr; Reissue edition | date = October 1995 | url = http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0880014164/sr=8-1/qid=1156001072/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-4891513-9260948?ie=UTF8 | id = ISBN 0-88001-416-4 }}</ref>
The history of coffee has been recorded as far back as the ninth century. During that time, coffee beans were available only in their native habitat, [[Ethiopia]].  A popular legend traces its discovery to a [[goatherder]] named [[Kaldi]], who apparently observed goats that became elated and sleepless at night after browsing on coffee shrubs and, upon trying the berries that the goats had been eating, experienced the same vitality. The earliest literary mention of coffee may be a reference to Bunchum in the works of the 9th century [[Persian people|Persian]] physician [[al-Razi]]. In 1587, [[Malaye Jaziri]] compiled a work tracing the history and legal controversies of coffee, entitled "Umdat al safwa fi hill al-qahwa". In this work, Jaziri recorded that one [[Sheikh]], Jamal-al-Din al-Dhabhani, [[mufti]] of [[Aden]], was the first to adopt the use of coffee in 1454, and that in the 15th century the [[sufism|Sufis]] of [[Yemen]] routinely used coffee to stay awake during prayers.

Towards the close of the 16th century, the use  of coffee was recorded by a [[European]] resident in [[Egypt]], and about this time it came into general use in the [[Near East]]. The appreciation of coffee as a beverage in Europe, where it was first known as "Arabian wine," dates from the 17th century. During this time "[[coffee house]]s" were established, the first being opened in [[Constantinople]] and [[Venice]]. In Britain, the first coffee houses were opened in [[London]] in 1652, at St Michael's Alley, [[Cornhill]]. They soon became popular throughout [[Western Europe]], and played a significant role in [[social relation]]s in the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title = Coffee | encyclopedia = Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica | date = 1911}}</ref>

The [[kola nut]], like the coffee berry and tea leaf, appears to have ancient origins. It is chewed in many [[West Africa]]n cultures, individually or in a social setting, to restore vitality and ease hunger pangs. <!-- Unreferenced: Kola was once used to make [[cola]] [[soft drink]]s, though today most of these mass-produced beverages use artificial flavourings and caffeine obtained by the [[decaffeination]] of coffee.{{fact}} --> In 1911, kola became the focus of one of the earliest documented health scares when the US government seized 40 barrels and 20&nbsp;kegs of [[Coca-Cola]] syrup in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], alleging that the caffeine in its drink was "injurious to health".<ref>{{cite journal | last = Benjamin | first = LT Jr | coauthors = Rogers AM, Rosenbaum A | title = Coca-Cola, caffeine, and mental deficiency: Harry Hollingworth and the Chattanooga trial of 1911 | journal = J Hist Behav Sci | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 42-55 | date = 1991 Jan | id = PMID 2010614 | accessdate =  }}</ref> On [[March 13]], [[1911]], the government initiated ''The [[United States v. Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola]]'', hoping to force Coca-Cola to remove caffeine from its formula by making exaggerated claims, such as that the excessive use of Coca-Cola at one girls' school led to "wild nocturnal freaks, violations of college rules and female proprieties, and even immoralities."<ref>{{cite web | last = Jarvis | first = Gail | title = The Rise and Fall of Cocaine Cola | date = [[May 21]] [[2002]] | url = http://www.lewrockwell.com/jarvis/jarvis17.html|accessdate = 2006-08-19 }}</ref> Although the judge ruled in favor of Coca-Cola, two bills were introduced to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in 1912 to amend the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]], adding caffeine to the list of "habit-forming" and "deleterious" substances which must be listed on a product's label.

The earliest evidence of [[cocoa]] use comes from residue found in an [[Maya civilization|ancient Maya]]n pot dated to 600 BC. In the New World, chocolate was consumed in a bitter and spicy drink called ''xocoatl'', often seasoned with [[vanilla]], [[chile pepper]], and [[achiote]]. Xocoatl was believed to fight fatigue, a belief that is probably attributable to the [[theobromine]] and caffeine content. Chocolate was an important luxury good throughout [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]], and cocoa beans were often used as currency.

Chocolate was introduced to [[Europe]] by the [[Spanish people|Spaniard]]s and became a popular beverage by 1700. They also introduced the [[cacao]] tree into the [[West Indies]] and the [[Philippines]]. It was used in [[alchemy|alchemical]] processes, where it was known as Black Bean.

In 1819, the [[Germany|German]] chemist [[Friedrich Ferdinand Runge]] isolated relatively pure caffeine for the first time. According to a legend, he did this at the behest of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].<ref>{{cite book | last =  Weinberg | first = BA | coauthors = BK Bealer | title = The World of Caffeine | publisher = Routledge | date = January 2001 | id = ISBN 0-415-92722-6 }}</ref>

Today, global consumption of caffeine has been estimated at 120,000&nbsp;tons per annum,<ref name="abc.net">{{cite web | title = Whats your poison: caffeine | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date = 1997 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/quantum/poison/caffeine/caffeine.htm | accessdate = 2006-08-20 }}</ref> making it the world's most popular psychoactive substance. This number equates to one serving of a caffeine beverage for every person, per day. In North America, 90% of adults consume some amount of caffeine daily.<ref name="demon drink"/>

==Pharmacology==
Caffeine is a [[central nervous system]] and metabolic stimulant,<ref>{{cite journal | last = Nehlig | first = A | coauthors = Daval JL, Debry G | title = Caffeine and the central nervous system: Mechanisms of action, biochemical, metabolic, and psychostimulant effects | journal = Brain Res Brain Res Rev | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 139-70 | date = 1992 May-Aug | id = PMID 1356551 }}</ref> and is used both recreationally and medically to reduce physical fatigue and restore mental alertness when unusual weakness or drowsiness occurs. Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system first at the higher levels, resulting in increased alertness and wakefulness, faster and clearer flow of thought, increased focus, and better general body coordination, and later at the spinal cord level at higher doses.<ref name="effects">{{cite journal | last = Bolton, Ph.D. | first = Sanford | coauthors = Gary Null, M.S. | title = Caffeine: Psychological Effects, Use and Abuse | journal = Orthomolecular Psychiatry | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 202-211 | date = 1981 | url = http://www.garynull.com/Documents/CaffeineEffects.htm  | accessdate = 2006-08-12 }}</ref> Once inside the body, it has a complex chemistry, and acts through several mechanisms as described below.

===Metabolism===
[[Image:Caffeine metabolites.svg|thumb|right|350px|Caffeine is metabolized in the liver into three primary metabolites:
[[paraxanthine]] (84%), [[theobromine]] (12%), and [[theophylline]] (4%)]]
Caffeine is completely absorbed by the stomach and small intestine within 45 minutes of ingestion. After ingestion it is distributed throughout all tissues of the body and is eliminated by [[Rate equation|first-order kinetics]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Newton | first = R | coauthors = Broughton LJ, Lind MJ, Morrison PJ, Rogers HJ, Bradbrook ID | title = Plasma and salivary pharmacokinetics of caffeine in man | journal = European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 45-52 | date = 1981 | id = PMID 7333346 }}</ref>

The [[Biological half-life|half-life]] of caffeine <U+2014> the time required for the body to eliminate one-half of the total amount of caffeine consumed at a given time <U+2014> varies widely among individuals according to such factors as age, liver function, pregnancy, some concurrent medications, and the level of enzymes in the liver needed for caffeine metabolism. In healthy adults, caffeine's half-life is approximately 3-4 hours. In women taking oral contraceptives this is increased to 5-10 hours,<ref>{{cite journal | last = Meyer | first = FP | coauthors = Canzler E, Giers H, Walther H. | title = Time course of inhibition of caffeine elimination in response to the oral depot contraceptive agent Deposiston. Hormonal contraceptives and caffeine elimination | journal = Zentralbl Gynakol | volume = 113 | issue = 6 | pages = 297-302 | date = 1991 | id = PMID 2058339 }}</ref> and in pregnant women the half-life is roughly 9-11 hours.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Ortweiler | first = W | coauthors = Simon HU, Splinter FK, Peiker G, Siegert C, Traeger A. | title = Determination of caffeine and metamizole elimination in pregnancy and after delivery as an in vivo method for characterization of various cytochrome p-450 dependent biotransformation reactions | journal = Biomed Biochim Acta. | volume = 44 | issue = 7-8 | pages = 1189-99 | date = 1985 | id = PMID 4084271 }}</ref> Caffeine can accumulate in individuals with severe [[liver disease]] when its half-life can increase to 96 hours.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Bolton, Ph.D. | first = Sanford | coauthors = Gary Null, M.S. | title = Caffeine: Psychological Effects, Use and Abuse | journal = Orthomolecular Psychiatry | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 202-211 | date = 1981 | url = http://www.garynull.com/Documents/CaffeineEffects.htm  | accessdate = 2006-08-14 }}</ref> In infants and young children, the half-life may be longer than in adults; half-life in a newborn baby may be as long as 30 hours.

Caffeine is metabolized in the [[liver]] by the [[cytochrome P450 oxidase]] enzyme system (specifically, the [[CYP1A2|1A2]] isozyme) into three [[metabolism|metabolic]] [[xanthine|dimethylxanthines]],<ref>
{{cite web | title = Caffeine | publisher = The Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base | url = http://www.pharmgkb.org/do/serve?objId=464&objCls=DrugProperties#biotransformationData | accessdate = 2006-08-14 }}</ref> which each have their own effects on the body:
* [[Paraxanthine]] (84%) &ndash; Has the effect of increasing [[lipolysis]], leading to elevated [[glycerol]] and free [[fatty acid]] levels in the [[blood plasma]].
* [[Theobromine]] (12%) &ndash; Dilates [[blood vessel]]s and increases [[urine]] volume. Theobromine is also the principal alkaloid in [[cocoa]], and therefore [[chocolate]].
* [[Theophylline]] (4%) &ndash; Relaxes [[smooth muscle]]s of the [[bronchus|bronchi]], and is used to treat [[asthma]]. The therapeutic dose of theophylline, however, is many times greater than the levels attained from caffeine metabolism.

Each of these metabolites is further metabolized and then excreted in the urine.

===Mechanism of action===
[[Image:Caffeine and adenosine.svg|thumb|left|350px|Caffeine's principal mode of action is as an [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of [[adenosine]] receptors in the brain. They are presented here side by side for comparison.]]

Caffeine acts through multiple mechanisms involving both action on receptors and channels on the cell membrane, as well as intracellular action on Calcium and cAMP pathways. By virtue of its [[purine]] structure it can act on some of the same targets as adenosine related nucleosides and nucleotides, like the cell surface P1 [[GPCR]]s for adenosine, as well as the intracellular [[Ryanodine receptor]] which is the physiological target of cADPR ([[cyclic ADP ribose]]), and [[phosphodiesterase|cAMP-phosphodiesterase]] (cAMP-PDE). Although the action is [[agonist]]ic in some cases, it is [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]]ic in others. Physiologically, however, caffeine action is unlikely due to increased RyR opening, as it requires plasma concentration above lethal dosage. The action is most likely through adenosine receptors.

Like alcohol, nicotine, and antidepressants, caffeine readily crosses the [[blood brain barrier]]. Once in the brain, the principal mode of action of caffeine is as an [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of adenosine receptors found in the brain.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Fisone G | first = G | coauthors = Borgkvist A, Usiello A | title = Caffeine as a psychomotor stimulant: mechanism of action | journal = Cell Mol Life Sci | volume = 61 | issue = 7-8 | pages = 857-72 | date = 2004 Apr | id = PMID 15095008 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/605nwu366ay2c6xt/ }}</ref> The caffeine molecule is structurally similar to [[adenosine]], and binds to adenosine receptors on the surface of cells without activating them (an "antagonist" mechanism of action). Therefore, caffeine acts as a competitive inhibitor. The reduction in adenosine activity results in increased activity of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[dopamine]], largely accounting for the stimulatory effects of caffeine. Caffeine can also increase levels of [[epinephrine|epinephrine/adrenaline]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Graham T, Rush J, van Soeren M | title = Caffeine and exercise: metabolism and performance. | journal = Can J Appl Physiol | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 111-38 | year = 1994|id = PMID 8081318}}</ref> possibly via a different mechanism. Acute usage of caffeine also increases levels of [[serotonin]], causing positive changes in mood.

The inhibition of adenosine may be relevant in its [[diuretic]] properties. Because adenosine is known to constrict preferentially the afferent arterioles of the [[glomerulus]], its inhibition may cause vasodilation, with an increase in renal blood flow ([[Renal blood flow|RBF]]) and glomerular filtration rate ([[Glomerular filtration rate|GFR]]). This effect, called [[competitive inhibition]], interrupts a pathway that normally serves to regulate nerve conduction by suppressing post-synaptic potentials. The result is an increase in the levels of [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine|norepinephrine/noradrenaline]] released via the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Fredholm B, B<U+00E4>ttig K, Holm<U+00E9>n J, Nehlig A, Zvartau E | title = Actions of caffeine in the brain with special reference to factors that contribute to its widespread use. | journal = Pharmacol Rev | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 83-133 | year = 1999|id = PMID 10049999}}''[http://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/cgi/content/full/51/1/83 Full text]''</ref> Epinephrine, the natural [[endocrine system|endocrine]] response to a perceived threat, stimulates the [[sympathetic nervous system]], leading to an increased heart rate, [[blood pressure]] and [[blood]] flow to [[muscle]]s, a decreased blood flow to the [[skin]] and inner [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s.  Biochemically, it stimulates [[glycogenolysis]], inhibits [[glycolysis]], and stimulates [[gluconeogenesis]] to produce more [[glucose]] in the muscles and release of [[glucose]] into the blood stream from the liver.

Caffeine is also a known competitive inhibitor of the enzyme [[phosphodiesterase|cAMP-phosphodiesterase]] (cAMP-PDE), which converts [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cyclic AMP]] (cAMP) in cells to its noncyclic form, allowing cAMP to build up in cells. Cyclic AMP participates in activation of [[Protein Kinase A]] (PKA) to begin the phosphorylation of specific enzymes used in glucose synthesis. By blocking its removal caffeine intensifies and prolongs the effects of [[epinephrine]] and epinephrine-like drugs such as [[amphetamine]], [[methamphetamine]], or [[methylphenidate]]. Increased concentrations of cAMP in [[parietal cell]]s causes an increased activation of [[CAMP-dependent protein kinase|protein kinase A]] (PKA) which in turn increases activation of [[Hydrogen potassium ATPase|H+/K+ ATPase]], resulting finally in increased [[gastric acid]] secretion by the cell.

Caffeine (and theophylline) can freely diffuse into cells and causes intracellular calcium release (independent of extracellular calcium) from the calcium stores in the [[Endoplasmic Reticulum]](ER). This release is only partially blocked by Ryanodine receptor blockade with [[ryanodine]], [[dantrolene]], [[ruthenium red]], and [[procaine]] (thus may involve [[ryanodine receptor]] and probably some additional calcium channels), but completely abolished after calcium depletion of ER by [[SERCA]] inhibitors like [[Thapsigargin]] (TG) or [[cyclopiazonic acid]] (CPA).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Verkhratsky A. | title = Physiology and Pathophysiology of the Calcium Store in the Endoplasmic Reticulum of Neurons | journal = Physiol. Rev. | volume = 85 | issue = 1 | pages = 201-279 | year = 2005|doi = 10.1152/physrev.00004.2004}}</ref> The action of caffeine on the ryanodine receptor may depend on both cytosolic and the luminal ER concentrations of Ca2+. At low millimolar concentration of caffeine, the RyR channel open probability (Po) is significantly increased mostly due to a shortening of the lifetime of the closed state. At concentrations >5 mM, caffeine opens RyRs even at picomolar cytosolic Ca2+ and dramatically increases the open time of the channel so that the calcium release is stronger than even an action potential can generate. This mode of action of caffeine is probably due to mimicking the action of the physiologic metabolite of NAD called cADPR ([[cyclic ADP ribose]]) which has a similar potentiating action on [[Ryanodine receptor]]s.

Caffeine may also directly inhibit delayed rectifier and A-type K+ currents and activate plasmalemmal Ca2+ influx in certain vertebrate and invertebrate neurons.

The metabolites of caffeine contribute to caffeine's effects. Theobromine is a [[vasodilation|vasodilator]] that increases the amount of oxygen and nutrient flow to the brain and muscles. Theophylline, the second of the three primary metabolites, acts as a smooth [[muscle relaxant]] that chiefly affects [[bronchiole]]s and acts as a [[chronotropic|chronotrope]] and [[inotrope]] that increases heart rate and efficiency. The third metabolic derivative, paraxanthine, is responsible for an increase in the [[lipolysis]] process, which releases [[glycerol]] and [[fatty acids]] into the blood to be used as a source of fuel by the muscles.<ref>{{cite book | last = Dews | first = P.B. | title = Caffeine: Perspectives from Recent Research | publisher = Berlin: Springer-Valerag | date =  1984 | id = ISBN  978-0387135328 }}</ref>

===Effects when taken in moderation===
[[Image:Caffeinated spiderwebs.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Caffeine has a significant effect on [[spider]]s, which is reflected in their [[spider web|web]] construction]]

The precise amount of caffeine necessary to produce effects varies from person to person depending on body size and degree of tolerance to caffeine. It takes less than an hour for caffeine to begin affecting the body and a mild dose wears off in three to four hours.<ref name= "effects" /> Consumption of caffeine does not eliminate the need for sleep: it only temporarily reduces the sensation of being tired.

With these effects, caffeine is an [[ergogenic aid|ergogenic]]: increasing the capacity for mental or physical labor. A study conducted in 1979 showed a 7% increase in distance cycled over a period of two hours in subjects who consumed caffeine compared to control tests.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Ivy | first = JL | coauthors = Costill DL, Fink WJ, Lower RW | title = Influence of caffeine and carbohydrate feedings on endurance performance | journal = Med Sci Sports | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 6-11 | date = 1979 Spring | id = PMID 481158 }}</ref> Other studies attained much more dramatic results; one particular study of trained runners showed a 44% increase in "race-pace" endurance, as well as a 51% increase in cycling endurance, after a dosage of 9 milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body weight.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Graham | first = TE | coauthors = Spriet, LL | title = Performance and metabolic responses to a high caffeine dose during prolonged exercise | journal = J Appl Physiol | volume = 71 | issue = 6 | pages = 2292-8 | date = 1991 Dec | id = PMID 1778925 }}</ref> The extensive boost shown in the runners is not an isolated case; additional studies have reported similar effects. Another study found 5.5 milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body mass resulted in subjects cycling 29% longer during high intensity circuits.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Trice | first = I | coauthors = Haymes, EM | title = Effects of caffeine ingestion on exercise-induced changes during high-intensity, intermittent exercise | journal = Int J Sport Nutr | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 37-44 | date = Mar 1995 | id = PMID 7749424 }}</ref>

Breathing problems in [[premature birth|premature]] infants, [[apnea of prematurity]], are sometimes treated with [[Caffeine citrate|citrated caffeine]], which is available only by [[medical prescription|prescription]] in many countries.<ref>{{cite web | title = Caffeine  (Systemic) | publisher = MedlinePlus | date = 05/25/2000 | url = http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/uspdi/202105.html | accessdate = 2006-08-12 }}</ref> A reduction in [[bronchopulmonary dysplasia]] has been exhibited in premature infants treated with caffeine citrate therapy regimens.

While relatively safe for humans, caffeine is considerably more toxic to some other animals such as dogs, horses and parrots due to a much poorer ability to metabolize this compound. Caffeine has a much more significant effect on [[spider]]s, for example, than most other drugs do.<ref>Noever, R., J. Cronise, and R. A. Relwani. 1995.

Because caffeine is primarily an [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the central nervous system's receptors for the [[neurotransmitter]] [[adenosine]], the bodies of individuals who regularly consume caffeine adapt to the continual presence of the drug by substantially increasing the number of [[adenosine receptor]]s in the central nervous system. This increase in the number of the adenosine receptors makes the body much more sensitive to adenosine, with two primary consequences.<ref name="PMID 3003150">{{cite journal | last = Green | first = RM | coauthors = Stiles GL | title = Chronic caffeine ingestion sensitizes the A1 adenosine receptor-adenylate cyclase system in rat cerebral cortex | journal = J Clin Invest | volume = 77 | issue = 1 | pages = 222-227 | date = Jan 1986 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=3003150|id = PMID 3003150 }}</ref> First, the stimulatory effects of caffeine are substantially reduced, a phenomenon known as a [[Drug tolerance|tolerance adaptation]]. Second, because these adaptive responses to caffeine make individuals much more sensitive to adenosine, a reduction in caffeine intake will effectively increase the normal physiological effects of adenosine, resulting in unwelcome withdrawal symptoms in tolerant users.<ref name="PMID 3003150"/>

Caffeine tolerance develops very quickly, especially among heavy coffee drinkers. Complete tolerance to sleep disruption effects of caffeine develops after consuming 400 mg of caffeine per day for 7 days. Complete tolerance to subjective effects of caffeine was observed to develop after consuming 300 mg per day for 18 days, and possibly even earlier.<ref>[http://www.acnp.org/G4/GN401000165/CH161.html Caffeine - A Drug of Abuse?]</ref> Partial tolerance to caffeine has been observed in all other areas, studies with mice indicate that after a long period of caffeine exposure the learning benefits of caffeine observed earlier cannot be found to any significant level. Considering that 80% to 90% of American adults consume caffeine daily, and their mean daily caffeine intake exceeds 200 mg/day,<ref>[http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/12355000/pdf/caffeine.PDF Intakes of Selenium, Caffeine, and Theobromine by Adults, 1994-1996]</ref> it can be surmised that a large fraction of the U.S. adult population is completely tolerant to most of the effects of caffeine.

Because adenosine, in part, serves to regulate blood pressure by causing [[vasodilation]], the increased effects of adenosine due to caffeine withdrawal cause the blood vessels of the head to dilate, leading to an excess of blood in the head and causing a [[headache]] and [[nausea]]. Reduced [[catecholamine]] activity may cause feelings of [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] and drowsiness. A reduction in serotonin levels when caffeine use is stopped can cause anxiety, irritability, inability to concentrate and diminished motivation to initiate or to complete daily tasks; in extreme cases it may cause mild [[Depression (mood)|depression]].

This is not the only case where caffeine increases the effectiveness of a drug. Caffeine makes pain relievers 40% more effective in relieving headaches and helps the body absorb headache medications more quickly, bringing faster relief.<ref>{{cite web | title = Headache Triggers: Caffeine | publisher = WebMD | date = June 2004 | url = http://www.webmd.com/content/article/46/1826_50681.htm | accessdate = 2006-08-14 }}</ref> For this reason, many over-the-counter headache drugs include caffeine in their formula. It is also used with [[ergotamine]] in the treatment of [[migraine]] and [[cluster headaches]] as well as to overcome the drowsiness caused by [[antihistamine]]s.

===Overuse===
Caffeine is a drug that in large amounts, especially over an extended period of time, can lead to a condition termed "caffeinism." Caffeinism usually combines "caffeine [[chemical dependency|dependency]]" with a wide range of unpleasant physical and mental conditions including [[nervousness]], [[irritability]], [[anxiety]], [[Tremor|tremulousness]], [[muscle twitching]] ([[hyperreflexia]]), [[insomnia]], [[headaches]], and [[heart palpitation]]s.<ref name="EofMD">{{cite web | title = Caffeine-related disorders | publisher = Encyclopedia of Mental Disorders | url = http://www.minddisorders.com/Br-Del/Caffeine-related-disorders.html|accessdate = 2006-08-14 }}</ref>   Furthermore, because caffeine increases the production of stomach acid, high usage over time can lead to [[peptic ulcer]]s, erosive [[esophagitis]], and [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) | publisher = Cedars-Sinai | url = http://www.csmc.edu/pf_5543.html | accessdate = 2006-08-14 }}</ref> However, since both "regular" and decaffeinated coffees have also been shown to stimulate the gastric mucosa and increase stomach acid secretion, caffeine is probably not the only component of coffee responsible.<ref>{{cite web | title = Erowid Caffeine Vault: Effects | publisher = The Vaults of Erowid | date = Jul 08, 2006 | url = http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/caffeine/caffeine_effects.shtml | accessdate = 2006-08-14 }}</ref>

There are four caffeine-induced psychiatric disorders recognized by the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], Fourth Edition'': caffeine intoxication, caffeine-induced anxiety disorder, [[caffeine-induced sleep disorder]], and caffeine-related disorder not otherwise specified (NOS).

Some other side effects of Caffeine overuse include:  dizziness, fast heartbeat, blurred vision, drowsiness, dry mouth, flushed dry skin, increased urination, loss of appetite, nausea and stomachache,s.<ref name="mlp">{{cite web | title = Caffeine  (Systemic)| publisher = Medline Plus | url = http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/uspdi/202105.html|accessdate = 2007-02-25 }}</ref> often associated with too much coffee.

===Caffeine intoxication===
An acute overdose of caffeine, usually in excess of 400 milligrams (more than 3-4 cups of brewed coffee), can result in a state of central nervous system overstimulation called caffeine intoxication. Some people seeking caffeine intoxication resort to  insufflation (snorting) of caffeine powder, usually finely crushed caffeine tablets. This induces a faster more intense reaction. The symptoms of caffeine intoxication may include restlessness, [[nervousness]], excitement, insomnia, flushing of the face, [[diuresis|increased urination]], [[Gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] disturbance, [[fasciculation|muscle twitching]], a rambling flow of thought and speech, [[cardiac arrhythmia|irregular]] or  [[tachycardia|rapid heart beat]], and [[psychomotor agitation]].<ref name="EofMD"> In cases of much larger overdoses [[mania]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], lapses in judgment, [[disorientation]], loss of social inhibition, [[delusions]], [[hallucinations]], [[psychosis]], [[rhabdomyolysis]], and [[death]] may occur.<ref>{{cite web | title = Caffeine overdose | publisher = MedlinePlus | date = 4/4/2006 | url = http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002579.htm | accessdate = 2006-08-14 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Kamijo | first = Y | coauthors = Soma K, Asari Y, Ohwada T | title = Severe rhabdomyolysis following massive ingestion of oolong tea: caffeine intoxication with coexisting hyponatremia | journal = Veterinary and Human Toxicology | volume = 41 | issue = 6 | pages = 381-3 | date = 1999 Dec | id = PMID 10592946 }}</ref>

In cases of extreme overdose, death can result. The median lethal dose ([[LD50|LD<sub>50</sub>]]) of caffeine is 192&nbsp;milligrams per kilogram in rats.<ref>{{cite web | title = Erowid Caffeine Vault: Caffeine Dosage | publisher = The Vaults of Erowid | date = Jul 08, 2006 | url = http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/caffeine/caffeine_dose.shtml | accessdate = 2006-08-14 }}</ref> The LD<sub>50</sub> of caffeine in humans is dependent on weight and individual sensitivity and estimated to be about 150 to 200&nbsp;milligrams per kilogram of body mass, roughly 80 to 100 cups of coffee for an average adult taken within a limited timeframe that is dependent on [[Biological halflife|half-life]]. Though achieving lethal dose with caffeine would be exceptionally difficult with regular coffee, there have been reported deaths from overdosing on caffeine pills, with serious symptoms of overdose requiring hospitalization occurring from as little as 2 grams of caffeine.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Kerrigan | first = S | coauthors = Lindsey T | title = Fatal caffeine overdose: two case reports | journal = Forensic Sci Int | volume = 153 | issue = 1 | pages = 67-9 | date = 2005 | url = http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?A=ShowDoc1&ID=6700 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Holmgren | first = P | coauthors = Norden-Pettersson L, Ahlner J | title = Caffeine fatalities <U+2014> four case reports | journal = Forensic Sci Int | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 71-3 | date = 2004 | url = http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?A=ShowDoc1&ID=6702 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Walsh | first = I | coauthors = Wasserman GS, Mestad P, Lanman RC | title = Near-fatal caffeine intoxication treated with peritoneal dialysis | journal = Pediatr Emerg Care | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 244-9 | date = Dec 1987 | id = PMID 3324064 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Mrvos | first = RM | coauthors = Reilly PE, Dean BS, Krenzelok EP | title = Massive caffeine ingestion resulting in death | journal = Vet Hum Toxicol | volume = 31 | issue = 6 | pages = 571-2 | date = Dec 1989 | id = PMID 2617841 }}</ref> Death typically occurs due to [[ventricular fibrillation]] brought about by effects of caffeine on the cardiovascular system.

Treatment of severe caffeine intoxication is generally supportive, providing treatment of the immediate symptoms, but if the patient has very high serum levels of caffeine then [[peritoneal dialysis]], [[hemodialysis]], or [[hemofiltration]] may be required.

===Anxiety and sleep disorders===
Long-term overuse of caffeine can elicit a number of psychiatric disturbances. Two such disorders recognized by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) are ''caffeine-induced sleep disorder'' and ''caffeine-induced anxiety disorder''.

In the case of caffeine-induced [[sleep disorder]], an individual regularly ingests high doses of caffeine sufficient to induce a significant disturbance in his or her sleep, sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.<ref name="DSM-IV">{{cite book | authorlink = http://www.psych.org/ | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth Edition.|publisher = [[American Psychiatric Association]] | date = 1994 | id = ISBN 0-89042-062-9 }}</ref>

In some individuals, the large amounts of caffeine can induce [[anxiety]] severe enough to necessitate clinical attention. This caffeine-induced [[anxiety disorder]] can take many forms, from [[general anxiety disorder|generalized anxiety]], to [[panic attack]]s, [[obsessive-compulsive]] symptoms, or even [[Phobia|phobic symptoms]].<ref name="DSM-IV"/> Because this condition can mimic organic mental disorders, such as [[panic disorder]], [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], or even [[schizophrenia]], a number of medical professionals believe caffeine-intoxicated people are routinely misdiagnosed and unnecessarily medicated when the treatment for caffeine-induced psychosis would simply be to withhold further caffeine.<ref>{{cite book | last = Shannon | first = MW | coauthors = Haddad LM, Winchester JF | title = Clinical Management of Poisoning and Drug Overdose, 3rd ed. | date = 1998 | id = ISBN 0-7216-6409-1 }}</ref> A Study in the ''British Journal of Addiction'' concluded that caffeinism, although infrequently diagnosed, may afflict as many as one person in ten of the population.<ref>{{cite journal | last = James | first = JE | coauthors = KP Stirling | title = Caffeine: A summary of some of the known and suspected deleterious effects of habitual use | journal = British Journal of Addiction | volume = 78 | issue = 3 | pages = 251-8 | date = Sep 1983 | id = PMID 6354232 }}</ref>

===Parkinson's disease===
Several large studies have shown that caffeine intake is associated with a reduced risk of developing [[Parkinson's disease]] (PD) in men, but studies in women have been inconclusive. The mechanism by which caffeine affects PD remains a mystery. In animal models, researchers have shown that caffeine can prevent the loss of dopamine-producing nerve cells seen in PD, but researchers still don't know how this occurs.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/news_and_events/news_articles/news_article_parkinson_caffeine_hrt.htm | title=New Findings About Parkinson's Disease: Coffee and Hormones Don't Mix | publisher=[[NIH|National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]]}}</ref>

===Effects on memory and learning===
An array of studies found that caffeine could induce certain changes in memory and learning. In one study, caffeine was added to rat neurons ''[[in vitro]]''. The [[dendritic spines]] (a part of the brain cell used in forming connections between neurons) taken from the [[hippocampus]] (a part of the brain associated with memory), grew by 33% and new spines formed. After an hour or two, however, these cells returned to their original shape.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/472473.stm | title=Caffeine clue to better memory | date=October 12, 1999 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>

Another study showed that subjects - after receiving 100 milligrams of caffeine - had increased activity in brain regions located in the frontal lobe, where a part of the working memory network is located, and the [[anterior cingulum]], the part of the brain that controls attention. The caffeinated subjects also performed better on the memory tasks.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Caffeine-Boosts-Short-Time-Memory-13828.shtml | title=Caffeine Boosts Short-Time Memory }}</ref>

However, a different study showed that caffeine could impair short term memory and increase the likelihood of the [[tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon]]. The study allowed the researchers to suggest that caffeine could aid short-term memory when the information to be recalled is related to the current train of thought, but also to hypothesize that caffeine hinders short-term memory when the train of thought is unrelated.<ref>{{cite news | http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3909085.stm | title=A coffee can make you forgetful | date=20 July, 2004 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>

===Effects on baldness===
A study has found that caffeine blocks the effects of [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT), known to damage [[hair follicle]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | author = T. W. Fischer MD | coauthors = U. C.

==Extraction of pure caffeine==
{{main|Decaffeination}}
[[Image: Caffeine_USP.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Anhydrous]] (dry) [[United States Pharmacopoeia|USP]]-grade caffeine]]

Pure caffeine is a white powder, and can be extracted from a variety of natural sources. Caffeine extraction is an important industrial process and can be performed using a number of different solvents. [[Benzene]], [[chloroform]], [[trichloroethylene]] and [[dichloromethane]] have all been used over the years but for reasons of safety, environmental impact, cost and flavor, they have been superseded by the following main methods:

===Water extraction===
Coffee beans are soaked in water. The water, which contains not only caffeine but also many other compounds which contribute to the flavor of coffee, is then passed through [[Activated carbon|activated charcoal]], which removes the caffeine. The water can then be put back with the beans and evaporated dry, leaving decaffeinated coffee with a good flavor.<ref name=Decaffeination>{{cite web |last=Senese | first=Fred | title=How is coffee decaffeinated? | publisher=General Chemistry Online | date=2005-09-20 | url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/consumer/faq/decaffeinating-coffee.shtml | accessdate=2006-08-21}}</ref>  Coffee manufacturers recover the caffeine and resell it for use in soft drinks and medicines.

===Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction===
[[Supercritical carbon dioxide]] is an excellent nonpolar solvent for caffeine (as well as many other organic compounds), and is safer than the organic solvents that are used for caffeine extraction. The extraction process is simple: CO<sub>2</sub> is forced through the green coffee beans at temperatures above 31.1&nbsp;<U+00B0>C and pressures above 73&nbsp;[[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]. Under these conditions, CO<sub>2</sub> is in a "[[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]]" [[Phase (matter)|state]]: it has gaslike properties which allow it to penetrate deep into the beans but also liquid-like properties which dissolve 97-99% of the caffeine. The caffeine-laden CO<sub>2</sub> is then sprayed with high pressure water to remove the caffeine. The caffeine can then be isolated by [[Activated carbon|charcoal adsorption]] (as above) or by [[distillation]], [[recrystallization]], or [[reverse osmosis]].<ref name=Decaffeination />

===Extraction by nonhazardous organic solvents===
Organic solvents such as [[ethyl acetate]] present much less health and environmental hazard than previously used chlorinated and aromatic solvents. The hydrolysis products of ethyl acetate are [[ethanol]] and [[acetic acid]], both nonhazardous in small quantities. Another method is to use triglyceride oils obtained from spent coffee grounds.
