There are [[List of the British Isles by area|more than 6,000 islands]] in the group, the largest two being [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]]. Great Britain is to the east and covers 216,777&nbsp;km<U+00B2> (83,698&nbsp;square&nbsp;miles), over half of the total landmass of the group. Ireland is to the west and covers 84,406&nbsp;km<U+00B2> (32,589&nbsp;square&nbsp;miles). The largest of the other islands are to be found in the [[Hebrides]], [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] to the north, [[Anglesey]] and the Isle of Man between Great Britain and Ireland, and the [[Channel Islands]] near the coast of [[France]].

The islands are at relatively low altitudes, with central Ireland and southern Great Britain particularly low lying: the lowest point in the islands is [[the Fens]] at <U+2212>4&nbsp;[[metres|m]] (<U+2212>13&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]). The [[Scottish Highlands]] in the northern part of Great Britain are mountainous, with [[Ben Nevis]] being the highest point in the British Isles at 1,344&nbsp;m (4,409&nbsp;ft). Other mountainous areas include Wales and parts of the island of Ireland, but only seven peaks in these areas reach above 1,000&nbsp;m (3,281&nbsp;ft). Lakes on the islands are generally not large, although [[Lough Neagh]] in Northern Ireland is an exception, covering 381&nbsp;km<U+00B2> (147&nbsp;square&nbsp;miles); the largest freshwater body in Great Britain is [[Loch Lomond]] at 71.1&nbsp;km<U+00B2> (27.5&nbsp;square&nbsp;miles). Neither are rivers particularly long, the rivers [[River Severn|Severn]] at 354&nbsp;km (219&nbsp;miles) and [[River Shannon|Shannon]] at 386&nbsp;km (240&nbsp;miles) being the longest.

The British Isles have a [[temperate climate|temperate]] [[marine climate]], the [[North Atlantic Drift]] ("Gulf Stream") which flows from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] brings with it significant moisture and raises temperatures 11<U+00B0>[[Celsius|C]] (20<U+00B0>[[Fahrenheit|F]]) above the global average for the islands' latitudes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mayes| first=Julian| coauthors=Dennis Wheeler| title=Regional Climates of the British Isles| year=1997| publisher=Routledge| location=London| pages=p. 13}}</ref> Winters are thus warm and wet, with summers mild and also wet. Most Atlantic [[Low pressure area|depressions]] pass to the north of the islands, combined with the general [[Westerlies|westerly circulation]] and interactions with the landmass, this imposes an east-west variation in climate.<ref><!--Mayes, ''Regional Climates of the British Isles''-->Ibid., pp. 13<U+2013>14.</ref>

=== Transport ===
[[Heathrow Airport]] is the busiest airport in Europe in terms of passenger traffic and the Dublin-London route is the busiest air-route in Europe,<ref>Se<U+00E1>n McC<U+00E1>rthaigh, [http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2003/03/31/story437213650.asp Dublin<U+2013>London busiest air traffic route within EU], Irish Examiner, March 31, 2003</ref> and the second-busiest in the world. Europe's two largest [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost airlines]], [[Ryanair]] and [[easyJet]], operate from Ireland and Britain respectively. 

The [[English Channel]] and the Southern [[North Sea]] are the busiest seaways in the world {{Fact|date=June 2007}}. The car [[ferry]], [[M/F Ulysses]], traveling the [[Irish Sea]] is the largest in the world. The [[Channel Tunnel]], opened 1994, links Great Britain to [[France]] and is the second-longest rail tunnel in the world. The idea of building a tunnel under the Irish Sea has been raised since 1895,<ref>"TUNNEL UNDER THE SEA", The Washington Post, May 2, 1897 [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/282943272.html?dids=282943272:282943272&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=MAY+02%2C+1897&author=&pub=The+Washington+Post&desc=TUNNEL+UNDER+THE+SEA&pqatl=google (Archive link)]</ref> when it was first investigated, but is not considered to be economically viable{{Fact|date=June 2007}}. Several potential Irish Sea tunnel projects have been proposed, most recently the ''Tusker Tunnel'' between the ports of [[Rosslare]] and [[Fishguard]] proposed by [[The Institute of Engineers of Ireland]] in 2004.<ref>A Vision of Transport in Ireland in 2050, [http://www.iei.ie/Publications/GetPublicationDetails.pasp?PublicationID=69&Module=Papers&txt_freetext=&RecordsPerPage=1000&PageNumber=1&MenuID=24 IEI report (pdf)], The Irish Academy of Engineers, 21/12/2004</ref><ref>Tunnel 'vision' under Irish Sea, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/4121001.stm (link)], [[BBC]] news, Thursday, 23 December, 2004</ref> A different proposed route is between [[Dublin]] and [[Holyhead]], proposed in 1997 by a leading British engineering firm, Symonds, for a rail tunnel from Dublin to Holyhead. Either tunnel, at 80&nbsp;km, would be by far the longest in the world, and would cost an estimated <U+20AC>20 billion. A proposal in 2007,<ref>BBC News, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6956570.stm From Twinbrook to the Trevi Fountain], 21 August 2007</ref> estimated the cost of building a bridge from [[County Antrim]] in Northern Ireland to [[Galloway]] in Scotland at BGP<U+00A3>3.5bn (<U+20AC>5bn). However, none of these are thought to be economically viable at this time.

===Geology===
{{main|Geology of the British Isles}}
[[Image:British-Isles-NW-European-shelf.png|thumb|350px|A data-generated image showing the British Isles sitting on the north-west of the [[Geography of Europe|European]] [[continental shelf]].]]

The British Isles lie at the juncture of several regions with past episodes of [[tectonic]] mountain building. These [[Orogeny|orogenic belts]] form a complex geology which records a huge and varied span of earth history.<ref>{{cite book| last=Goudie| first=Andrew S.| coauthors=D. Brunsden| title=The Environment of the British Isles, an Atlas| year=1994| publisher=Clarendon Press| location=Oxford| pages=p. 2}}</ref> Of particular note was the [[Caledonian Orogeny]] during the [[Ordovician]] Period, ca. 488<U+2013>444 [[Annum|Ma]] and early [[Silurian]] period, when the [[craton]] [[Baltica]] collided with the [[terrane]] [[Avalonia]] to form the mountains and hills in northern Britain and Ireland. Baltica formed roughly the north western half of Ireland and Scotland. Further collisions caused the [[Variscan orogeny]] in the [[Devonian]] and [[Carboniferous]] periods, forming the hills of [[Munster]], south-west England, and south Wales. Over the last 500 million years the land which forms the islands has drifted northwest from around 30<U+00B0>S, crossing the [[equator]] around 370 million years ago to reach its present northern latitude.<ref><!--Goudie, ''The Environment of the British Isles, an Atlas''-->Ibid., p. 5.</ref> 

The islands have been shaped by numerous glaciations during the [[Quaternary Period]], the most recent being the [[Devensian]]. As this ended, the central [[Irish Sea]] was de-glaciated (whether or not there was a land bridge between Great Britain and Ireland at this time is somewhat disputed, though there was certainly a single ice sheet covering the entire sea) and the [[English Channel]] flooded, with sea levels rising to current levels some 4,000 to 5,000 years ago, leaving the British Isles in their current form.

The islands' geology is highly complex, though there are large amounts of [[limestone]] and [[chalk]] rocks which formed in the [[Permian]] and [[Triassic]] periods. The west coasts of Ireland and northern Great Britain that directly face the [[Atlantic Ocean]] are generally characterized by long [[peninsulas]], and headlands and bays; the internal and eastern coasts are "smoother".

[[Image:Bi-density.png|thumb|250px|A population density map of the British Isles. Dublin and London, with respective population densities of 1,288 and 4,761 are shaded blue.]]

The demographics of the British Isles show dense population in England, which accounts for almost 80% of the total population of the region. In Ireland, Northern Ireland. Scotland, Wales dense populations are limited to areas around, or close to, their respective capitals. Major populations centers (greater than one million people) exist in the following areas:

* [[Greater London Urban Area]] (8.5 million)
** [[London metropolitan area]] (12<U+2014>14 million)
* [[West Midlands conurbation]] (2.3 million)
* [[Greater Manchester Urban Area]] (2.2 million)
* [[West Yorkshire Urban Area]] (2.1 million)
* [[Greater Dublin Area]] (1.7 million)
* [[Greater Glasgow]] (1.2 million)

The population of England has risen steadily throughout its history, while the populations of Scotland and Wales have shown little increase during the twentieth century - the population of Scotland remaining unchanged since 1951. Ireland, which for most of its history comprised a population proportionate to its land area, one third of the total population, has since the [[Great Irish Famine|Great Famine]] fallen to less than one tenth of the population of the British Isles. The famine, which caused a century-long population decline, decimated the Irish population and permanently altered the demographic make-up of the British Isles. On a global scale this disaster led to the creation of an [[Irish diaspora]] that number fifteen-times more than the current population of the island.

==Political co-operation within the islands==

Between 1801 and 1922, Great Britain and Ireland together formed the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].<ref>Though the [[Irish Free State]] left the United Kingdom on [[6 December]] [[1922]] the name of the United Kingdom was not changed to reflect that until April 1927, when ''Northern Ireland'' was substituted for ''Ireland'' in its name.</ref> In 1922, twenty-six counties of Ireland left the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom following the [[Irish War of Independence]]; the remaining six counties, mainly in the northeast of the island, became known as [[Northern Ireland]]. Both states, but not the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands, are members of the [[European Union]].

However, despite independence of most of Ireland, political cooperation exists across the islands on some levels:

*'''Travel'''. Since Irish partition an informal free-travel area has continued to exist across the entire region; in 1997 it was formally recognised by the [[European Union]], in the [[Amsterdam Treaty]], as the [[Common Travel Area]].  There have recently been reports <ref> [http://www.ireland.com/newspaper/frontpage/2007/1024/1193158824220.html] Irish Times, Oct 24th 2007 </ref> that the UK Government is planning to end this arrangement, although the details are not yet clear. 
*'''Voting rights'''. No part of the British Isles considers a citizen of any other part as an 'alien.' This pre-dates and goes much further than that required by European Union law, and gives common voting rights to all citizens of the jurisdictions within the archipelago. Exceptions to this are presidential elections and referendums in the Republic of Ireland. Other EU nationals may only vote in local and European Parliament elections while resident in either the UK or Ireland.
*'''Diplomatic'''. Bilateral agreements allow UK embassies to act as an Irish consulate when Ireland is not represented in a particular country. 
*'''Northern Ireland'''. The typical relations of nation states do not apply in [[Northern Ireland]] as the [[Irish Government]] is entitled to a consultative role in its government and citizens of Northern Ireland are entitled to the choice of Irish or British citizenship or both. 
*'''The [[British-Irish Council]]''' was set up in 1999 following the 1998 [[Belfast Agreement]]. This body is made up of all political entities across the islands, both the sovereign governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom, the devolved governments of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and the dependencies of Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man. It has no executive authority but meets biannually to discuss issues of mutual importance, currently restricted to the misuse of drugs, the environment, the knowledge economy, social inclusion, tele-medicine, tourism, transport and national languages of the participants.
*'''The [[British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body]]''' ({{lang-ga|Comhlact Idir-Pharlaiminteach Na Bretaine agus Na h<U+00C9>ireann}}) was established in 1990. Originally it comprised 25 members of the [[Oireachtas]], the Irish parliament, and 25 members of the [[parliament of the United Kingdom]], with the purpose of building mutual understanding between members of both legislature. Since then the role and scope of the body has been expanded with the addition of five representatives from the [[Scottish Parliament]], five from the [[National Assembly for Wales]] and five from the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]. One member is also taken from the [[States of Jersey]], one from the [[States of Guernsey]] and one from the [[High Court of Tynwald]] (Isle of Man). With no executive powers, it may investigate and collect witness evidence from the public on matters of mutual concern to its members, these have in the past ranged from issues such as the delivery of health services to rural populations, to the Sellafield nuclear facility, to the mutual recognition of penalty points against drivers across the British Isles. Reports on its findings are presented to the governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom.

==History==
{{UKHBS}}
{{main|History of the British Isles}}
The British Isles have a long and complex shared history. While this tends to be presented in terms of national narratives, many events transcended modern political boundaries. In particular these borders have little relevance to early times and in that context can be misleading, though useful as an indication of location to the modern reader. Also, cultural shifts which historians have previously interpreted as evidence of invaders eliminating or displacing the previous populations are now, in the light of genetic evidence, perceived by a number of archaeologists and historians as being to a considerable extent changes in the culture of the existing population brought by groups of immigrants or invaders who at times became a new ruling <U+00E9>lite.

===Prehistory===
At a time when the islands were still joined to continental Europe, ''[[Homo erectus]]'' brought [[Palaeolithic]] tool use to the south east of the modern British Isles some 750,000 years ago followed (about 500,000 years ago) by the more advanced tool use of ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' found at [[Boxgrove]]. It appears that the [[glacier|glaciation]] of [[ice age]]s successively cleared all human life from the area, though human occupation occurred during warmer interglacial periods. Modern humans appear with the [[Aurignacian]] culture about 30,000 years ago, famously with the "[[Red Lady of Paviland]]" in modern Wales. The last ice age ended around 10,000 years ago, and [[Mesolithic]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s spread to all parts of the islands by around 8,000 years ago, at a time when rising sea levels now cut off the islands from the continent. The immigrants came principally from the ice age refuge in what is now the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]], with a smaller immigration from refuges in the modern [[Ukraine]] and [[Moldavia]]. Three quarters of the ancestors of people of the British Isles may have arrived in this wave of immigration.<ref>Stephen Oppenheimer, ''Myths of British Ancestry'', Prospect, Issue 127, p.50 (Oct. 2006)</ref>

Around 6,500 years ago farming practices spread to the area with the [[Neolithic Revolution]] and the western seaways quickly brought [[megalithic]] culture throughout the islands. The earliest stone house still standing in northern Europe is at [[Knap of Howar]], in Orkney which also features such monuments as [[Maes Howe]] ranking alongside the [[Callanish stone circle]] on the Isle of Lewis, [[Newgrange]] in Ireland, and [[Stonehenge]] in southern England along with thousands of lesser monuments across the isles, often showing affinities with megalithic monuments in France and Spain.<ref>[http://www.britarch.ac.uk/BA/ba63/feat2.shtml British Archaeology Magazine - People of the Sea] article by [[Barry Cunliffe]]</ref> Further cultural shifts in the [[Bronze Age]] were followed with the building of numerous [[hill fort]]s in the [[Iron Age]], and increased trade with continental Europe.

===Celts, Romans and Anglo-Saxons===
Early historical records of the islands, notably descriptions from [[Pytheas]] and [[Ptolemy]], portray numerous named tribes while using ''[[Priteni]]'' or ''Pretani'' as an overall collective term, ''Hiberni'' for the inhabitants of Ireland and ''Albiones'' for those of Great Britain, though it is questionable if these people identified themselves with any grouping larger than the tribe.<ref>{{Harvnb | Snyder| 2003|p=2<U+2013>5}}</ref> Later scholars associated these tribal societies with the [[Celt]]s the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] reported in what is now south-West Germany, and sub-grouped their ''[[Celtic languages]]'' in the British Isles into the [[Brythonic languages]] spoken in most of Great Britain, and [[Goidelic]] in Ireland. They perceived these languages as arriving in a series of invasions, but modern evidence suggests that these peoples may have migrated from [[Anatolia]] around 7000&nbsp;BC through southern and then Western Europe.<ref name = "Oppenheimer">Oppenheimer, ''ibid.''</ref> Genetic evidence indicates that there was not a later large-scale replacement of these early inhabitants<ref>B.McEvoy, M.Richards, P.Forster, and D.G. Bradley, The Longue Dur<U+00E9>e of Genetic Ancestry: Multiple Genetic Marker Systems and Celtic Origins on the Atlantic Facade of Europe, Am J Hum Genet. October 2004; 75(4): 693<U+2013>702. [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1182057]</ref> and that the Celtic influence was largely cultural. In the [[Scottish highlands]] northwards the people the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] called [[Caledonians]] or [[Picts]] spoke a language which is now unknown and extinct. It is also possible that southern England was settled by Belgic tribes.<ref name = "Oppenheimer" />

During the first century the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] established [[Roman Britain]] which became a province of the [[Roman Empire]] named ''Britannia''. It included most of the island of Great Britain but never consolidating control over the highlands of [[Caledonia]], and around 180 drew back to [[Hadrian's Wall]] with tribes forming friendly [[buffer state]]s further north to around the [[Firth of Clyde]] and the [[Firth of Forth]]. The interaction of the Romans with Ireland appears to have been limited to some trade. From the 4th century raids on Roman Britain increased and language links have led to speculation that many Britons migrated across the [[English Channel]] at this time to found [[Brittany]], but it has been contended that Armorica was already Brythonic speaking due to trade and religious links, and the Romans subsequently called it  ''Brittania''.<ref>{{Harvnb | Snyder| 2003|p=149}}</ref>

The end of Roman rule around 410 was followed by the formation of numerous kingdoms across most of Britain. Subsequent settlement in [[Sub-Roman Britain]] by peoples traditionally called the [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], and [[Jutes]] created Anglo-Saxon kingdoms ("the [[Heptarchy]]") over much of what is now Eastern England and [[Gododdin|south-east Scotland]]. Between the 5th and 10th centuries England was divided into areas of British and Anglo-Saxon control, with the latter gradually expanding westward. The Irish raiders known as [[Scoti]] attacked many areas of Britain, and that name was also used for [[Gaels]] from [[D<U+00E1>l Riata]] in north eastern Ireland and later to settlers from Ireland in western Scotland.

===National formation===

The [[Vikings]] arrived in the British Isles in the 790's with raids on [[Lindisfarne]], [[Iona]], and the west of Ireland. They provided another wave of immigration, settling in Orkney and Shetland and then [[Western Isles]], [[Caithness]], [[Sutherland]], [[Isle of Man]], [[Galloway]], [[Northumbria]], [[East Anglia]] and [[Mercia]] and founding the cities of [[Limerick]], [[Waterford]], [[Wexford]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Arklow]], and [[Dublin]] in Ireland. [[Wessex]] prevented the further expansion of the Vikings in England, and achieved a united [[Kingdom of England]] in 927, which was then ruled by both English and Viking kings until [[Battle of Stamford Bridge|1066]]. In 900&nbsp;A.D. [[Domnall II of Scotland|Donald II]] was the first [[Kingdom of Alba|king of Alba]] rather than king of the Picts. His successors amalgamated all the kingdoms north of the English border into the [[Kingdom of Alba]], later known as the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], and fixed its southern border on the [[River Tweed|Tweed]] in 1018 , approximating the current England-Scotland border. Wales, still divided following the Roman withdrawal, was divided into a number of [[Brythons|Brythonic]] kingdoms, with the exception from one short period of unification, and also suffered from Viking raids in the tenth century.

[[Early Medieval Ireland 800<U+2013>1166|Ireland]], having like England and Scotland been divided among around eighty to a hundred petty kingdoms, began to slowly amalgamate into eight to ten [[Provinces of Ireland|provincial kingdoms]] by the tenth century. Nominally these were governed by a single [[High King of Ireland|High King]], with the title floating between an ever fewer number of noble dynasties with increasing national authority. Viking influence in Irish affairs was crushed in the 980 [[Battle of Tara]]. Following the 1014 [[Battle of Clontarf]], they turned their attention to Scotland and especially England, conquered by the Viking [[Canute the Great]] the following year. The same battle, however, resulted in the death [[Brian Boru]], who had effectively united Ireland, causing a power vacuum and a series of bloody factional wars.

===Norman immigration===

The [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066 first brought England under Norman rule then extended their influence over the rest of the British Isles {{Fact|date=October 2007}}. The Normans were centralisers and expansionists. Their lands within the British Isles were part of extensive holdings across north-Western Europe held within a feudal framework.  [[History of Wales#Wales and the Normans: 1067 - 1282|Wales]] was brought under their control by the end of the 11th century, but not successfully held until 1283. In 1072 the Normans forced the Scottish king to submit to their feudal overlordship, something they would regularly assert during the mediaeval period. The Normans did not supplant the Scottish political structure, but had great influence over it, eventually supplying the [[Scotland in the High Middle Ages#Scoto-Norman kings: David I to Alexander III|kings of the Scots]] from 1150 and then [[Wars of Scottish Independence|asserting independence]] of the Scottish Crown from that of England. The Scottish Crown gradually gained control of Norse areas, annexing the [[Kingdom of Mann and the Isles]] in 1266, and Orkney and Shetland from [[Norway]] in 1472. In 1169, the Normans were [[Norman invasion of Ireland|invited to Ireland]] to aid a provincial king whose lands had been confiscated by the High King. Papal permission was granted, by the only English head of the [[Catholic Church]] to sit in Rome, [[Pope Adrian IV]], for the annexation of the country, to be a feudal possession of the English crown, as the [[Lordship of Ireland]]. Although immediately transferred to the king's second son, this reverted to the English crown with [[King John of England|John]]'s unexpected accession to the throne of his father.

During the [[Middle Ages]], the Normans slowly intermarried with the previous populations and adopted their language and customs. In England, the Anglicisation of the Norman elite was driven by the slow erosion of their lands elsewhere, but it was 1362 before [[Anglo-Norman Language|Anglo-Norman]] gave way to [[Middle English]] to become the language of the law courts. In Ireland, a Gaelic resurgence at the close of the 13th century led the Norman to famously become "[[more Irish than the Irish themselves]]", adopting Gaelic customs, laws and language, intermarrying with the native nobility and rebelling against the English crown. The 1360 [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] were intended to stem this tide by legislating the death penalty for any Englishman (as the Normans were then known) who consorted with the Irish in this way. However, little could be done, save an expensive re-conquest, to bring Ireland back under English law and by the 15th century only a fortified twenty-mile radius around [[Dublin]], known as [[the Pale]], was loyal to the English crown.

===Protestant reformation and civil wars===
The feudal system decayed and by the end of the sixteenth century was replaced by a system of centralised states. The English throne had come under the Welsh [[Tudors]], who centralised government in England,  [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], and  [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535<U+2013>1542|Wales]]. In 1603 [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland]] brought England and Scotland into [[Union of the Crowns|personal union]] and promoted the existence of a modern British identity.  

These changes happened at the same time as the [[Protestant reformation]] where the Roman Catholic church had been replaced by national churches to which all people were expected to adhere to. Failure to do so resulted in prosecution for [[recusancy]] and heavy fines, and recusants laid themselves open to accusations of treason and loss of land. By 1600 there was a wide range of religious belief within the islands from [[Presbyterian]] Calvinists (who were the majority in much of Scotland) and [[Congregational Church|Independents]] to episcopal Calvinists (in the [[Church of Ireland]] and parts of Scotland)  to Protestant Episcopalians that retained formal liturgy (especially the  [[Church of England]]) to Roman Catholicism (which retained a large majority in Ireland).   

James, and his son, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], favoured political and religious centralisation and uniformity throughout the British Isles. They favoured episcopal, [[Arminianism|Armininian]] churches with a formal liturgy, which antagonised many Protestants. In addition, James, although he followed a policy of relative religious toleration, worsened the position of Irish Catholics by expanding the policy of [[Plantations of Ireland|plantation]] in Ireland, most notably in the [[Plantation of Ulster]] where forfeited lands from Catholics were settled by Scottish and English Protestants and by barring Catholics from serving in public office. Charles tried to force central, personal government. He attempted to bypass institutions he could not control and impose a uniform non-Calvinistic settlement throughout the islands.

The result was the [[Bishops Wars#First Bishops' War (1639)|First Bishops War]] in Scotland in 1639, when the Scottish Presbyterians rebelled against Charles' religious policies. The crisis rapidly spread to Ireland, in the form of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] and then to England, where Parliament refused to raise an army for Charles to fight in Scotland or Ireland, fearing that it would next be used against them. The [[English Civil War]] broke out in 1642. Collectively, these conflicts are known as the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], a shifting series of conflicts and alliances within Britain and Ireland. The King's supporters were known as the Royalists and had forces in England, Scotland (mostly episcopalian and Catholic [[Scottish Highlands|highlanders]]), and Ireland. The English Parliamentary forces (mostly presbyterian and independents) fought against them, but were defeated in England by 1645. The Scottish presbyterians (the [[Covenanter]]s) were allied to the English Parliament, while the Irish Catholic [[Confederate Ireland|Confederates]] were loosely allied with the Royalists. 

By 1649 Parliamentary forces ruled England and executed Charles and the Covenanters had secured Scotland. An alliance between the Catholic Confederates and the Royalists in Ireland resulted in the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|parliamentary conquest of Ireland]], followed by a brutal guerrilla campaign which officially ended in 1653.  [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] repudiated the Irish alliance in 1650 in order to enter one with the Covenanters instead and invaded England. He was defeated in 1651 and the result was that the entire British Isles were brought under the English parliamentary army. There was religious toleration of Protestant denominations (though no episcopalian church), but Catholics were strongly repressed. In Ireland they were disenfranchised and dispossessed with Catholic land ownership dropping from 60% to 8% and their land was confiscated to pay off the Parliament's debts. Some of the land was given to another wave of Protestant immigrants, especially former soldiers, but these were not sufficient to replace the existing Irish, so Ireland became a land largely owned by Protestant landlords with Catholic tenants.

===The return of the Stuarts===
The restoration of Charles II in 1660 reversed many of the [[English Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] measures: the three kingdoms were separated again, the episcopalian Churches of England and Ireland re-established, a Presbyterian Church of Scotland established, and Protestant [[nonconformism]] repressed. A small proportion of the confiscated lands in Ireland were restored, bringing Catholic ownership up to 20%. In1685 brought Charles' brother, [[James II of England|James II]], a Catholic, to the thrones. James [[Declaration of Indulgence|suspended]] the laws discriminating against those not adhering to the national churches; but he attempted personal rule with a large standing army and heavy-handedly attempted to replace Anglicans with Catholics. This alienated the English establishment who invited the Dutch [[William III of England|William, Prince of Orange]] to depose James in favour of his daughter, [[Mary II of England|Mary]]. On William's landing, James fled first to France and then to Ireland where the government remained loyal to him. Here he was defeated, and the position of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] cemented with the imposition of [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] there that effectively denied nearly all Catholics (75% of the population) any sort of power or substantial property.  

James and his descendants attempted to recover the throne [[Jacobite risings|several times]] over the next sixty years, but failed to gain sufficient active support and were consistently defeated.  

===Kingdom of Great Britain and social revolutions===

The [[1707]] [[Act of Union 1707|Act of Union]] united England and Scotland in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. The next century saw the start of great social changes.  [[Enclosure]] had been taking place over a long period in England, but the [[British Agricultural Revolution]] accelerated the process by which land was privatised, commercialised, and intensively exploited, and caused it to spread throughout the British Isles. This resulted in the displacement of large numbers of people from the land and widespread hardship, including the [[Highland Clearances]] in which many of the residents of the Scottish highlands were systematically removed to make the land available for sheep farming.<ref> Prebble, John. (1969). Penguin Books. ISBN 978-0140028379 </ref> In addition, the [[industrial revolution]] saw the displacement of cottage industries by large-scale factories and the rapid growth of industrial towns and cities. The  [[British Empire]] grew substantially, stoking the growth in industrial production, bringing in wealth, giving rise to large-scale emigration, and making [[London]] the largest city in Europe.  

Social unrest and repressive government accompanied these upheavals. The ideals of the [[French Revolution]] were widely supported and led to a full-scale [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]] in Ireland. A result of the rebellion was the start of the end of Ascendancy hegemony in Ireland and its political [[Act of Union 1800|unification]] with Great Britain in 1801. Unrest throughout the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] continued well into the 19th century, but was increasingly legitimised and able to find an outlet in Parliament from the [[Great Reform Act]] of 1832 onwards. The role of religion in determining political markedly decreased from the [[Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Act]] in 1829 onwards. The social upheavals continued with widespread migration from the countryside to towns and cities and abroad. Ireland suffered a [[Great Irish Famine|famine]] from 1845 until 1849 which resulted in its population dropping by a third through death and migration. This included large-scale movements to Great Britain, especially to the north west of England and western Scotland. Emigration from the whole of the British Isles overseas continued, especially to the English-speaking parts of the British Empire, the United States, and other countries such as [[Argentina]].

===The twentieth century===

Prosperity increased in England through the nineteenth and into the twentieth century and politics became increasingly popular and democratic. The suspension of the Home Rule Act 1914, the subsequent Easter Rising, and the [[Anglo-Irish War]] led to the formation of the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922, which subsequently survived the [[Irish Civil War]]. The Irish Free State existed until a new constitution in 1937. The Irish state held [[dominion]] status until 1949, when it became a [[Republic of Ireland|republic]]. During [[World War II]], the Irish Free State stayed officially neutral under a [[The Emergency|state of emergency]].

Six counties in the north-east were politically separated from the rest of Ireland in 1920, forming [[Northern Ireland]]. They remained part of the United Kingdom with a devolved government until 1972 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/9/newsid_4071000/4071849.stm], when direct rule was imposed from London following the failure of a power-sharing assembly. There have been extensive periods of [[The Troubles|unrest]] in Northern Ireland which has seen several periods of direct rule in the subsequent decades as the parties within Northern Ireland failed to reach practical agreement on power sharing.  

Within the United Kingdom there are [[devolution|devolved]] governments in [[Welsh Assembly|Wales]] and [[Scottish Parliament|Scotland]], and in [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Northern Ireland]] although each has different powers.  

Attempts at long-needed economic reforms by the UK government in the wake of the [[Great Irish Famine]] (1845-1849) resulted in mass migration from Ireland to Great Britain. Despite attempts by the Irish governments, north and south, to stem the tide, the pattern continued following independence, with notable post-independence spikes in the 1950s and 1980s. Since the mid-1990s Ireland has grown more prosperous and the Irish [[Gross Domestic Product]] per capita now exceeds that of the United Kingdom. Both the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland joined the [[European Economic Community]] (now the [[European Union]]) in 1973.  

The end of the [[British Empire]] in the latter half of the twentieth century saw the end of large-scale emigration from Great Britain; instead, there was new non-Irish imigration to Great Britain, especially from the [[West Indies]] and the Indian sub-continent. Recently, with the accession of Poland and other former communist states to the European Union, there has been significant migration to both Britain and Ireland from eastern [[Europe]].

===Names of the islands through the ages===
{{Mergeto|British Isles naming dispute|date=June 2007}} 
[[Image:Ptolemy-british-isles.jpg|thumb|350px|A 1490 Italian copy of Ptolemy's ''Geography'' showing ''Ibernia Britannica Insula'' ("Hibernia, Island of Britannia", Ireland), ''Albion Insula Britannica'' ("Albion, Island of Britannia", Great Britain) and ''Mona Insula'' (Isle of Man) separated from the European mainland by ''Oceanus Germanicus'' ("Germanic Ocean", North Sea) to the east and ''Oceanus Britannicus'' ("Britannic Ocean", English Channel) to the south.]]

In classical times, several Greek and Roman Geographers used derivatives of the Celtic Languages term "Pretani", like "Brit-" or "Prit-" with various endings to describe the islands to the north west of the European mainland, although several included islands not currently viewed as part of the "British Isles", e.g. Thule. Later in the Roman era the term Britannia came to mean more specifically the Roman province of Britain.  

Other early classical geographers and also later native sources in the post-Roman period used the general term "oceani insulae", simply meaning "islands of the ocean". Great Britain was called "Britannia" and Ireland was called "Hibernia" and also, between about the fifth and eleventh centuries, "Scotia". The Orkneys ("Orcades") and Isle of Man were typically also mentioned in descriptions of the islands. No specific collective term for the islands was used other than "islands of the ocean". 

The term "British Isles" entered the English language in the seventeenth century as the description of Great Britain, Ireland and the surrounding islands, but was not in common use until at least the second half of the seventeenth century<ref>"When I refer to the composite Monarchy ruled over by James VI and I and by King Charles I, it is always described as Britain and Ireland, and I deliberately avoid the politically loaded phrase 'the British Isles' not least because this was not a normal usage in the political discourse of the time". Canny, Nicholas (2001). Making Ireland British:. New York: Oxford University Press, p. viii. ISBN-13:. </ref> and, in general, the modern notion of "Britishness" only started to become common after the 1707 Act of Union.<ref> Snyder "The Britons", P281, quoting Linda Colley.</ref>  While it is probably the most common term used to describe the islands, use of this term is not universally accepted and is sometimes rejected<ref> "...I have called the Atlantic archipelago <U+2013> since the term <U+2018>British Isles<U+2019> is one which Irishmen reject and Englishmen decline to take quite seriously." Pocock, J.G.A. (2006). The Discovery of Islands. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 29. ISBN-13:978-0521850957. </ref> in Ireland. 

Other descriptions are also used, including "Great Britain and Ireland", "The British Isles and Ireland", "Britain and Ireland", and the deliberately vague "these isles", as well as other less common designations like "IONA" (Islands of the North Atlantic), "The Anglo-Celtic Isles", etc. 

====Pretanic Islands and Britanniae====
The earliest known names for the islands come from copies of [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] writings. These include the [[Massaliote Periplus]], a merchants' handbook from around [[500 BC]] that describes searoutes,<ref>{{Harvnb | Snyder| 2003|p=12}}, {{Harvnb | <U+00D3> Corr<U+00E1>in| 1989|p=1}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb | Cunliffe| 2002|pp=38-45, 94}} The [[Massaliote Periplus]] describes a sea route south round the west coast of Spain from the promontory of [[Oestriminis]] ([[Cape Finisterre]]) back to the Mediterranean. The poem by [[Avienus]] makes used of it in describing the voyage of [[Himilco the Navigator]], also incorporating fragments from 11 ancient writers including [[Pytheas]]. When Avienus says it's two days sailing from Oestriminis to the Holy Isle, inhabited by the Hierni, near Albion, this differs from the sailing directions of the Periplus and implies that Oestriminis is [[Brittany]], a conflict explained if it had been taken by Avienus from one of his other sources.</ref> and the travel writings of the Greek [[Pytheas]] from around [[320 BC]]. Although the earliest texts have been lost, excerpts were quoted or paraphrased by later authors. The main islands were called ''Ierne'', equating to the term ''[[<U+00C9>riu]]'' for [[Ireland]],<ref>{{Harvnb | <U+00D3> Corr<U+00E1>in| 1989|p=1}}</ref> and ''[[Albion]]'' for modern-day [[Great Britain]].

It is often taken as a reference to the practice by the inhabitants of painting or [[tattoo]]ing their skin, though as it is unusual for an [[ethnonym]] or self-description to describe appearance, this name may have been used by the [[Gael]]s of [[Armorica]].<ref>{{Harvnb | Cunliffe| 2002|p=95}},[http://www.celticgrounds.com/chapters/encyclopedia/p.html Encyclopedia of the Celts]: Pretani</ref>  There is considerable confusion about early use of these terms and the extent to which similar terms were used as self-description by the inhabitants.<ref>{{Harvnb | Cunliffe| 2002|p=94}}</ref> From this name a collective term for the islands was used, appearing as <U+03B1><U+03B9> <U+03A0><U+03C1><U+03B5><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03B9> <U+03BD><U+03B7><U+03C3><U+03BF><U+03B9> (''Pretanic Islands'')<ref>{{Harvnb | O'Rahilly| 1946}}</ref> and <U+03B1><U+03B9> <U+0392><U+03C1><U+03B5><U+03C4><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03B1><U+03B9> (''Brittanic Isles'').<ref>{{Harvnb | Snyder| 2003|p=12}}</ref> Cognates of all these terms are still used.<ref>Cognates of ''Albion'' (normally referring only to Scotland) - English: ''Albion'' (archaic); Cornish: ''Alban''; Irish: ''Alba''; Manx: ''Albey''; Scots: ''Albiane''; Scottish Gaelic: ''Alba''; Welsh: ''Yr Alban''.

In 55 and 54 BC [[Caesar's invasions of Britain]] brought first hand knowledge, and in his [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]] he introduced the term [[Britannia]].<ref>[[wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 4#20|4.20]] provides a translation describing Caeser's first invasion, using terms which from [[wikisource:Commentarii de bello Gallico - Liber IV#20|IV.XX]] appear in [[Latin]] as arriving "tamen in Britanniam", the inhabitants being "Britannos", and on p30 "principes Britanniae" is translated as "chiefs of Britain".</ref> 

Around AD 70 [[Pliny the Elder]] in Book 4 of his ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Naturalis Historia]]'' describes the islands he considers to be ''Britanniae'' as including Great Britain, Ireland, The Orkneys, smaller islands such as the Hebrides, Isle of Man, Anglesey, possibly one of the Friesan Islands, and islands that have been identified as Ushant and Sian. He refers to Great Britain as the island called ''Britannia'', while noting that its former name was ''Albion''. The list also includes the island of Thule, most often identified as Iceland, although some express the view that it may have been the [[Faroe Islands]], the coast of [[Norway]] or [[Denmark]] or possibly [[Shetland]].<ref name = "Bostock">"The opinions as to the identity of ancient Thule have been numerous in the extreme. We may here mention six: <U+2015> 1. The common, and apparently the best founded opinion, that Thule is the island of Iceland. 2. That it is either the Ferroe group, or one of those islands. 3. The notion of Ortelius, Farnaby, and Sch<U+0153>nning, that it is identical with Thylemark in Norway. 4. The opinion of Malte Brun, that the continental portion of Denmark is meant thereby, a part of which is to the present day called Thy or Thyland. 5. The opinion of Rudbeck and of Calstron, borrowed originally from Procopius, that this is a general name for the whole of Scandinavia. 6. That of Gosselin, who thinks that under this name Mainland, the principal of the Shetland Islands, is meant. It is by no means impossible that under the name of Thule two or more of these localities may have been meant, by different authors writing at distant periods and under different states of geographical knowledge. It is also pretty generally acknowledged, as Parisot remarks, that the Thule mentioned by Ptolemy is identical with Thylemark in Norway."{{cite book |editor=Bostock, John and H.T.

[[Ptolemy]] included essentially the same main islands in the Britannias. He was writing around AD 150, though he used the now lost work of [[Marinus of Tyre]] from around fifty years earlier.<ref name=ohi>{{Harvnb | <U+00D3> Corr<U+00E1>in| 1989}}</ref> His first description is of Ireland, which he called ''Hibernia''. Second was the island of Great Britain, which he called Albion.

Following the [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquest of AD 43]] the [[Roman Britain|Roman province]] of [[Britannia]] was established,<ref>{{Harvnb | Snyder| 2003|p=34}}</ref> and [[Roman Britain]] expanded to cover much of the island of Great Britain. An invasion of Ireland was considered, but this was taken no further and Ireland remained outside the Roman Empire.<ref>{{Harvnb | <U+00D3> Corr<U+00E1>in| 1989|p=3}}</ref> The Romans failed to consolidate their hold on the [[Scottish Highlands]], and the northern extent of the area under their control, which at times was defined by the [[Antonine Wall]] across central Scotland, stabilised at [[Hadrian's Wall]] across the north of England by about AD 210.<ref>{{Harvnb | Snyder| 2003|p=46}}</ref>  Inhabitants of the province continued to describe themselves as ''Brittannus'' or ''Britto'', and gave their ''patria'' (homeland) as ''Britannia'' or as their tribe.<ref>{{Harvnb | Snyder| 2003|p=54}} refers to epigraphic evidence from those Britons at home and abroad who left Latin inscriptions.</ref> The vernacular term ''Priteni'' came to be used for the barbarians north of the Antonine Wall, with the Romans using the tribal name ''[[Caledonians|Caledonii]]'' more generally for these peoples who after AD 300 they called [[Picts]].<ref>{{Harvnb | Snyder| 2003|p=68}}, {{Harvnb | Cunliffe| 2002|p=95}}</ref> 

The post-Roman era saw [[Brythonic]] kingdoms established in all areas of Britain except the [[Scottish Highlands]], but coming under increasing attacks from [[Picts]], [[Scotti]] and [[Anglo Saxons]]. At this time Ireland was dominated by the Gaels or Scotti, who subsequently gave their name to Ireland and then to Scotland, where it still applies.

====Oceani insulae====

In classical geography. the world of the Mediterranean was thought to be surrounded by a fast flowing river, personified as the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]  ''[[Oceanus]]''. As a result, islands off the north and west shores of continental Europe were termed (in Latin) the ''[[Oceani Insulae]]'' or Islands of the Ocean. For example, in AD 43 various islands, including Britain, Ireland and Thule, were described as "Septemtrionalis Oceani Insulae", meaning ''Islands of the Northern Ocean'', by [[Pomponius Mela]], one of the earliest Roman geographers.<ref>[http://ourworld.cs.com/latintexts/m306.htm POMPONII MELAE] DE SITU ORBIS</ref>  

This description was also used in indigenous sources of the post-Roman period, which also used the term "Oceani Insulae" or "Islands of the Ocean" as a term for the islands in the Atlantic and elsewhere. One such example is the ''[[Life of Saint Columba]]'', a [[hagiography]] recording the [[missionary]] activities of the [[sixth century]] Irish monk [[Saint Columba]] among the peoples of modern-day Scotland. It was written in the late seventh century by [[Adomn<U+00E1>n of Iona|Adomn<U+00E1>n]] of [[Iona]], an Irish monk living on the [[Inner Hebridean]] island.<ref>Book 2, 46 in the Sharpe edition = Book 2, 47 in Reeves edition.   </ref> No ''Priteni''-derived collective reference is made.  [[Jordanes]] writing in [[Getica (Jordanes)|Getica]] (AD 551)  also describes the various islands, particularly in the western Ocean as "islands of the ocean", naming various islands in the North Atlantic, and believing Scandinavia to be one of them.<ref>Jordanes, [http://www.hieronymus.us/Goths/Goths1.htm Getica - De Origine Actibusque Gothorum], Chapter 1, section 7-9</ref>  Jordanes subsequently gives a description of Britain, but does not mention Ireland.

Another native source to use the term is the ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' of [[Bede]] written in the early eighth century. Bede's work does not give a collective term for the archipelago, referring to ''Brittania'' solely as the island "formerly called Albion" and treating Ireland separately. As with Jordanes and Columba, he refers to Britain as being ''Oceani insula'' or "island of the ocean".<ref>Bede, Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation, Book I - In [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bede.html Latin] and [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/bede-book1.html English]</ref> 

[[Isidore of Seville]]'s Etymology, written in the early seventh century and one of the most used textbooks in Europe throughout the Middle Ages,<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08186a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia article on Isidore]</ref> similarly lists Britain (Britannia), Ireland (called Scotia or Hibernia), Thule, and many other islands simply as "islands" or "islands of the Ocean" and uses no collective term.  

In the seventeenth century, Peter Heylyn in ''Microcosmus'' described the Classical conception of the Ocean and so included in the ''Iles of the Ocean'' consisted of all the classically known offshore islands, that is [[Zeeland]], [[Denmark]], the British Isles, and those in the ''Northerne Sea''.<ref>Peter Heylyn, Microcosmus, p.p.453--454(1621)</ref>

====British Isles====
[[Image:British Empire 1897.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The term ''British Isles'' came into use in English at the same time as the term ''British Empire.''  This map shows the British Isles (red) at the centre of the empire (pink) at its height in 1897 where England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales are referred to as the [[Home Nations]].]]

In his ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' of around 1136, [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] responded to the slights of English historians with a theme of the [[sovereignty]] of [[Great Britain|Britain]] which exalted Welsh national history, portraying a once unified [[Britannia]], founded by [[Brutus of Troy]], defended against [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] invasion by [[King Arthur]] of the [[Britons]] who was now sleeping, one day to return to the rescue. By the end of the century, this adaptation of myths common to [[Wales]], [[Cornwall]] and [[Brittany]] had been adopted in the service of [[England]], with [[Henry II of England]] enthusiastically taking up [[Arthurian legend]], and [[Edward I of England]] putting on pageantry to show the Welsh that he was Arthur's heir. The Welsh and the Scots [[Edward Bruce]] used the legends to find common cause as one "kin and nation" in driving the English out of Britain.<ref>{{Harvnb | Snyder| 2003|pp=231-236, 243-246}}</ref> Both Welsh rebels and English monarchs continued such claims, particularly [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]] who had Welsh ancestry and claims of descent from Arthur. His son [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] incorporated Wales into England, but also laid claim to be an heir of Arthur as did his successor [[Elizabeth I of England]].<ref>{{Harvnb | Snyder| 2003|pp=274-276}}</ref>

The rediscovery of [[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Ptolemy's ''Geographia]]'' by [[Maximus Planudes]] in 1300 brought new insight, and circulation of copies widened when it was translated into Latin in 1409.<ref>Jeppe Strandsbjerg, 2006, {{PDFlink|[http://www.bisa.ac.uk/2006/pps/strandsbjerg.pdf The Cartographic Production of Territory: mapping and Danish state formation]|1.39&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 1465891 bytes -->}}, BISA Conference, University College Cork writes: "The translation of Ptolemy<U+2019>s Geography into Latin in 1409 is frequently named as the symbolic beginning of this process because it (re-)introduced the principles that inform scientific cartography to Western Europe."</ref><ref>Utpal Mukhopadhyay, {{PDFlink|[http://www.ias.ac.in/resonance/Mar2005/pdf/Mar2005p08-18.pdf Mercator and his Map]|945&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 968298 bytes -->}}, Renonance, March, 2005 ("The Geographia of Ptolemy contained a world map and twenty six other maps.

The geographer and occultist [[John Dee]], of Welsh family background,<ref>[http://www.johndee.org/charlotte/Chapter1/1p3.html Chapter 1 Page 3] from {{cite book|author=Fell Smith, Charlotte|date=1909|title=John Dee: 1527 - 1608|location=London|publisher=Constable and Company|url=http://www.johndee.org/charlotte/}}</ref> was an adviser to Queen Elizabeth I of England, and also prepared maps for several explorers. He helped to develop legal justifications for colonisation by [[English Reformation|Protestant England]], breaking the [[duopoly]] the Pope [[Inter caetera|had granted]] to the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Empire]]s. Dee coined the term ''[[British Empire]]'' and built his case in part on the claim of a ''[[British Ocean]]'' including Britain and Ireland as well as Iceland, Greenland and possibly extending to North America, using alleged Saxon precedent to claim territorial and trading rights.<ref name=kenm>Ken MacMillan, 2001, "[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3686/is_200104/ai_n8932217/pg_1 Discourse on history, geography, and law: John Dee and the limits of the British empire,]" in the Canadian Journal of History, April 2001</ref> Current scholarly opinion is generally that "his imperial vision was simply propaganda and antiquarianism".<ref name=kenm/> The [[Lordship of Ireland]] had come under tighter English control as the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], and diplomatic efforts [[Rough Wooing|interspersed with warfare]] tried to also bring Scotland under the English monarch. Apparently Dee used the term ''Brytish Iles'' in his writings of 1577 which developed his arguments claiming these territories.<ref>  John Dee, ''General and rare memorials pertayning to the Perfect Arte of Navigation'', London (1577), p.63; see''Queen Elizabeth as Astraea'', Frances A. Yates (Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Vol. 10, (1947), p.47</ref> This appears to be the first use of a recognisable version of the modern term. 

Elizabeth was succeeded by her cousin king [[James VI of Scotland]], who brought the English throne under his personal rule as king James I of England, and proclaimed himself as 'King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland'.<ref>[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/britstyles.htm#1604 Proclamation styling James I King of Great Britain on October 20, 1604]</ref> However, the states remained separate until the monarchy was overthrown in the [[the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|civil wars of the Three Kingdoms]] and the [[Commonwealth of England]] briefly ruled all before the [[English Restoration|restoration of the monarchy]] restored separate states.

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] states that the first published use in English of "British Isles" was in 1621 (before the civil wars) by [[Peter Heylin]] (or Heylyn) in his ''Microcosmus: a little description of the great world'',<ref>''Peter Heylyn'', Oxford English Dictionary, second ed. Online Version (2000)</ref> a collection of his lectures on historical geography. Writing from his English political perspective, he grouped Ireland with Great Britain and the minor islands by three asserting points:<ref>Peter Heylyn, ''Microcosmus'', p.502 (1621).</ref>
*The inhabitants of Ireland must have come from Britain as it was the nearest land.
*He notes that ancient writers, such as Ptolemy, called Ireland a "''Brtti<U+0283>h Iland''".
*He cites the observation of the first century Roman writer [[Tacitus]] that the habits and disposition of the people in Ireland were not much unlike the "''Brittaines''",<ref>Tacitus himself had treated Ireland and Britain separately and had also seen similarities between the Britons and the Gauls of the continent. Tacitus: Germania and Agricola; Chpt 10.</ref>

Modern scholarly opinion<ref>R.J. Mayhew, 2000, "Geography is Twinned with Divinity: The Laudian Geography of Peter Heylyn" in Geographical Review, Vol. 90, No. 1 (Jan., 2000), pp. 18-34
"In the period between 1600 and 1800, politics meant what we might now term 'high politics', excluding the cultural and social elements that modern analyses of ideology seek to uncover. Politics referred to discussions of dynastic legitimacy, of representation, and of the Constitution. ...

"Geography books spanning the period from the Reformation to the Reform Act ... demonstrated their authors' specific political identities by the languages and arguments they deployed. This cannot be seen as any deviation from the classical geographical tradition, or as a tainting of geography by politics, because geography was not to be conceived separately from politics."</ref><ref>Robert Mayhew, 2005, "{{PDFlink|1=[http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FBJH%2FBJH38_01%2FS0007087404006478a.pdf&code=8789cbc2d44877fcad870197ef071dd8 Mapping science's imagined community: geography as a Republic of Letters,]}}" in the British Journal of the History of Science, 38(1): 73-92, March 2005</ref> is that Heylyn "politicized his geographical books Microcosmus ... and, still more, Cosmographie" in the context of what geography meant at that time. Rather, Heylyn's geographical work must be seen as political expressions concerned with proving or disproving constitutional matters and "demonstrated their authors' specific political identities by the languages and arguments they deployed." In an era when "politics referred to discussions of dynastic legitimacy, of representation, and of the Constitution ... [Heylyn's] geography was not to be conceived separately from politics."

<!--this assertion isn't supported by the "British Isles Old Maps" lists of links...Although other mapmakers (for example the Schagen Map<ref> Schagen Map, late seventeenth century from the University of Amsterdam [http://dpc2.uba.uva.nl/cgi/i/image/image-idx?sid=e55c1998f2bd0e1775d344dab7b7c2ce;med=1;q1=carto;rgn1=carto_all;size=20;c=carto;lasttype=boolean;view=entry;lastview=thumbnail;subview=detail;cc=carto;entryid=x-411329928;viewid=1806A19-11.TIF;start=61;resnum=73]
</ref>) continued to use descriptions like "Angliae, Scotiae et Hiberniae", the precedent set by Mercator and Ortelius (who were probably the most influential mapmakers of the period), and the ongoing changes in the political situation in Great Britain and Ireland during the seventeenth century, meant that the term was very commonly used in maps by the late seventeenth century{{Fact|date=February 2007}} and quickly became near universal.-->
Following the [[Act of Union (1707)|Acts of Union of 1707]] the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and conflict with France brought a new popular enthusiasm for Britishness, mostly in Britain itself,<ref>{{Harvnb | Snyder| 2003|p=281}}</ref> and the term ''British Isles'' came into common use despite the persistent stirrings of [[Irish nationalism]]. A desire for some form of Irish independence had been active throughout the centuries, with [[Poyning's Law]] a common focus of resentment. After the hugely turbulent sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, a sort of nationalism surfaced among the Irish Protestant population and eventually lead to the legislative independence of the Irish Parliament under Grattan's Parliament - followed after the Act of Union in 1800 by renewed assertiveness of the Irish Catholics, who first agitated for [[Catholic Emancipation]] and later for Repeal of the Union under [[Daniel O'Connell]].

Subsequently the [[Great Irish Famine]], the [[Land War]], the failure of [[William Gladstone]] and [[Charles Stuart Parnell]] to get partial independence or [[Home Rule]] through the Westminster Parliament lead to the events of and the eventual total secession/independence of most of Ireland from the United Kingdom and the end of British rule in most of Ireland.

==Languages==
[[Image:BI-langs.svg|thumb|350px|{{legend|red|Language branches}}{{legend|blue|Modern languages}}{{legend|green|Typical spoken locations}}<hr/>A combined [[Venn diagram]] showing language branches, major languages and typically where they are spoken for [[modern languages]] in the British Isles.]]

The ethno-linguistic heritage of the British Isles is very rich in comparison to other areas of similar size, with twelve [[languages]] from six groups across four branches of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Language family|family]]. The [[Insular Celtic languages]] of the [[Goidelic]] sub-group ([[Irish language|Irish]], [[Manx language|Manx]], [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]]) and the [[Brythonic]] sub-group ([[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Breton language|Breton]], spoken in [[Brittany|north-western France]]) are the only remaining [[Celtic languages]] - their [[Continental Celtic languages|continental relations]] becoming extinct during the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries CE. The [[Norman language]]s of [[Guern<U+00E9>siais]], [[J<U+00E8>rriais]] and [[Sercquiais]] are spoken in the Channel Islands, as is [[French language|French]]. A [[Cant (language)|cant]], called [[Shelta]], is a language spoken by [[Irish Traveller|Irish Travelers]], often as a means to conceal meaning from those outside the group. However, [[English language|English]], sometimes in the form of [[Scots language|Scots]], is the dominant language, with few [[Monoglottism|monoglots]] remaining in the other languages of the region.

The use of languages, apart from English, roughly coincides with the major ethno-cultural regions in the British Isles. As such, many of them, especially the Celtic languages, have become intertwined with national movements in these areas, seeking either greater independence from the parliament of the United Kingdom, seated in England, or complete secession. The common history of these languages has been one of sharp decline in the mid-19th century, prompted by centuries of economic deprivation and official policy to discourage, even outlaw, their use in favour of English. However, since the mid-twentieth century there has been somewhat of a [[Language revival|revival]] of interest in maintaining and using them. Celtic-language [[Medium of instruction|medium]] schools are available throughout Ireland, Scotland and Wales to such an extent that it is now possible to receive all formal education, up to and including third-level education, through a Celtic language. Instruction in Irish and Welsh is compulsory in all schools in the Republic of Ireland and Wales respectively. In the Isle of Man, Manx in taught in all schools, although it is not compulsory, and there is one Manx-medium school. The respective languages are official languages of state in Ireland, the Isle of Man, Scotland and Wales, with equal status with respect to English. In the Channel Islands French is a legislative and administrative language (see ''[[Jersey Legal French]]''). Since 2007, Irish is a working language of the [[European Union]].

[[Image:BI-lang-pc.png|thumb|335px|Number able to speak indigenous languages as a percentage of appropriate population area in the British Isles. Note: Figure for English is for whole of the British Isles and includes native speakers only.]]

Cornish and the Norman languages of Guern<U+00E9>siais, J<U+00E8>rriais and Sercquiais are far less supported. In Jersey, a language office (''L'Office du J<U+00E8>rriais'') is funded to provide education services for J<U+00E8>rriais in schools and other language services, while Guern<U+00E9>siais is taught in some schools on a volunteer basis. Of the four, only Cornish is recognised officially under the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], and it is taught in some schools as an optional modern language. Guern<U+00E9>siais and J<U+00E8>rriais are recognised as regional languages by the British and Irish governments within the framework of the British-Irish Council. Scots, as either a dialect of or a closely related language to English, is similarly recognised by the European Charter, the British-Irish Council, and as "part of the cultural wealth of the island of Ireland" under the Good Friday Agreement. However, it is without official status as a language of state in Scotland, where English is used in its place.

[[Shelta]], spoken by the ethnic minority Irish Travellers, is thought to be spoken by 6,000<U+2013>25,000 people, according to varying sources. Although evidence suggests that it existed as far back as the 13th century, as a [[secret language]], it was only discovered at the end of the 19th century. It is without any official status, despite being thought to have 86,000 speakers worldwide, mostly in the USA.

==Sport and culture==
See [[Sport in Ireland]], [[Sport in the United Kingdom]], [[Culture of Ireland]] and [[Culture of the United Kingdom]].

A number of sports are popular throughout the British Isles, the most prominent of which is [[football (soccer)|football]]. While this is organised separately in different national associations, leagues and national teams, it is a common passion in all parts of the islands.

There are several sports popular in [[Ireland]] but not in [[Great Britain]], and vice versa. [[Cricket]], [[hurling]] and [[Gaelic football]] are probably the best examples of this. Cricket, while being very popular in England and Wales, is rare in Scotland and Ireland. Similarly, hurling and Gaelic football, although hugely popular across the island of Ireland and capable of regularly filling the 82,500-capacity [[Croke Park]], the 4th largest stadium in Europe, are almost unknown in Great Britain. 

Some sporting events do operate across Great Britain and Ireland as a whole.

The [[British and Irish Lions]] is a [[rugby union]] team made up of players from the entire archipelago{{Fact|date=October 2007}} which undertakes tours of the Southern Hemisphere rugby playing nations every few years. This team was formerly known as The British Isles or colloquially as "The British Lions", but was renamed as "The British and Irish Lions" in 2001. In rugby one [[Ireland national rugby union team|united team]] represent both Northern Ireland and the Republic. The four national rugby teams from Great Britain and Ireland play each other each year for the [[Triple Crown (Rugby Union)|Triple Crown]]. 

Since 2001 the professional club teams of Ireland, Scotland and Wales compete together in the [[Celtic League (rugby union)|Celtic League]]. Clubs in the English [[Guinness Premiership]] do not participate in the Celtic League.

Between 1927 and 1971 the [[Ryder Cup]] in [[golf]] was played between a United States team and a Great Britain team, although, in practice, a team representing Great Britain and Ireland. In 1973, the team was renamed so that United States faced an official Great Britain and Ireland team. From 1979 onwards this was expanded to include the whole of Europe. [[Bowls]] is also an example of a sport that continues to have a British Isles championship.

The United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland have separate [[television]] and [[radio]] networks, although UK television is widely available and watched in Ireland,<ref> http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/I/htmlI/ireland/ireland.htm </ref> giving people in Ireland a high level of familiarity with cultural matters in Great Britain. Irish television is not widely watched in Great Britain{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.<!--but people do watch RT<U+00C9> in SW Scotland, on occasion-->  British newspapers and magazines are widely available in Ireland and in recent decades have started to produce specific Ireland-orientated editorial copy. Again, as with television, the reverse is not true and Irish newspapers are not widely available in Great Britain.  

[[Public house|Pubs]] and [[beer]] are an important part of social life in all parts of the British Isles.

A few cultural events are organised for the island group as a whole. For example, the [[Costa Book Awards]] are awarded to authors resident in the UK or Ireland. The [[Man Booker Prize]] is awarded to authors from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] or the Republic of Ireland. The [[Mercury Music Prize]] is handed out every year to the best album from a British or Irish musician or group, though other musical awards are considered on a national basis. It is not unusual for British organisations to include Irish people in lists of "Great Britons" or to include Irish authors in collections of "British" literature. [[Seamus Heaney]] made an objection to his inclusion in a 1982 anthology of British poetry by remarking: '''Don<U+2019>t be surprised If I demur, for, be advised My passport<U+2019>s green. No glass of ours was ever raised To toast the Queen''. (Open Letter, Field day Pamphlet no.2 1983)".

Many other bodies are organised throughout the islands as a whole; for example the [[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritans]] which is deliberately organised without regard to national boundaries on the basis that a service which is not political or religious should not recognise sectarian or political divisions.<ref>[http://www.samaritans.org/know/about/history/history_nationalgrowth_popup.shtm Samaritans - Would you like to know more? > History > National growth]</ref> The [[RNLI]] is also organised throughout the islands as a whole, and describes itself as covering the UK and Republic of Ireland.<ref> [http://www.rnli.org.uk/home] The RNLI is a charity that provides a 24-hour lifesaving service around the UK and Republic of Ireland. As a charity, the RNLI relies on your support to carry on saving lives at sea. </ref>
