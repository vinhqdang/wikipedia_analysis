'''Adidas AG''' ({{IPA-de|<U+02C8>adi<U+02CC>das}}) is a German [[multinational corporation]] that designs and manufactures sports shoes, clothing and accessories. The company is based in [[Herzogenaurach]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. It is the [[holding company]] for the Adidas Group, which consists of the [[Reebok]] sportswear company, [[TaylorMade-Adidas]] golf company (including [[Ashworth (clothing)|Ashworth]]),  [[Rockport (company)|Rockport]], and 9.1% of [[FC Bayern Munich]]. Besides sports footwear, Adidas also produces other products such as bags, shirts, watches, eyewear and other sports and clothing-related goods. Adidas is the largest [[sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]] manufacturer in Europe and the second biggest in the world, after [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601100&sid=ah3ZhaeNWMdM&refer=germany |title=Adidas, Deutsche Telekom, Infineon: German Equity Preview |accessdate=26 January 2008 |date=16 January 2008 |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]}}</ref>

Adidas was founded in 1949 by [[Adolf Dassler]], following a family feud at the ''Gebr<U+00FC>der Dassler Schuhfabrik'' company between him and his older brother [[Rudolf Dassler|Rudolf]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.adidas-group.com/en/group/history/ | title=Adidas Group History | publisher=adidas-group.com | accessdate=19 August 2014}}</ref> Rudolf had earlier established [[Puma SE|Puma]], which quickly became the business rival of Adidas. Both the Adidas and Puma companies still remain based in [[Herzogenaurach]], Germany to this day.

The company's clothing and shoe designs typically feature [[three stripes|three parallel bars]], and the same motif is incorporated into Adidas's current official logo.<ref name="smit">{{Cite book | title = Pitch Invasion, Adidas, Puma and the making of modern sport | author=Smit, Barbara | isbn = 0-14-102368-6 | publisher=Penguin | year = 2007 | page = 44}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | title  = International cases in the business of sport | first1=Simon |last1=Chadwick |first2=Dave |last2=Arthur | page = 438 | publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-7506-8543-3 }}</ref> The company revenue for 2012 was listed at [[Euro sign|<U+20AC>]]14.88 billion.<ref name="AR2012" />

==History==
[[File:AdidasStoreVaughanMills.jpg|thumb|An Adidas Store]]

===Early Days===
Christoph Von Wilhelm Dassler was a worker in a shoe factory, while his wife Pauline ran a small laundry in the [[Bavaria]]n town of [[Herzogenaurach]], {{convert|20|km|mi||abbr=on|sigfig=3}} from the city of [[Nuremberg]]. After leaving school, their son, [[Rudolf Dassler|Rudolf "Rudi" Dassler]], joined his father at the shoe factory. When he returned from fighting in [[World War I]], Rudolf received a management position at a [[porcelain]] factory, and later in a leather wholesale business in [[Nuremberg]].

[[Adolf Dassler|Adolf "Adi" Dassler]] started to produce his own sports shoes in his mother's wash kitchen in [[Herzogenaurach]], Bavaria after his return from World War I. In July 1924, his brother Rudolf returned to Herzogenaurach to join his younger brother's business, which became ''{{lang|de|Gebr<U+00FC>der Dassler Schuhfabrik}}'' (''Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory'') and prospered. The pair started the venture in their mother's laundry,<ref name="Sneaker Wars">{{Cite book|last=Smit|first=Barbara|title=Sneaker Wars|publisher=Harper Perennial|year=2009|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-124658-6}}</ref>{{rp|5}} but, at the time, electricity supplies in the town were unreliable, and the brothers sometimes had to use pedal power from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment.<ref name=DW>{{cite web|last=James|first=Kyle|url=http://www.dw.de/the-town-that-sibling-rivalry-built-and-divided/a-2074427 |title=The Town that Sibling Rivalry Built, and Divided |work=Deutsche Welle |date=3 July 2006}}</ref>

By the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], [[Adi Dassler]] drove from Bavaria on one of the world's first motorways to the Olympic village with a suitcase full of spikes and persuaded U.S. [[Sprint (race)|sprinter]] [[Jesse Owens]] to use them, the first [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] for an African American. Following Owens's haul of four gold medals, his success cemented the good reputation of Dassler shoes among the world's most famous sportsmen. Letters from around the world landed on the brothers' desks, and the trainers of other national teams were all interested in their shoes. Business boomed and the Dasslers were selling 200,000 pairs of shoes each year before World War II.<ref name=rediff>{{cite web|url=http://in.rediff.com/sports/2005/nov/08adi.htm |title=How Adidas and PUMA were born |publisher=in.rediff.com |date=8 November 2005|accessdate=2 April 2014}}</ref>

===World War II and company split===
During the war, a growing rift between the pair reached breaking point after an Allied bomb attack in 1943, when Adi and his wife ran into a bomb shelter that Rudolf and his family were already in: "The bastards are back again", Adi said, referring to the Allied war planes, but Rudolf was utterly convinced that his brother had been referring to him and his family.<ref name=sneakerwars>{{cite book|last=Esterl |first=Mike |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120606066903653643.html?mod=googlenews_wsj |title=Review of "Sneaker Wars: The Enemy Brothers Who Founded Adidas and PUMA and the Family Feud That Forever Changed the Business of Sport", Barbara Smit, March 2008, ISBN 978-0-06-124657-9 |work=The Wall Street Journal  |date=21 March 2008 |accessdate=26 September 2010}}</ref> After Rudolf was later picked up by American soldiers and accused of being a member of the [[Waffen SS]], which he was not, he felt certain that his brother had turned him in.<ref name=DW/>

The Dolbury factory, used for production of anti-tank weapons during the war, was nearly destroyed by US forces in April 1945, but was spared when Adi Dassler's wife, K<U+00E4>the, convinced the GIs that the company and its employees were only interested in manufacturing sports shoes.  American occupying forces subsequently became major buyers of the Dassler brothers' shoes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shoes and Nazi Bazookas: The Prehistory of Adidas and Puma|work=Der Spiegel|date=4 March 2009|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/shoes-and-nazi-bazookas-the-prehistory-of-adidas-and-puma-a-611400.html|accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref>

The brothers split up in 1947,<ref name=sneakerwars/> with Rudi forming a new firm that he called '''Ruda''' <U+2013> from '''Ru'''dolf '''Da'''ssler, later rebranded [[Puma SE|Puma]], and Adi forming a company formally registered as '''Adidas AG''' from '''Adi''' '''Das'''sler on 18 August 1949. Although it is a popular [[urban myth]] that the name is an [[acronym]] for ''All Day I Dream About Sports'', that phrase is a [[backronym]]; in reality the name is actually a [[portmanteau]] formed from "Adi" (a nickname for Adolf) and "Das" (from "Dassler").<ref name=history/>

===Early years and rivalry with Puma===
Puma and Adidas entered into a fierce and bitter business rivalry after the split. Indeed, the town of Herzogenaurach was divided on the issue, leading to the nickname "the town of bent necks"<U+2014>people looked down to see which shoes strangers wore.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ramachandran|first=Arjun|title=Town divided by tale of two shoes|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=18 September 2009|url=http://www.smh.com.au/executive-style/culture/town-divided-by-tale-of-two-shoes-20090918-fv01.html|accessdate=6 November 2010}}</ref> Even the town's two [[Football team|football club]]s were divided: [[ASV Herzogenaurach]] club was supported by Adidas, while [[FC Herzogenaurach|1 FC Herzogenaurach]] endorsed Rudolf's footwear.<ref name="DW" /> When handymen were called to Rudolf's home, they would deliberately wear Adidas shoes. Rudolf would tell them to go to the basement and pick out a pair of free Pumas.<ref name="DW" /> Sadly, the two brothers were never reconciled and although both are now buried in the same cemetery, they are spaced apart as far as possible. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In 1948, the first football match after World War II, several members of the [[West Germany national football team|West German national football team]] wore Puma boots, including the scorer of West Germany's first post-war goal, [[Herbert Burdenski]]. Four years later, at the [[1952 Summer Olympics]], [[1500 metres]] runner [[Josy Barthel]] of [[Luxembourg]] won Puma's first Olympic gold in [[Helsinki]], Finland.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
[[File:Logo brand Adidas.png|thumb|right|150px| The original trefoil Adidas logo until 1997, it is now used on [[Adidas Originals]].]]

At the [[1960 Summer Olympics]], Puma paid German sprinter [[Armin Hary]] to wear Pumas in the 100 meter sprint final. Hary had worn Adidas before and asked Adolf for payment, but Adidas rejected this request. The German won gold in Pumas, but then laced up Adidas for the medals ceremony, to the shock of the two Dassler brothers. Hary hoped to cash in from both, but Adi was so enraged he banned the Olympic champion.<ref name=rediff/>

===Tapie affair===
<!-- Please upload a working photo -->
<!-- [[File:Bernard-Tapie.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Bernard Tapie]], a former French businessman who once owned Adidas but has since relinquished his control over the company due to [[debt]]]] -->

{{Refimprove section|date=October 2010}}
After a period of trouble following the death of Adolf Dassler's son [[Horst Dassler]] in 1987, the company was bought in 1989 by French industrialist [[Bernard Tapie]], for [[French franc|<U+20A3>]]1.6 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] (now <U+20AC>243.9&nbsp;million), which Tapie borrowed. Tapie was at the time a famous specialist of rescuing bankrupt companies, an expertise on which he built his fortune.

Tapie decided to move production [[offshoring|offshore]] to Asia. He also hired [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] for promotion.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} He sent, from [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, a shoe sales representative to Germany and met Adolf Dassler's descendants (Amelia Randall Dassler and Bella Beck Dassler) and was sent back with a few items to promote the company there.

In 1992, unable to pay the loan interest, Tapie mandated the [[Cr<U+00E9>dit Lyonnais]] bank to sell Adidas, and the bank subsequently converted the outstanding debt owed into [[Stock|equity]] of the enterprise, which was unusual as per the prevalent French banking practice. The [[state-owned]] bank had tried to get Tapie out of dire financial straits as a personal favour to Tapie, it is reported, because Tapie was [[Political minister|Minister]] of Urban Affairs (ministre de la Ville) in the French government at the time.

In February 1993, Cr<U+00E9>dit Lyonnais sold Adidas to [[Robert Louis-Dreyfus]], a friend of Bernard Tapie for a much higher amount of money than what Tapie owed, 4.485&nbsp;billion (<U+20AC>683.514&nbsp;million) francs rather than 2.85&nbsp;billion (<U+20AC>434.479&nbsp;million). They also purposely bankrupted Tapie's company that owned Adidas, because only the company had the right to sue them.

[[Robert Louis-Dreyfus]] became the new CEO of the company. He was also the president of [[Olympique de Marseille]], a team Tapie had owned until 1993.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Tapie filed for personal bankruptcy in 1994. He was the object of several lawsuits, notably related to [[match fixing]] at the football club. During 1997, he served 6 months of an 18-month prison sentence in [[La Sant<U+00E9>]] prison in Paris.

===Post-Tapie era===
[[File:An Adidas shoe.jpg|thumb|200px|An Adidas "Stan Smith" style shoe, with the company's distinctive [[Three stripes|three parallel bars]]]]
In 1994, combined with [[FIFA]] Youth Group, [[SOS Children's Villages]] became the main beneficiary.

In 1997, Adidas AG acquired the [[Salomon Group]] who specialized in ski wear, and its official corporate name was changed to Adidas-Salomon AG. With this acquisition Adidas also acquired the Taylormade Golf company and [[Maxfli]], which allowed them to compete with Nike Golf.

In 1998, Adidas sued the [[NCAA]] over their rules limiting the size and number of commercial logos on team uniforms and clothing. Adidas withdrew the suit, and the two groups established guidelines as to what three-stripe designs would be considered uses of the Adidas trademark.
[[File:Adidas Running Shoe Demo.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Adidas running shoe product demo for a running club in [[Boston]]]]
In 2003, Adidas filed a lawsuit in a British court challenging Fitness World Trading's use of a two-stripe motif similar to Adidas's [[three stripes]]. The court ruled that despite the simplicity of the mark, ''Fitness World'' 's use was infringing because the public could establish a link between that use and Adidas's mark.<ref>{{cite news |last=Osborn |first=Andrew |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,3604,995976,00.html |title=Adidas told its three stripes don't constitute a trademark |work=The Guardian |date=10 July 2003 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref>

In September 2004, top English fashion designer [[Stella McCartney]] launched a joint-venture line with Adidas, establishing a long-term partnership with the corporation. This line is a sports performance collection for women called "Adidas by Stella McCartney",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adidas.com/campaigns/women/content/stella/stella.asp?strCountry_Adidascom=com |title= Stella McCartney collection |publisher=Adidas.com |accessdate=26 September 2010}}</ref> and it has been critically acclaimed.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0565383/bio Stella McCartney Biography] at [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref>

Also, on May 3, 2005, Adidas told the public that they sold their partner company [[Salomon Group]] for <U+20AC>485m to [[Amer Sports]] of Finland.
In August 2005, Adidas declared its intention to buy British rival [[Reebok]] for $3.8&nbsp;billion (US$). This takeover was completed with partnership in January 2006<ref name=history>[http://www.reebok.com/useng/history/2000.htm Reebok History, 2000<U+2013>]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref> and meant that the company would have business sales closer to those of Nike in North America. The acquisition of Reebok would also allow Adidas to compete with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] worldwide as the number two athletic shoemaker in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aolsvc.news.aol.com/business/article.adp?id=20050803092509990002 |title=AOL.com |publisher=Aolsvc.news.aol.com |accessdate=26 September 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref>

Adidas has global corporate headquarters in Germany, and many other business locations around the world such as Portland OR, Hong Kong, Toronto, Taiwan, England, Japan, Australia, and Spain. Mainly sold in the U.S., Adidas makes lots of assets from these countries and is expanding to more overseas countries.

In 2005, Adidas introduced the [[Adidas 1]], the first ever production shoe to use a [[microprocessor]]. Dubbed by the company "The World's First Intelligent Shoe", it features a microprocessor capable of performing 5 million calculations per second that automatically adjusts the shoe's level of cushioning to suit its environment. The shoe requires a small, user-replaceable battery that lasts for approximately 100 hours of running. On 25 November 2005, Adidas released a new version of the Adidas 1 with an increased range of cushioning, allowing the shoe to become softer or firmer, and a new motor with 153 percent more torque.<ref>[http://www.popularmechanics.com/outdoors/recreation/1278181 Adidas 1 Is The Most Technically Advanced Running Shoe] ''Popular Mechanics'', 7 December 2004</ref>

On April 11, 2006, Adidas announced an 11-year deal to become the official [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] clothing provider.  They will make NBA, [[NBDL]], and [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] jerseys and products as well as team-coloured versions of the "Superstar" basketball shoe.  This deal (worth over $400&nbsp;million) took over the previous Reebok deal that had been put in place in 2001 for 10 years.

On November 2011, Adidas announced that it would acquire outdoor action sport performance brand Five Ten through a share purchase agreement.  The total purchase price was $25 million USD in cash at closing.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.adidas-group.com/en/pressroom/archive/2011/03nov2011_2.aspx |title=adidas Group to acquire outdoor specialist Five Ten |date=3 November 2011 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref>

By the end of 2012, Adidas is reporting the highest revenues ever and Chief Executive Herbert Hainer expresses optimism for the year ahead.<ref name="Dubai">{{cite web |url=http://www.dubaichronicle.com/2012/12/27/sports-gear-maker-scores-highest-revenue/ |title=Sports gear maker scores highest revenue ever in 2012 |work=Dubai Chronicle |date=27 December 2012 |accessdate=27 December 2012}}</ref>

In January 2015, Adidas launched the footwear industry's first reservation mobile app. The Adidas Confirmed app allows consumers to get access to and reserve the brand's limited edition sneakers by leveraging geo targeting technology<ref>Darren Heitner, Forbes. <U+201C>[URL Adidas Launches Footwear Industry's First Reservation Mobile App].<U+201D> February 3, 2015.

On March 24, 2015, Adidas and McDonald's unveiled the 2015 McDonald's All-American uniforms. For the third year in a row, players will be wearing short-sleeved jerseys, made with the same lightweight and breathable material as the ones used in the NBA.<ref>[http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/story/2015-03-24/mcdonalds-all-american-2015-game-uniforms-shoes-adidas-photos Adidas unveils 2015 McDonald's All-American uniforms]</ref>

===[[Association Football]]===

One of the main focuses of Adidas has always been football kit and the associated equipment.
Adidas remains a major company in the supply of team kits for international association football teams and clubs, including [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], [[Real Madrid C.F|Real Madrid]], [[Chelsea F.C|Chelsea]], [[Manchester United]], [[A.C. Milan]] and [[Juventus]] (starting in 2015-16).

Adidas makes referee kits that are used in international competition and by many countries and leagues in the world. The company has been an innovator in the area of footwear for the sport, with notable examples including the 1979 release of the [[Adidas Copa Mundial|Copa
Mundial]] moulded boot used for matches on firm dry pitches. It holds the accolade of the best selling boot of all time. The soft-ground equivalent was named World Cup and it too remains on the market, timeless and iconic.

[[File:2010 World Cup Autographed by the entire Spanish National Team that won the 2010 World Cup.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Adidas sponsored jersey of the [[Spain national football team]]]]

[[FIFA]], the world governing body of football, commissioned specially designed footballs for use in its own [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] tournaments to favour more attacking play. The balls supplied for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], the ''[[Adidas Teamgeist|Teamgeist]]'', were particular noteworthy for their ability to travel further than previous types when struck, leading to longer range goals. Goalkeepers were generally believed to be less comfortable with the design of the ball, claiming it was prone to move significantly and unpredictably in flight.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Michael|title=Official World Cup ball, Jabulani, getting the blame for soft goals - Robert Green - and missed ones |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/official-world-cup-ball-jabulani-blame-soft-goals-robert-green-missed-article-1.182196|accessdate=5 March 2013|newspaper=NY Daily News|date=4 June 2010}}</ref>

Adidas also introduced another new ball for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]]. The [[Adidas Jabulani|Jabulani]] ball was designed and developed by [[Loughborough University]] in conjunction with [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]. It received much criticism from players, managers and pundits for being too hard to control.<ref>{{cite web|title=Adidas Jabulani Review|url=http://www.soccercleats101.com/2010/01/13/jabulani-world-cup-soccer-ball-review/|publisher=SoccerCleats101.com|accessdate=13 January 2010}}</ref> The lighter and more aerodynamic ball led to many shots and passes being over hit.

[[File:Andy murray crop.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Andy Murray]] endorsed Adidas from the start of the 2010 season until the end of the [[2014 Andy Murray tennis season|2014 season]], a period during which he was the company's highest paid individual athlete sponsorship, receiving US$4.9 million per year.]]

Adidas has been involved with tennis equipment since the mid 1960s and has historically sponsored many top tennis players, beginning with two of the most dominant male tennis players at the start of the professional era in the late 1960s, [[Stan Smith]] and [[Ilie Nastase]]. During the 1980s and 1990s, not only were they exclusive apparel and footwear sponsors of world number one men's tennis players [[Ivan Lendl]] and [[Stefan Edberg]] and ladies' world number one [[Steffi Graf]] but each player had their own, exclusive graphic styles designed for their use during play, which were in turn marketed to the general public. Ivan Lendl even spent the vast majority of his dominant career playing with several different models of Adidas tennis racquets, primarily using the legendary Adidas GTX-Pro and then later the Adidas GTX Pro-T. The company recently introduced a new line of tennis [[racquet]]s. While the Feather is made for the "regular player", and the Response for the "club player", Adidas targets the "tournament player" with the 12.2 oz Barricade tour model.<ref>Tennis-warehouse.com</ref> 

Adidas sponsors the following professional players with mainly clothing and footwear: [[Ana Ivanovic]], [[Andy Murray]], [[Maria Kirilenko]], [[Caroline Wozniacki]], [[Justine Henin]], [[Jo-Wilfried Tsonga]], [[Daniela Hantuchov<U+00E1>]], [[Alicia Molik]], [[Fernando Verdasco]], [[Marcos Baghdatis]], [[Gilles Simon]], [[Fernando Gonz<U+00E1>lez]], [[Flavia Pennetta]], [[Laura Robson]], [[Kristina Mladenovic]], [[Francesca Schiavone]], [[Melanie Oudin]], [[Angelique Kerber]], [[Simona Halep]] and [[Sorana C<U+00EE>rstea]]. Adidas tennis clothing contains the ClimaCool technology found in other athletic jerseys and shoes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://adidas.com/us/tennis/ |title=Adidas tennis |publisher=Adidas.com |accessdate=10 April 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100421001958/http://www.adidas.com/us/tennis/| archivedate= 21 April 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

In November 2009, World Number 4 [[Andy Murray]] was confirmed as Adidas's highest paid star with a 5-year contract reported to be worth US$24.5m.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/news/andy_murray_signs_head-to-toe_deal_with_adidas/ |title=Andy Murray signs head-to-toe deal with Adidas |publisher=SportsProMedia |date=4 November 2009|accessdate=10 October 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101025093032/http://www.sportspromedia.com/news/andy_murray_signs_head-to-toe_deal_with_adidas/| archivedate= 25 October 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

Players sponsored by Adidas can take advantage of the Adidas Player Improvement Program, where the company provides coaches, fitness trainers and sports psychologists to players in order to further their careers. The program includes legendary coaches such as [[Darren Cahill]] and [[Sven Groeneveld]].

In [[Cincinnati]], at the [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP Tennis Tournament]] in Mason, they have also sponsored the [[Ball boy#Tennis|ball-boy and ball-girl]] uniforms.

===Golf===
Adidas Golf is part of Adidas, a German-based sports clothing manufacturer and part of the Adidas Group, which consists of [[Reebok]] sportswear company, [[TaylorMade-Adidas]] golf company, and [[Rockport (company)|Rockport]]. The Adidas Group is one of the global leaders in the sporting goods industry offering a wide range of products around the three core segments of Adidas, Reebok, and TaylorMade-Adidas Golf. Adidas Golf sells and manufactures Adidas-brand golf clothing, footwear, and accessories.

====Company timeline====

In 1997, Adidas AG acquired the Salomon Group who specialized in [[Alpine skiing|alpine ski]] wear, and its official corporate name was changed to Adidas-Salomon AG because with this acquisition Adidas also acquired the TaylorMade Golf company and [[Maxfli]], which allowed them to compete with Nike Golf. Salomon sold its controlling interest in TaylorMade and its other sports equipment companies to global giant Adidas AG.

In 1998, Adidas Golf USA moved its business operations from [[Tualatin, Oregon|Tualatin]], Oregon, to the [[Carlsbad, California|Carlsbad]], California headquarters of TaylorMade Golf, acquired by Adidas-Salomon. Adidas Golf USA had thirty employees to relocate. Carlsbad is also the headquarters of one of its primary competitors, [[Callaway Golf Company]].

In 1999, TaylorMade and AdidasGolf USA, were merged into a new company<U+2014>called TaylorMade-Adidas Golf<U+2014>with world headquarters in Carlsbad. Mark King was named president of the company he had begun his career with in 1981 as a sales representative after a short stint as vice president of sales and marketing at Callaway Golf Ball Co. in 1998.

In November 2008, [[Ashworth (clothing)]] became a wholly owned subsidiary of TaylorMade-Adidas Golf, complementary to the synthetic performance fabrics of Adidas Golf.

====Product====

Adidas Golf sells clothing, footwear, and accessories for men, women, and youth. Men's equipment includes footwear, shirts, shorts, pants, outerwear (wind suits), base layer and eyewear,

===Cricket===
[[File:Tendulkar batting against Australia, October 2010 (1), cropped.jpg|thumb|200px|Indian cricketer [[Sachin Tendulkar]], batting with his personalized Adidas Cricket Bat]]

Adidas began manufacturing cricket footwear in the mid 1970s, with their initial target market being Australia. Their shoes were a radical departure from traditional leather cricket boots which had remained basically unchanged for decades, being lighter and more flexible but also offering less toe protection, so that it became not uncommon to see batsmen who had been struck by the ball on the foot hopping around in pain. Having continued to manufacture cricket footwear for many years, in  2006 the company finally entered the field of bat manufacture in 2008 and currently their bat range includes the Pellara, Incurza, Libro and M-Blaster models.

In the 1990s, Adidas signed the superstar Indian batsman [[Sachin Tendulkar]] and made shoes for him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/brand-tendulkar-will-never-lose-value/3801/ |title=<U+2018>Brand Tendulkar will never lose value<U+2019> |work=The Indian Express   |location=India |date=5 May 2006 |accessdate=10 April 2010}}</ref> Tendulkar still wears Adidas shoes while playing matches. Since 2008, Adidas has sponsored the cricket bat used by Tendulkar. It created a new bat, 'Adidas MasterBlaster Elite', personalized for him.

In 2008, Adidas made a concerted move into English cricket market by sponsoring English batting star [[Kevin Pietersen]] after the cancellation of his lifetime deal with [[Woodworm Cricket Company|Woodworm]], when they ran into financial difficulties.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/kevinpietersen/3204505/Kevin-Pietersen-snaps-up-lucrative-bat-deal-after-the-demise-of-Woodworm-Cricket.html |title=Kevin Pietersen snaps up lucrative bat deal after the demise of Woodworm |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=16 October 2008 |accessdate=14 May 2009  | first=Derek | last=Pringle}}</ref> The following year they signed up fellow England player [[Ian Bell]], [[Pakistan cricket team|Pakistan]] opening batsman [[Salman Butt]] and Indian Player [[Ravindra Jadeja]].

Currently the sponsored cricketers include [[Sachin Tendulkar]], [[Rohit Sharma]], [[Suresh Raina]], [[Virat Kohli]], [[Lasith Malinga]], [[Kieron Pollard]] and [[Dwayne Bravo]].

Adidas currently manufactures kit for the [[England cricket team]]. Adidas signed with [[Cricket South Africa]] in 2011 and the kit worn by [[South African Cricket Team]] during and after the [[Cricket World Cup 2011]] will be manufactured by the German giant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adidas.com/za/homepage.asp |title=Pure Proteas <U+2013> Adidas South Africa |publisher=Adidas.com |accessdate=6 May 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110512212050/http://www.adidas.com/za/homepage.asp| archivedate= 12 May 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref>  The [[Australia cricket team]] were previously sponsored by Adidas until late 2011.

====Sandals====
[[File:Adilette sandals 2004.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Several classic Adilette pairs]]

=====Adilette=====
'''Adilette''' was the first ever pair of [[sandals]] made by Adidas, originally developed in 1963.<ref name="History"/> Adidas claims that a group of athletes approached [[Adolf Dassler|Adi Dassler]] requesting a shoe be made for the locker room.

To this day, the resulting sandals are a best-seller.<ref name="History">{{cite web|url=http://www.adidas-group.com/en/ourgroup/assets/History/pdfs/60Years_HistoricalOverview_e.pdf|title=60 years of Adidas|page=5|publisher=Adidas Group|date=February 2010}}</ref> Since the original navy blue and white '''Adilette''' sandals were created nearly fifty years ago, more varieties have been created in different colours (black, red, green, grey, orange, brown, yellow, pink, golden, silver). Most recently, Adidas has introduced a colour scheme that goes along with its Predator and adizero line; the scheme is dubbed warning (orange) and purple. Usually, the three stripes appear in the contrasting colour on the strap of the classic models. The most common adilette livery is in navy blue or black, mixed with white colours. Also the Woodilette and Trefoil models follow a similar design but without stripes on the strap.

The model provides a contoured orthopedic rubber sole with synthetic upper, and was designed as an apr<U+00E8>s-sport [[Slide (footwear)|slide]], but the adilette were quickly used everywhere out of the sporting world. Opting for a wide, over the foot strap rather than the design of [[flip flops]], the adilette sandals provide a fresh style and a different level of comfort for the wearer. The strap is also glued to the sides of the sandal, which directs tension to less stressful areas of the sandal, which gives the sandals more durability.

=====Santiossage=====
The '''Santiossage''' is a uni-sex [[Slide (footwear)|slide]]-style sandal. The sandal has the trademarked three stripes on a velcro strap toward the front of the shoe. [[Santiossage]] comes in black, navy, or red. On the side of the shoe, toward the heel on either side, the manufacturer's name appears, as well as on a round emblem in the actual heel of the foot-bed. Notably, there are tiny clear massage nubs throughout the foot-bed for the purpose of massaging after-sport footaches, although the sandals are worn casually among non-athletes. Seen through these clear nubs are Adidas' three stripes.

=====Adissage=====
[[File:Adissage.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A pair of Adissage]]
'''Adissage''' is also a uni-sex [[Slide (footwear)|slide]]-style sandal. Available in black, navy, light blue, black with pink, and other assorted colors, the sandal has the trademarked three stripes on a [[velcro]] strap toward the front of the shoe. On the side of the shoe, toward the heel on either side, the manufacturers name appears, as well as on a round emblem in the actual heel of the footbed. Like the '''Santiossage''', there are tiny black massage nubs throughout the foot-bed for the purpose of massaging foot aches after sport, although popular as a casual sandal amongst non-athletes as well.

==Marketing==

[[File:Bilbao BUM Chuck D chandal.jpg|Bilbao BUM Chuck D chandal|thumb|[[Chuck D]] in an Adidas sweatsuit|right|200px]]
Adidas, like other sports brands, is believed to engender high consumer brand loyalty. Brand loyalty towards Adidas, [[Nike, Inc.]], [[Puma AG]] and several other sportswear brands was examined in a recent study.<ref>Dawes, J. "Brand Loyalty in the UK Sportswear Market." International Journal of Market Research, Vol 51, No. 1 2009.</ref>  The study found consumers did not exhibit unduly high loyalty towards such brands.

During the mid to late 1990s, Adidas divided the brand into three main groups with each a separate focus: '''Adidas Performance''' was designed to maintain their devotion to the athlete; '''[[Adidas Originals]]''' was designed to focus on the brand's earlier designs which remained a popular life-style icon; and '''Style Essentials''', which dealt with the fashion market; the main group within this being '''Y-3''' (which is a collaboration between Adidas and renowned Japanese fashion designer [[Yohji Yamamoto]] - the Y representing Yamamoto and the 3 representing the three stripes of Adidas).

''"Adidas is all in"'' is the current global marketing strategy slogan for Adidas. The slogan aims to tie all brands and labels together, presenting a unified image to consumers interested in sports, fashion, street, music and pop culture. There appears to be connection with the phrase "all-in" meaning "exhausted" in some English speaking nations.

''"Impossible is Nothing"'' was the previous mainstream marketing [[slogan]] for Adidas. This campaign was developed by 180/TBWA based in Amsterdam but also with significant work being done by [[TBWA\Chiat\Day]] in San Francisco <U+2013> particularly for its basketball campaign "Believe in Five".TBWA\Chiat\Day commissioned Zane Peach<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wolfecontemporary.com/news.htm |title=Mark Wolfe Contemporary Art |publisher=Wolfecontemporary.com |accessdate=10 April 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100419140155/http://www.wolfecontemporary.com/news.htm| archivedate= 19 April 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> to produce images for 2007 international ad campaign.

The brand is featured in several games, including [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]]: ''Daley Thompson's Olympic Challenge'', [[Sony PlayStation]]: ''Adidas power soccer'' and Commodore 64, ZX spectrum, Amstrad CPC: ''[[Adidas Championship Football]]''.

==Criticism==
Adidas's business practises/[[ethics]] and commitment to worker welfare have been scrutinised and often criticised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thetyee.ca/News/2008/06/11/OlympicLabour/ |title=Tyee <U+2013> Homepage |publisher=Thetyee.ca |date=11 June 2008 |accessdate=26 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0308-03.htm |title=News & Views |publisher=Common Dreams |date=8 March 2002 |accessdate=26 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100929193658/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0308-03.htm| archivedate= 29 September 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

===2011 All Blacks replica rugby jersey pricing controversy===
Unhappy with the local price of the Adidas replica All Blacks jersey, New Zealand-based [[All Blacks]] fans have asked for price cuts and begun purchasing the jersey from overseas vendors after it was revealed that the local price of $NZ220 was more than twice the price offered on some websites.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/5410579/Adidas-stands-by-All-Blacks-jersey-price |title=Adidas stands by All Blacks jersey price  |work=The Dominion Post |location=NZ |date=8 August 2011 |accessdate=8 August 2011  | first=Kent | last=Blechynden}}</ref>

Adidas has responded by enforcing cross-border agreements to stop overseas retailers from selling to New Zealand residents.  It has been labelled a public relations disaster by leading New Zealand PR firms and Consumer advocate groups.  The largest New Zealand sportswear retailer [[Rebel Sport]] has stated it is angry and is considering selling the All Blacks Jerseys to the general public below cost.  As of 9 August 2011, Rebel Sport has decided not to stock the Adidas Rugby Union jersey.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=10743045 |title=Adidas stands by All Blacks jersey price |work=The New Zealand Herald|location=NZ |date=5 August 2011 |accessdate=8 August 2011  | first=Michael | last=Dickison}}</ref>

===2012 "shackle" sneakers===
On June 14, 2012, Adidas posted on their Facebook page a picture of a pair of shoes containing shackles. The picture was of a planned shoe line that Adidas intended to release in August. The photo quickly caused controversy including that of [[Jesse Jackson]] who was quoted as saying "The attempt to commercialize and make popular more than 200 years of human degradation, where blacks were considered three-fifths human by our Constitution is offensive, appalling and insensitive".<ref name="Shackles">{{cite news|last=Solomon|first=Jessie|date=19 June 2012|title=Adidas cancels 'shackle' shoes after outcry |work=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/18/us/adidas-shackle-shoes/index.html?hpt=hp_c2|accessdate=19 June 2012}}</ref> Jackson threatened a boycott, and NBA commissioner [[David Stern]] was at one point reportedly contacted in hopes that he would intervene.<ref name="Shackles" /> Shortly after the outcry the company canceled the product.<ref name="Shackles" />

===Sweatshops and labour rights violations===
Adidas has been criticized for operating [[sweatshops]], particularly in Indonesia. Between 2006 and 2007, Adidas rejected many of its suppliers that supported unions for subcontractors with less reputable labour rights records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org.au/explore/workers-rights/adidas |title=Adidas |publisher=[[Oxfam|Oxfam Australia]] |accessdate=11 November 2011}}</ref> By subcontracting work to different suppliers, it is more difficult for Adidas to ensure company labour standards are enforced. Workplace standards that Adidas' policy upholds include the freedom for workers to take part in [[collective bargaining]] and a non-retaliation policy towards workers who express concerns.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.adidas-group.com/en/sustainability/suppliers_and_workers/code_of_conduct/default.aspx |title=Our Workplace Standards |publisher=Adidas |accessdate=11 November 2011}}</ref> In practice, however, many of Adidas' suppliers have not upheld these standards. At the Panarub factory in [[Java]], 33 workers were fired after striking for better pay in 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org.au/explore/workers-rights/adidas/inside-adidas-indonesian-factories#workers |title=Inside Adidas' Indonesian Factories |publisher=[[Oxfam|Oxfam Australia]] |accessdate=11 November 2011}}</ref> PT Kizone is another Indonesian factory where Adidas has received criticism over treatment of workers. They produced products for Adidas as well as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and the [[Dallas Cowboys]] until they closed in January 2011. Laid off were 2,686 workers, who are owed $3 million in severance pay and benefits. Nike has contributed $1.5 million but Adidas has not acted. A campaign has been initiated by United Students Against Sweatshops calling for universities to cut contracts with Adidas.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/24/business/students-object-to-use-of-sweatshop-labor-on-college-clothing.html?pagewanted=all |title=Students Battle a Dallas Cowboys Unit Over College Apparel |work=The New York Times |date=24 September 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011 |first=Steven |last=Greenhouse}}</ref> On 16 July 2012, [[War on Want]] organised activists in London to replace Adidas price tags in sports stores with 34p ones,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waronwant.org/component/content/article/17607 |title=Adidas rocked by price tag protest over workers' rights |date=17 July 2012 |publisher=War on Want |accessdate=27 December 2012}}</ref> a reference to the low hourly wage rate paid to the Indonesian workers who make Adidas goods.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/16843 |title=Adidas criticised for 'sweatshop' Olympic merchandise |date=16 July 2012 |publisher=[[Ekklesia (think tank)|Ekklesia]] |accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref> The campaign group [[Labour Behind the Label]] claimed that the basic pay of Indonesian Adidas workers was only <U+00A3>10 a week. William Anderson, head of social and environmental affairs for the Asia Pacific region, posted an entry on the company blog in which he sought to justify the 34p an hour pay rate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.adidas-group.com/2012/07/%E2%80%9Cpoverty-wages%E2%80%9D-in-the-sporting-goods-industry-what-does-this-mean/#more-6238 |title='Poverty Wages' in the sporting goods industry <U+2013> What does this mean? |last1=Anderson |first1=Bill |date=10 July 2012 |work=adidas Group blog |publisher=Adidas |accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref>

In April 2014, one of the biggest strikes on mainland [[China]] took place at the [[Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings]] Dongguan shoe factory, producing amongst others for Adidas.<ref>[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1486399/yue-yuen-strikers-vow-continue-until-benefit-contribution-deficit-paid Yue Yuen strikers vow to continue until benefit contribution deficit paid in full], South China Morning Post, 2013-04-18.</ref>

For years, Adidas purchased paper for its packaging from [[Asia Pulp & Paper]], the third largest paper producer in the world, which was labeled as a "forest criminal" for destroying "precious habitat" in Indonesia<U+2019>s rainforest.<ref name="Paper Giant Pledges to Leave the Poor Rainforest Alone.
