'''Kazi Nazrul Islam''' ({{lang-bn|<U+0995><U+09BE><U+099C><U+09C0> <U+09A8><U+099C><U+09B0><U+09C1><U+09B2> <U+0987><U+09B8><U+09B2><U+09BE><U+09AE>}}) (born [[May 25]], [[1899]] &mdash; died [[August 29]], [[1976]]) was a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] [[Bengali poetry|poet]], [[Music of Bengal|musician]], [[Revolutionary movement for Indian independence|revolutionary]], and [[philosopher]] who pioneered poetic works espousing intense spiritual rebellion against orthodoxy and oppression. His poetry and nationalist activism earned him the popular title of ''Bidrohi Kobi'' (Rebel Poet). Accomplishing a [[Complete Works of Kazi Nazrul Islam|large body of acclaimed works]] through his life, Nazrul is officially recognised as the [[national poet]] of [[Bangladesh]] and commemorated in [[India]]. 

Born in a poor [[Muslim]] family, Nazrul received religious education and worked as a [[muezzin]] at a local [[mosque]]. He learned of poetry, drama, and literature while working with theatrical groups. After serving in the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]], Nazrul established himself as a journalist in [[Kolkata]] (then Calcutta). He assailed the [[British Raj]] in India and preached revolution through his poetic works, such as "Bidrohi" ("The Rebel") and "Bhangar Gaan" ("The Song of Destruction"), as well as his publication "Dhumketu" ("The Comet"). His impassioned activism in the [[Indian independence movement]] often led to his imprisonment by British authorities. While in prison, Nazrul wrote the "Rajbandir Jabanbandi" ("Deposition of a Political Prisoner") and condemned [[Islamic fundamentalism]], orthodox traditions and bigotry in society. Exploring the life and conditions of the downtrodden masses of India, Nazrul agitated fiercely for their emancipation.  

Nazrul's writings explore themes such as love, freedom, and revolution; he opposed all bigotry, including religious and gender.  Throughout his career, Nazrul wrote short stories, novels, and essays but is best-known for his poems, in which he pioneered new forms such as Bengali [[ghazal]]s. Nazrul wrote and composed music for his nearly 3,000 songs, collectively known as [[Nazrul geeti]] (Nazrul songs), which are widely popular today. At the age of 43 (in 1942) he began suffering from an unknown disease, losing his voice and memory. Suffering from what was later diagnosed as [[Pick's Disease]],<ref name="ILL">{{cite web

Nazrul had two brothers, Kazi Shahebjan and Kazi Ali Hussain, and a sister, Umme Kulsum. Nicknamed ''Dukhu Mia'' ("Sad Man"), Nazrul began attending the ''maktab'' &mdash; the local religious school run by the mosque &mdash; where he studied the [[Qur'an]] and other scripture, Islamic philosophy and theology. His family was devastated with the death of his father in 1908. At the young age of ten, Nazrul began working in his father's place as a caretaker to support his family, as well as assisting teachers in school.

Attracted to folk theatre, Nazrul joined a ''leto'' (travelling theatrical group) run by his uncle Bazle Karim. Working and travelling with them, learning [[acting]], as well as writing songs and poems for the plays and musicals.<ref name="MOF"/> Through his work and experiences, Nazrul began learning Bengali and [[Sanskrit literature]], as well as Hindu scriptures such as the [[Puranas]]. The young poet composed a number of folk plays for his group, which included ''Chasar San'', ''Shakunibadh'', ''Raja Yudhisthirer San'', ''Data Karna'', ''Akbar Badshah'', ''Kavi Kalidas'', ''Vidyabhutum'', ''Rajputrer San'', ''Buda Saliker Ghade Ron'' and ''Meghnad Badh''.<ref name="Banglapedia"/>

In 1910, Nazrul left the troupe and enrolled at the Raniganj Searsole Raj School, and later transferred to the Mathrun High English School, studying under the headmaster and poet [[Kumudranjan Mallik]]. Unable to continue paying his school fees, Nazrul left the school and joined a group of <U+201C>kaviyals<U+201D>. Later he took a jobs as a cook at the house of a [[Christian]] railway guard and at a bakery and tea stall in the town of Asansol. In 1914, Nazrul joined the Darirampur School (now Nazrul University) in [[Trishal]], [[Mymensingh District]]. Amongst other subjects, Nazrul studied Bengali, Sanskrit, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian literature]] and [[Hindustani classical music|classical music]] under teachers who were impressed by his dedication and skill.<ref name="Banglapedia"/>

Studying up to Class X, Nazrul did not appear for the [[matriculation]] pre-test examination, enlisting instead in the Indian Army in 1917. Some historians have conjectured that Nazrul's may have wished to obtain military training with the aim of using it later for pursuing Indian independence.<ref name="MOF"/>
Attached to the 49th [[Bengal Regiment]], he was posted to the [[cantonment]] in [[Karachi]], where he wrote his first prose and poetry. Although he never saw active fighting, he rose in rank from corporal to ''havildar'', and served as [[quartermaster]] for his [[battalion]].<ref name="Banglapedia"/>
During this period, Nazrul read extensively, and was deeply influenced by [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and [[Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay]], as well as the Persian poets [[Hafiz]], [[Rumi]] and [[Omar Khayyam]]. He learnt Persian poetry from the regiment's [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] [[moulvi]], practiced music and pursued his literary interests. His first prose work, "Baunduler Atmakahini" ("Life of a Vagabond") was published in May, 1919.<ref name="MOF"/> His poem "Mukti" ("Freedom") was published by the "Bangla Mussalman Sahitya Patrika" ("Bengali Muslim Literary Journal") in July 1919.<ref name="Banglapedia"/>

Nazrul left the army in 1920 and settled in [[Kolkata]], which was then the ''Cultural capital of India'' (it had ceased to be the political capital in [[1911]]). He joined the staff of the <U+201C>Bangiya Mussalman Sahitya Samiti<U+201D> ("Bengali Muslim Literary Society") and roomed at 32 [[College Street (Kolkata)|College Street]] with colleagues.

Working at the literary society, Nazrul grew close to a rising generation of Muslim writers including Mohammad Mozammel Haq, Afzalul Haq, Kazi Abdul Wadud and [[Muhammad Shahidullah]]. He was a regular at clubs for Calcutta's writers, poets and intellectuals like the Gajendar Adda and the Bharatiya Adda. In October 1921, Nazrul went to [[Santiniketan]] with Muhammad Shahidullah and met Rabindranath Tagore. Despite many differences, Nazrul looked to Tagore as a mentor and the two remained in close association.<ref name="Banglapedia"/> In 1921, Nazrul was engaged to be married to Nargis, the niece of a well-known Muslim publisher Ali Akbar Khan, in Daulatpur, [[Comilla District|Comilla]].

Nazrul catapulted to fame with the publication of "Bidrohi" in 1922, which remains his most famous work. At the time of publication, no other poem since Tagore's "Shonar tori" had met with such spontaneous acclaim and criticism for the radical approach. Set in a heroic meter, this long poem invokes images from [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]], [[Islamic mythology|Muslim]] and [[Greek mythology]].<ref name="Banglapedia"/> Nazrul won admiration of India's literary classes by his description of the rebel whose impact is fierce and ruthless even as its spirit is deep:

Published in the "Bijli" magazine, the poem caused a popular sensation. Nazrul stormed into Tagore's residence, jokingly declaring "Gurudev, I have come to kill you off."

Nazrul followed up by writing "Pralayollas" ("Destructive Euphoria"), and his first anthology of poems, the "Agniveena" ("Lyre of Fire") in 1922, which enjoyed astounding and far-reaching success. He also published his first volume of short stories, the "Byather Dan" ("Gift of Sorrow") and "Yugbani<U+201D>, an anthology of essays.

Earning the moniker of the "rebel poet<U+201D>, Nazrul also aroused the suspicion of British authorities.<ref name="heretic"/> A political poem published in "Dhumketu" in September 1922 led to a police raid on the magazine's office.

On [[April 14]], [[1923]] he was transferred from the jail in [[Alipore]] to [[Hooghly]] in Kolkata, he began a 40-day fast to protest mistreatment by the British jail superintendent. Nazrul broke his fast more than a month later and was eventually released from prison in December 1923. Nazrul composed a large number of poems and songs during the period of imprisonment and many his works were banned in the 1920s by the British authorities.

Kazi Nazrul Islam became a critic of the [[Khilafat Movement|Khilafat struggle]], condemning it as hollow, religious fundamentalism even as thousands of Muslims agitated for it.<ref name="Banglapedia"/> Nazrul's rebellious expression extended to rigid orthodoxy in the name of Islam. While explicitly avowing his affinity to Islam, and calling for upholding Islam for its universalistic essence, values and spirit, he believed that medieval Islamic practices and religious conservatism were hurting Indian Muslims as well as the Muslim world, and keeping them backward, intensifying social and sectarian challenges.<ref name="ISLAM">{{cite web

Nevertheless, he became active in encouraging people to agitate against British rule, and joined the Bengal state unit of the Congress.<ref name="Banglapedia"/> Nazrul also helped organise the [[Sramik Praja Swaraj Dal]], a political party committed to national independence and the service of the peasant masses. On [[December 16]], [[1925]] Nazrul started publishing the weekly "Langal<U+201D>, with himself as chief editor.<ref name="Banglapedia"/> The "Langal" was the mouthpiece of the Sramik Praja Swaraj Dal.

It was during his visit to Comilla in 1921, that Nazrul met a young Hindu woman, Pramila Devi. The two maintained regular correspondence. Falling in love, they married on [[April 25]], [[1924]]. Pramila belonged to the [[Brahmo Samaj]], which criticised her marriage to a Muslim. Nazrul in turn was condemned by Muslim religious leaders and continued to face criticism for his personal life and professional works. As a result, Nazrul's works began intensely attacking social and religious dogma and intolerance. His poems also spoke in philosophical terms of romantic love, and the complete equality of men and women, and attacking the social and religious traditions of the time that ruled otherwise.<ref name="NAZRUL">{{cite web

With his wife and young son Bulbul, Nazrul settled in [[Krishnanagar]] in 1926. His work began to transform as he wrote poetry and songs that articulated the aspirations of the downtrodden masses.<ref name="NAZRUL"/> Nazrul assailed the socio-economic norms and political system that had brought upon misery. The songs of Nazrul, giving voice to the aspirations of the masses, have come to be known as "mass music". His major poems include "Daridro" ("Poverty"):

Nazrul professed faith in the belief in the absolute equality of women &mdash; a view his contemporaries considered revolutionary. In his poem "Naree" ("Women"), Nazrul repudiates what he sees as the long-standing oppression of women, proclaiming their equality:

While vivid in his account of the woman's torment, Nazrul has been criticized in modern times for not exploring the possibility that a woman's life may reach beyond wifely duties.

Nazrul's mother died in 1928, and his second son Bulbul died of [[smallpox]] the following year. His first son, Krishna Mohammad had died prematurely. His wife gave birth to two more sons &mdash; Savyasachi in 1928 and Aniruddha in 1931 &mdash; but Nazrul remained shaken and aggrieved for a long time. His works changed significantly from rebellious expositions of society to deeper examination of religious themes. His works in these years led Islamic devotional songs into the mainstream of [[Bengali music|Bengali folk music]], exploring the Islamic practices of ''[[namaz]]'' (prayer), ''[[roza]]'' (fasting), ''[[hajj]]'' (pilgrimage) and ''[[zakat]]'' (charity).

Nazrul assailed fanaticism in religion, denouncing it as evil and inherently irreligious. He devoted many works to expound upon the principle of human equality, exploring the ''[[Qur'an]]'' and the life of Islam's prophet [[Muhammad]]. Nazrul has been compared to [[William Butler Yeats]] for being the first Muslim poet to create imagery and symbolism of Muslim historical figures such as Qasim, [[Ali]], [[Umar]], [[Mustafa Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk|Kamal Pasha]], Anwar Pasha and the prophet [[Muhammad]].<ref name="sedition">{{cite web

==Later life and illness==
[[Image:Kazi Nazrul 1930s.png|thumb|left|200px|Nazrul, in the 1930s]]
In 1933, Nazrul published a collection of essays titled "Modern World Literature", in which he analyses different styles and themes of literature. Nazrul identifies two main literary trends &mdash; the first demonstrates passionate devotion to [[Earth]] with the exploration of the home environment of human beings; the second attempts to rise above and out of Earth to explore and reach the heavens.<ref name="NAZRUL">{{cite web

}}</ref> Between 1928 and 1935 he published 10 volumes containing 800 songs of which more than 600 were based on classical ''[[ragas]]''. Almost 100 were folk tunes after ''[[kirtans]]'' and some 30 were patriotic songs. From the time of his return to Kolkata until he fell ill in 1941, Nazrul composed more than 2,600 songs, many of which have been lost.<ref name="MOF2">{{cite web

}}</ref> He also wrote poetry, songs and stories for children, seeking to inspire the thirst for knowledge, the spirit of freedom and independent thinking. 

Nazrul's success soon brought him into Indian theatre and the nascent [[Cinema of India|film industry]]. The first picture for which he worked was based on [[Girish Chandra Ghosh]]'s story "Bhakta Dhruva" in 1934. Nazrul acted in the role of [[Narada]] and directed the film.  He also composed songs for it, directed the music and served as a [[playback singer]].<ref name="Banglapedia">{{cite web

Nazrul wrote songs and directed music for [[Sachin Sengupta]]'s bioepic play ''[[Siraj-ud-Daula]]''. In 1939, Nazrul began working for Calcutta Radio, supervising the production and broadcasting of the station's musical programmes. He produced critical and analytic documentaries on music, such as ''Haramoni'' and ''Navaraga-malika''. Nazrul also wrote a large variety of songs inspired by the [[raga]] ''Bhairav''.<ref name="NAZRUL">{{cite web

While enjoying commercial success, Nazrul sought to preserve his artistic integrity by condemning the adaptation of his songs to music composed by others and insisting on the use of tunes he composed himself.

Nazrul's wife Pramila Devi fell seriously ill in 1939 and was paralysed from waist down. To provide for his wife's medical treatment, he sold his property as well as copyrights and royalties he received for his works.<ref name="heretic">{{cite web

Nazrul also was shaken by the death of Rabindranath Tagore on [[August 8]], [[1941]]. He spontaneously composed two poems in Tagore's memory, one of which, "Rabihara" (loss of Rabi or without Rabi) was broadcast on the [[All India Radio]]. Within months, Nazrul himself fell seriously ill and gradually began losing his power of speech. His behaviour became erratic, and spending recklessly, he fell into financial difficulties. Embittered by the sudden loss of his active life, Nazrul wrote in a letter to his friend Zulfikar Haider on [[July 17]], [[1942]]: 
[[Image:Kazi Nazrul circa 1974.png|thumb|right|250px|Nazrul in [[Bangladesh]], circa 1974]]
{{cquote|... I am bed-ridden due to blood pressure. I am writing with great difficulty. My home is filled with worries &mdash; illness, debt, creditors; day and night I am struggling....

In spite of her own predicament his wife constantly cared for her husband. However, Nazrul's health seriously deteriorated and he grew increasingly depressed. He underwent medical treatment under [[homeopathy]] as well as [[Ayurveda]], but little progress was achieved before mental dysfunction intensified and he was admitted to a mental asylum in 1942. Spending four months there without making progress, Nazrul and his family began living a silent life in India. In 1952, he was transferred to a mental hospital in [[Ranchi]]. With the efforts of a large group of admirers who called themselves the "Nazrul Treatment Society" as well as prominent supporters such as the Indian politician [[Syama Prasad Mookerjee]], the poet travelled to [[London]] for treatment.<ref name="NAZRUL">{{cite web

In 1972, the newly independent nation of Bangladesh obtained permission from the [[Government of India]] to bring Nazrul to live in Dhaka and accorded him honorary citizenship.<ref name="Banglapedia" /> Despite receiving treatment and attention, Nazrul's physical and mental health did not improve. In 1974, his youngest son, Kazi Aniruddha, an eminent guitarist died, and Nazrul soon succumbed to his long-standing ailments on [[August 29]], [[1976]]. In accordance with a wish he had expressed in one of his poems, he was buried beside a mosque on the campus of the [[University of Dhaka]]. Tens of thousands of people attended his funeral.

Nazrul's poetry is characterized by an abundant use of rhetorical devices, which he employed to convey conviction and sensuousness. He often wrote without care for organization or polish. His works have often been criticized for [[egotism]], but his admirers counter that they carry more a sense of self-confidence than ego. They cite his ability to defy God yet maintain an inner, humble devotion to Him.<ref name="sedition">{{cite web
