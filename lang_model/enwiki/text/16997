}} {{Campaignbox English Civil War}}{{History of England}}
The '''English Civil War''' (1642<U+2013>1651) was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] ([[Roundhead]]s) and [[Cavalier|Royalists]] ([[Cavalier]]s). The [[First English Civil War|first]] (1642<U+2013>46) and [[Second English Civil War|second]] (1648<U+2013>49) civil wars pitted the supporters of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] against the supporters of the [[Long Parliament]], while the [[Third English Civil War|third war]] (1649<U+2013>51) saw fighting between supporters of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and supporters of the [[Rump Parliament]]. The Civil War ended with the Parliamentary victory at the [[Battle of Worcester]] on 3 September 1651.

The English Civil War led to the trial and [[execution of Charles I]], the exile of his son, Charles II, and replacement of [[English monarchy]] with, first, the [[Commonwealth of England]] (1649<U+2013>53), and then with a [[The Protectorate|Protectorate]] (1653<U+2013>59), under [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s personal rule. The monopoly of the [[Church of England]] on Christian worship in England ended with the victors consolidating the established [[Protestant Ascendancy]] in Ireland. Constitutionally, the wars established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without Parliament's consent, although this concept was legally established only with the [[Glorious Revolution]] later in the century.

==Terminology==
The term ''English Civil War'' appears most commonly in the singular form, although historians often divide the conflict into two or three separate wars. Although the term describes events as impinging on England, from the outset the conflicts involved wars with and civil wars within both Scotland and Ireland; see [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] for an overview.

Unlike other [[List of English civil wars|civil wars in England]], which focused on who ruled, this war also concerned itself with the manner of governing the three kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]]. The [[1911 Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]] called the series of wars the Great Rebellion, while some historians, especially [[Marxist]]s such as [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] (1912<U+2013>2003), have long favoured the term [[English Revolution]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hill|1972|loc=for example}}.</ref>

==Background==
===The King's Rule===
War broke out less than fifty years after the death of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1603. At the accession of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1625, England and Scotland had both experienced relative peace, both internally and in their relations with each other, for as long as anyone could remember. Charles hoped to unite the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland into a new single kingdom, fulfilling the dream of his father, [[James VI of Scotland and I of England]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Croft|2003|p=63}}.</ref> Many English Parliamentarians had suspicions regarding such a move, because they feared that setting up a new kingdom might destroy the old English traditions which had bound the English monarchy. As Charles shared his father's position on the power of the crown (James had described kings as "little Gods on Earth", chosen by God to rule in accordance with the doctrine of the "[[Divine Right of Kings]]"), the suspicions of the Parliamentarians had some justification.<ref>{{Harvnb|McClelland|1996|p=224}}.</ref>

===Parliament in the English constitutional framework===
Before the fighting, the [[Parliament of England]] did not have a large permanent role in the English system of government, functioning as a temporary advisory committee, summoned by the monarch whenever the Crown required additional tax revenue, and subject to dissolution by the monarch at any time. Because responsibility for collecting taxes lay in the hands of the [[gentry]], the English kings needed the help of that stratum of society in order to ensure a continued stream of revenue. If the gentry refused to collect the King's taxes, the Crown would lack any practical means with which to compel them. Parliaments allowed representatives of the gentry to meet, confer and send policy-proposals to the monarch in the form of Bills. These representatives did not, however, have any means of forcing their will upon the king<U+2014>except by withholding the financial means required to execute his plans.<ref>William Dawson Johnston, [http://www.archive.org/details/historyenglandf01johngoog The history of England from the accession of James the Second] Volume I, Boston and New York, Houghton, Mifflin and company, 1901. <!--[http://books.google.com/books?id=-z4YAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA88&dq=%22Petition+of+Right%22&ei=q3aLSuTQCpCqkASF4N2ECg#v=onepage&q=%22Petition%20of%20Right%22&f=false]--> {{Page needed|date=September 2009}}</ref>

===Parliamentary concerns and the Petition of Right===
[[Image:Sir Peter Lely 001.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], painted by [[Peter Lely]], 1660]]
One event to raise concerns over Charles's reign was his marriage to a Roman Catholic, French princess [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], in 1625, directly after ascending the throne.<ref name=Gregg-73>{{Harvnb|Gregg|1984|p=73}}.</ref> Charles's marriage raised the possibility that his children, including an heir to the throne, might grow up Catholic, an alarming prospect for officially Protestant England, where the [[Church of England]] is led by the [[Supreme Governor]], investing the Head of Church in the same person as the Head of State, in this instance the King.<ref name=Gregg-73/>

Charles was keen to intervene on the Protestant side of the [[Thirty Years' War]] that was currently engulfing Europe.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gregg|1984|p=123}}.</ref> Foreign wars necessitated heavy expenditures, and the Crown could raise taxes only through Parliamentary consent. Charles experienced further financial difficulty when his first Parliament refused to assign him the traditional right to collect customs duties for his entire reign, deciding instead to grant it only on a provisional basis and negotiate with him.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gregg|1984|pp=129<U+2013>30}}.</ref>

Charles, meanwhile, decided to send an expeditionary force to relieve the French [[Huguenots]] whom French royal troops held besieged in [[La Rochelle]]. Military support for Protestants on the Continent was, in itself, popular both in Parliament and with the Protestant majority in general,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and it had the potential to alleviate concerns brought about by the King's marriage to a Catholic. However, Charles's insistence on having his unpopular royal favourite [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers, the Duke of Buckingham]] assume command of the English force undermined that support. Unfortunately for Charles and Buckingham, the relief expedition proved a fiasco (1627),<ref>{{Harvnb|Gregg|1984|p=166}}.</ref> and Parliament, already hostile to Buckingham for his monopoly on [[Patronage|royal patronage]], opened [[impeachment]] proceedings against him.<ref name=Gregg-175>{{Harvnb|Gregg|1984|p=175}}.</ref> Charles responded by dissolving Parliament. This move, while saving Buckingham, reinforced the impression that Charles wanted to avoid Parliamentary scrutiny of his ministers.<ref name=Gregg-175/>

Having dissolved Parliament and unable to raise money without it, the king assembled a new one in 1628. (The elected members included [[Oliver Cromwell]] and [[Edward Coke]].) The new Parliament drew up the [[Petition of Right]], and Charles accepted it as a concession in order to obtain his subsidy.<ref name="Purkiss 2007 93">{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=93}}.</ref> Amongst other things, the Petition referred to [[Magna Carta]].<ref>[[Petition of Right]] at III, VII.</ref>

===Personal rule===
Charles I avoided calling a Parliament for the next decade, a period known as the "[[personal rule of Charles I]]", or the "Eleven Years' Tyranny".<ref>{{Harvnb|Rosner|Theibault|2000|p=103}}.</ref> During this period, Charles' lack of money determined policies. First and foremost, to avoid Parliament the King needed to avoid war. Charles made peace with France and Spain, effectively ending England's involvement in the [[Thirty Years' War]]; however that in itself was far from enough to balance the Crown's finances.

Unable to raise revenue through Parliament <U+2013> and unwilling to convene it <U+2013> Charles resorted to other means. For example not observing some conventions (often long-outdated) became a finable offence (for example, a failure to attend and to receive [[knighthood]] at Charles' coronation), with the fine paid to the Crown. The King also tried to raise revenue through the [[ship money]] tax, by exploiting a naval war-scare in 1635, demanding that the inland English counties pay the tax for the [[Royal Navy]]. Established law supported this policy, but authorities had ignored it for centuries, and many regarded it as yet another extra-Parliamentary (and therefore illegal) tax.<ref name=Pipes-143>{{Harvnb|Pipes|1999|p=143}}.</ref> Some prominent men refused to pay ship money arguing that the tax was illegal, but they lost in court and the fines imposed on them for refusing to pay ship money (and for standing against the tax's legality) aroused widespread indignation.<ref name=Pipes-143/>

During the "Personal Rule," Charles aroused most antagonism through his religious measures: he believed in [[Anglican|High Anglicanism]], a sacramental version of the [[Church of England]], theologically based upon [[Arminianism]], a creed shared with his main political advisor, Archbishop [[William Laud]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Carlton|1987|p=48}}.</ref> In 1633, Charles appointed Laud as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and started making the Church more ceremonial, replacing the wooden [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|communion]] tables with stone altars.<ref>{{Harvnb|Carlton|1987|p=96}}.</ref> Puritans accused Laud of reintroducing Catholicism; when they complained, he had them arrested. In 1637 [[John Bastwick]], [[Henry Burton (Puritan)|Henry Burton]], and [[William Prynne]] had their ears cut off for writing pamphlets attacking Laud's views<U+2014>a rare penalty for [[Gentleman|gentlemen]], and one that aroused anger.<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=201}}.</ref> Moreover, the Church authorities revived the statutes passed in the time of [[Elizabeth I]] about church attendance, and fined Puritans for not attending Anglican church services.<ref>{{Harvnb|Carlton|1987|p=173}}.</ref>

===Rebellion in Scotland===
{{Main|Bishops' War}}
The end of Charles' independent governance came when he attempted to apply the same religious policies in Scotland. The [[Church of Scotland]], reluctantly Episcopal in structure, had independent traditions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=74}}.</ref> Charles, however, wanted one uniform Church throughout Britain<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=83}}.</ref> and introduced a new, High Anglican version of the English [[Book of Common Prayer]] to Scotland in summer of 1637. This was violently resisted; a riot broke out in Edinburgh,<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=75}}.</ref> which may have been started in a church by [[Jenny Geddes]].  In February 1638, the Scots formulated their objections to royal policy in the [[National Covenant]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=77}}.</ref> This document took the form of a "loyal protest", rejecting all innovations not first having been tested by free parliaments and General Assemblies of the Church.

In the spring of 1639, King Charles I accompanied his forces to the Scottish border to end the rebellion known as the [[Bishops' War]].<ref name=Purkiss-96>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=96}}.</ref> But, after an inconclusive military campaign, he accepted the offered Scottish truce <U+2013> the [[Pacification of Berwick]]. The truce proved temporary and a second war followed in summer of 1640. This time, a Scots army defeated Charles' forces in the north, then captured [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=97}}.</ref> Charles eventually agreed not to interfere with Scotland's religion and paid the Scots' war-expenses.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

===Recall of the English Parliament===
Charles needed to suppress the rebellion in Scotland. He had insufficient funds, however, and needed to seek money from a newly elected [[Short Parliament|English Parliament]] in 1640.<ref name=Coward-180>{{Harvnb|Coward|2003|p=180}}.</ref> The majority faction in the new Parliament, led by [[John Pym]], took this appeal for money as an opportunity to discuss grievances against the Crown and opposed the idea of an English invasion of Scotland. Charles took exception to this ''[[lese majesty|l<U+00E8>se-majest<U+00E9>]]'' (offence against the ruler) and dissolved the Parliament after only a few weeks; hence the name "the [[Short Parliament]]".<ref name=Coward-180/>

Without Parliament's support, Charles attacked Scotland again, breaking the truce at Berwick, and suffered a comprehensive defeat. The Scots then seized the opportunity and invaded England, occupying [[Northumberland]] and [[Durham]].<ref name=Coward-180/> Meanwhile, another of Charles' chief advisors, [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Thomas Wentworth, 1st Viscount Wentworth]], had risen to the role of Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1632<ref name=Purkiss-89>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=89}}.</ref> and brought in much-needed revenue for Charles by persuading the Irish Catholic gentry to pay new taxes in return for promised religious concessions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Coward|2003|p=172}}.</ref>

In 1639, Charles recalled Wentworth to England and in 1640 made him Earl of Strafford, attempting to have him work his magic again in Scotland.<ref name=Purkiss-89/> This time he proved less successful and the English forces fled the field in their second encounter with the Scots in 1640.<ref name=Purkiss-89/> Almost the entirety of Northern England was occupied and Charles was forced to pay <U+00A3>850 per day to keep the Scots from advancing. If he did not, they would "take" the money by pillaging and burning the cities and towns of Northern England.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sharp|2000|p=13}}.</ref>

All this put Charles in a desperate financial position. As King of Scots, he had to find money to pay the Scottish army in England; as King of England, he had to find money to pay and equip an English army to defend England. His means of raising English revenue without an English Parliament fell critically short of achieving this.<ref name="Purkiss 2007 93"/> Against this backdrop, and according to advice from the [[Magnum Concilium]] (the [[House of Lords]], but without the [[House of Commons of England|Commons]], so not a Parliament), Charles finally bowed to pressure and summoned another English Parliament in November 1640.<ref name=Purkiss-96/>

===The Long Parliament===
{{Main|Long Parliament}}
[[Image:LongParliament.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Session of the Long Parliament]]
The new Parliament proved even more hostile to Charles than its predecessor. It immediately began to discuss grievances against Charles and his Government, and with Pym and [[John Hampden|Hampden]] (of [[ship money]] fame) in the lead, took the opportunity presented by the King's troubles to force various reforming measures<U+2014>including many with strong 'anti-Papist' themes<U+2014>upon him.<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|pp=104,5}}.</ref> The legislators passed a law which stated that a new Parliament should convene at least once every three years<U+2014>without the King's summons, if necessary. Other laws passed by the Parliament made it illegal for the king to impose taxes without Parliamentary consent, and later, gave Parliament control over the king's ministers. Finally, the Parliament passed a law forbidding the King to dissolve it without its consent, even if the three years were up. Ever since, this Parliament has been known as the "Long Parliament". However, Parliament did attempt to avert conflict by requiring all adults to sign [[Protestation of 1641|The Protestation]], an oath of allegiance to Charles.<ref>See {{Harvnb|Walter|1999|p=294}}, for some of the complexities of how the Protestation was interpreted by different political actors.</ref>

Early in the Long Parliament's proceedings the house overwhelmingly accused the Earl of Strafford of high treason, and other crimes and misdemeanors.   Evidence supplied indirectly by [[Henry Vane the Elder]] through his son Sir. [[Henry Vane the Younger]] in relation to Strafford's alleged improper use and threat to England via the Irish army was not corroborated by [[Henry Vane the Elder]].  [[Henry Vane the Elder]] was on the King's Privy council and loyal to the King. On 10 April Pym's case collapsed, but Pym made a direct apeal to the [[Henry Vane the Younger]] to produce a copy of the notes from the King's Privy council, discovered by the younger Vane and secretly turned over to Pym, to the great anguish of the Elder Vane. <ref>Upham p. 187</ref>  These notes or minutes from the King's Privy Council contained evidence that Lord Stafford had told the King, "Sir, you have done your duty, and your subjects have failed in theirs; and therefore you are absolved from the rules of government, and may supply yourself by extraordinary ways; you have an army in Ireland, with which you may reduce the kingdom."<ref name=Upham187>Upham 1842, p. 187.</ref>  <ref>Hibbert, 151</ref><ref>Gillespie, 130.</ref>  Parliament as representatives of the people felt betrayed.

Strafford was considered guilty of raising an Irish army to reduce England for the purpose of generating revenues and abolishing English freedoms.  Pym immediately launched a Bill of Attainder, stating Strafford's guilt and that the Earl be put to death.<ref>Carlton, 224</ref>Unlike a guilty finding in a court case, attainder did not require a [[legal burden of proof]], but it did require [[Royal Assent|the king's approval]]. Charles, however guaranteed Strafford that he would not sign the attainder, without which the bill could not be passed.<ref name="Carlton, 225">Carlton, 225</ref> Furthermore, the Lords were opposed to the severity of the sentence of death imposed upon Strafford. Yet, increased tensions and [[First Army Plot|a plot]] in the army to support of Strafford began to sway the issue.<ref name="Carlton, 225"/> On 21 April,  the Commons passed the Bill (204 in favour, 59 opposed, and 250 abstained),<ref name="Smith, 123">Smith, 123</ref> the Lords acquiesced. Charles, still incensed over the Commons' handling of Buckingham, refused. Wentworth himself, hoping to head off the war he saw looming, wrote to the king and asked him to reconsider.<ref name=Abbott>{{cite web |first=Jacob |last=Abbott |url=http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=abbott&book=charles1&story=_contents |title=Charles I |chapter=Chapter: Downfall of Strafford and Laud |chapterurl=http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=abbott&book=charles1&story=downfall}}</ref> Charles, fearing for the safety of his family, signed on 10 May.<ref name="Smith, 123"/>  The Earl of Strafford was beheaded two days later.<ref>Coward, 191</ref> 

The King himself being thereby implicated, the Long Parliament passed the [[Triennial Act]] also known as the [[Dissolution Act]] in May 1641, to which the Royal Assent was readily granted.<ref>Carlton, 222</ref><ref name="Kenyon, 127">Kenyon, 127</ref>. In the meantime both Parliament and the King agreed to an independent investigation of the king's involvement in Strafford's plot. This [[Triennial Act]] required that Parliament was to be summoned at least once every three years, and that when the King failed to issue proper summons, the members could assemble on their own.  This act also forbade without Parliament's consent, Ship money, fines in destraint of knighthood and forced loans were declared unlawful, monopolies were cut back severely, and the Courts of [[Star Chamber]] and [[Court of High Commission|High Commission]] were abolished by the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1640]] and the [[Triennial Acts|Triennial Act 1641]].<ref>Gregg, 335</ref> The very doctrine of modern freedoms, have to some degree, their origins in these acts.  All remaining forms of taxation were legalised and regulated by the Tonnage and Poundage Act.<ref>Kenyon, 129</ref> On 3 May, Parliament decreed [[Protestation of 1641|The Protestation]], attacking the 'wicked counsels' of Charles's government, whereby those who signed the petition undertook to defend 'the true reformed religion', parliament, and the king's person, honour and estate. Throughout May, the House of Commons launched several bills attacking bishops and episcopalianism in general, each time defeated in the Lords.<ref>Kenyon, 130</ref><ref>Jacob Abbott ''[http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=abbott&book=charles1&story=_contents Charles I]'' Chapter ''[http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=abbott&book=charles1&story=downfall Downfall of Strafford and Laud]''</ref>

Instead of saving the country from war, Wentworth's sacrifice in fact doomed it to one. Within months, the Irish Catholics, fearing a resurgence of Protestant power, [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|struck first]], and all Ireland soon descended into chaos.<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|pp=109<U+2013>113}}.</ref> Rumours circulated that the King supported the Irish, and Puritan members of the Commons soon started murmuring that this exemplified the fate that Charles had in store for them all.<ref>See {{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=113}} for the concerns of a similar English Catholic rising.</ref>

In early January 1642, accompanied by 400 soldiers, Charles attempted to arrest five members of the House of Commons on a charge of treason.<ref name=Sherwood-1997-41>{{Harvnb|Sherwood|1997|p=41}}.</ref> This attempt failed. When the troops marched into Parliament, Charles enquired of [[William Lenthall]], the [[List of Speakers of the House of Commons of England|Speaker]], as to the whereabouts of the five. Lenthall replied "May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here."<ref name=Sherwood-1997-41/> In other words, the Speaker proclaimed himself a servant of Parliament, rather than of the King.<ref name=Sherwood-1997-41/>

===Local grievances===
In the summer of 1642 these national troubles helped to polarise opinion, ending indecision about which side to support or what action to take. Opposition to Charles also arose owing to many local grievances. For example, the imposition of drainage-schemes in [[The Fens]] negatively affected the livelihood of thousands of people after the King awarded a number of drainage-contracts.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hughes|1991|p=127}}.</ref> Many regarded the King as worse than insensitive, and this played a role in bringing a large part of eastern England into Parliament<U+2019>s camp. This sentiment brought with it people such as the [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Earl of Manchester]] and Oliver Cromwell, each a notable wartime adversary of the King. Conversely, one of the leading drainage contractors, the [[Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey|Earl of Lindsey]], was to die fighting for the King at the [[Battle of Edgehill]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=180}}.</ref>

==The First English Civil War==
[[Image:English civil war map 1642 to 1645.JPG|thumb|220px|Maps of territory held by Royalists (red) and Parliamentarians (green), 1642<U+2014>1645]]
{{Main|First English Civil War}}
In early January 1642, a few days after his failure to capture five members of the House of Commons, fearing for his own personal safety and for that of his family and retinue, Charles left the London area.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=57}}.</ref> Further negotiations by frequent correspondence between the King and the Long Parliament through to early summer proved fruitless. As the summer progressed, cities and towns declared their sympathies for one faction or the other: for example, the garrison of Portsmouth under the command of Sir [[George Goring, Lord Goring|George Goring]] declared for the King,<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=107}}.</ref> but when Charles tried to acquire arms for his cause from [[Kingston upon Hull]], the depository for the weapons used in the previous Scottish campaigns, Sir [[John Hotham]], the military governor appointed by Parliament in January, initially refused to let Charles enter Hull,<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=82}}.</ref> and when Charles returned with more men, [[Siege of Hull (1642)|drove them off]].<ref name="Wedgwood 1970 100">{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=100}}.</ref> Charles issued a warrant for Hotham to be arrested as a traitor but was powerless to enforce it. Throughout the summer months, tensions rose and there was brawling in a number of places, with the first death of the conflict taking place in Manchester.<ref name="Wedgwood 1970 100"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Royle|2006|pp=158<U+2013>166}}.</ref>

At the outset of the conflict, much of the country remained neutral, though the [[Royal Navy]] and most English cities favoured Parliament, while the King found considerable support in rural communities. Historians estimate that between them, both sides had only about 15,000 men{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. However, the war quickly spread and eventually involved every level of society. Many areas attempted to remain neutral, some formed bands of [[Clubmen]] to protect their localities against the worst excesses of the armies of both sides,<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|pp=403,4}}.</ref> but most found it impossible to withstand both the King and Parliament. On one side, the King and his supporters thought that they fought for traditional government in Church and state. On the other, most supporters of the Parliamentary cause initially took up arms to defend what they thought of as the traditional balance of government in Church and state, which the bad advice the King had received from his advisers had undermined before and during the "Eleven Years' Tyranny". The views of the Members of Parliament ranged from unquestioning support of the King <U+2013> at one point during the First Civil War, more members of the Commons and Lords gathered in the King's [[Oxford Parliament (1644)|Oxford Parliament]] than at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] <U+2013> through to radicals, who wanted major reforms in favour of [[Nonconformism|religious independence]] and the redistribution of power at the national level.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}<!--For the whole paragraph--> However, even the most radical supporters of the Parliamentarian cause still favoured the retention of Charles on the throne.

After the debacle at Hull, Charles moved on to [[Nottingham]], where on 22 August 1642, he raised the [[Royal Standard of England|royal standard]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=111}}.</ref> When he raised his standard, Charles had with him about 2,000 cavalry and a small number of Yorkshire infantry-men, and using the archaic system of a [[Commission of Array]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=96}}.</ref> Charles' supporters started to build a larger army around the standard. Charles moved in a south-westerly direction, first to [[Stafford]], and then on to [[Shrewsbury]], because the support for his cause seemed particularly strong in the [[River Severn|Severn]] valley area and in [[North Wales]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Royle|2006|pp=170,183}}.</ref> While passing through [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], in what became known as the "[[Wellington Declaration]]", he declared that he would uphold the "Protestant religion, the laws of England, and the liberty of Parliament".<ref>{{harvnb|Sherwood|1992|p=6}}.</ref>
[[Image:Battle of Marston Moor, 1644.png|left|thumb|The [[Battle of Marston Moor]], 1644]]
The Parliamentarians who opposed the King had not remained passive during this pre-war period. As in the case of Kingston upon Hull they had taken measures to secure strategic towns and cities, by appointing men sympathetic to their cause, and on 9 June they had voted to raise an army of 10,000 volunteers, appointing [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex]] commander three days later.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|pp=108,9}}.</ref> He received orders "to rescue His Majesty's person, and the persons of the [[Charles II of England|Prince [of Wales]]] and the [[James II of England|Duke of York]] out of the hands of those desperate persons who were about them".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1993|p=65}}.</ref> The [[Lord Lieutenant|Lords Lieutenant]], whom Parliament appointed, used the [[Militia Ordinance]] to order the militia to join Essex's army.<ref>{{Harvnb|Royle|2006|pp=165,161}}.</ref>

Two weeks after the King had raised his standard at Nottingham, Essex led his army north towards [[Northampton]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=113}}.</ref> picking up support along the way (including a detachment of [[Cambridgeshire]] cavalry raised and commanded by [[Oliver Cromwell]]).<ref>Cromwell had already secured Cambridge and the supplies of college silver <U+2013> see {{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=106}}.</ref> By the middle of September Essex's forces had grown to 21,000 infantry and 4200 cavalry and dragoons. On 14 September he moved his army to [[Coventry]] and then to the north of the [[Cotswolds]],<ref>Wegwood, p.115.</ref> a strategy which placed his army between the Royalists and London. With the size of both armies now in the tens of thousands, and only Worcestershire between them, it was inevitable that cavalry reconnaissance units would sooner or later meet. This happened in the first major skirmish of the Civil War, when a cavalry troop of about 1,000 Royalists commanded by [[Prince Rupert]], a German nephew of the King and one of the outstanding cavalry commanders of the war,<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=148}}.</ref> defeated a Parliamentary cavalry detachment under the command of Colonel [[John Brown (soldier)|John Brown]] in the [[Battle of Powick Bridge]], at a bridge across the [[River Teme]] close to [[Worcester]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Royle|2006|pp=171<U+2013>188}}.</ref>

[[Image:Rupert of the Rhine.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]]]]
Rupert withdrew to Shrewsbury, where a council-of-war discussed two courses of action: whether to advance towards Essex's new position near Worcester, or to march along the now opened road towards London. The Council decided to take the London route, but not to avoid a battle, for the Royalist generals wanted to fight Essex before he grew too strong, and the temper of both sides made it impossible to postpone the decision. In the [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Earl of Clarendon's]] words: "it was considered more counsellable to march towards London, it being morally sure that Essex would put himself in their way".<ref name=EB11-GR>[[Encyclopaedia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] Great Rebellion</ref> Accordingly, the army left Shrewsbury on 12 October, gaining two days' start on the enemy, and moved south-east. This had the desired effect, as it forced Essex to move to intercept them.<ref name=EB11-GR/>

The first [[pitched battle]] of the war, fought at [[Battle of Edgehill|Edgehill]] on 23 October 1642, proved inconclusive, and both the Royalists and Parliamentarians claimed it as a victory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|pp=130,1}}.</ref> The second field action of the war, the stand-off at [[Turnham Green (Battle)|Turnham Green]], saw Charles forced to withdraw to [[Oxford]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=135}}.</ref> This city would serve as his base for the remainder of the war.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|pp=167<U+2013>8;506<U+2013>7}}.</ref>

In 1643 the Royalist forces won at [[Battle of Adwalton Moor|Adwalton Moor]], and gained control of most of [[Yorkshire]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=209}}.</ref> In the Midlands, a Parliamentary force under [[Sir John Gell, 1st Baronet|Sir John Gell]] besieged and captured the cathedral city of [[Lichfield]], after the death of the original commander, Lord Brooke.<ref name=Wanklyn-74>{{Harvnb|Wanklyn|Jones|2005|p=74}}.</ref> This group subsequently joined forces with Sir John Brereton to fight the inconclusive [[Battle of Hopton Heath]] (19 March 1643), where the Royalist commander, the [[Earl of Northampton]], was killed.<ref name=Wanklyn-74/> Subsequent battles in the west of England at [[Battle of Lansdowne|Lansdowne]] and at [[Battle of Roundway Down|Roundway Down]] also went to the Royalists.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wanklyn|Jones|2005|p=103}}.</ref> Prince Rupert could then take [[Bristol]].

With their assistance, he won a victory at the [[Battle of Gainsborough]] in July.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|Holmes|1974|p=151}}.</ref>

In general, the early part of the war went well for the Royalists. The turning point came in the late summer and early autumn of 1643, when the Earl of Essex's army forced the king to raise the [[siege of Gloucester]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=232}}.</ref> and then brushed the Royalist army aside at the [[First Battle of Newbury]] (20 September 1643),<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=238}}.</ref> in order to return triumphantly to London. Other Parliamentarian forces won the [[Battle of Winceby]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=248}}.</ref> giving them control of [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]]. Political manoeuvering to gain an advantage in numbers led Charles to negotiate a ceasefire in Ireland, freeing up English troops to fight on the Royalist side in England,<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|pp=298,9}}.</ref> while Parliament offered concessions to the Scots in return for aid and assistance.

With the help of the Scots, Parliament won at [[Battle of Marston Moor|Marston Moor]] (2 July 1644),<ref>{{Harvnb|Wanklyn|Jones|2005|p=189}}.</ref> gaining [[York]] and the north of England.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=322}}.</ref> Cromwell's conduct in this battle proved decisive,<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=319}}.</ref> and demonstrated his potential as both a political and an important military leader.

In 1645 Parliament reaffirmed its determination to fight the war to a finish. It passed the [[Self-denying Ordinance]], by which all members of either House of Parliament laid down their commands, and re-organized its main forces into the [[New Model Army]] ("Army"), under the command of Sir [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Baron Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas Fairfax]], with Cromwell as his second-in-command and [[Lieutenant General|Lieutenant-General]] of Horse.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=373}}.</ref> In two decisive engagements<U+2014>the [[Battle of Naseby]] on 14 June and the [[Battle of Langport]] on 10 July<U+2014>the Parliamentarians effectively destroyed Charles' armies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=428}}.</ref>

In the remains of his English realm Charles attempted to recover a stable base of support by consolidating the [[English Midlands|Midlands]]. He began to form an axis between Oxford and [[Newark on Trent]] in Nottinghamshire. Those towns had become fortresses and showed more reliable loyalty to him than to others. He took [[Leicester]], which lies between them, but found his resources exhausted. Having little opportunity to replenish them, in May 1646 he sought shelter with a Presbyterian Scottish army at [[Southwell, Nottinghamshire|Southwell]] in Nottinghamshire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|pp=519<U+2013>520}}.</ref>  Charles was eventually handed over to the English Parliament by the Scots and was imprisoned.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=570}}.</ref> This marked the end of the First English Civil War.

==The Second English Civil War==
{{Main|Second English Civil War}}
[[Image:Lastseefather.jpg|thumb|"And when did you last see your father?" by [[William Frederick Yeames]].]]
Charles I took advantage of the deflection of attention away from himself to negotiate a secret treaty with the Scots, again promising church reform, on 28 December 1647.<ref name=Seel-64>{{Harvnb|Seel|1999|p=64}}.</ref>  Under the agreement, called the "[[Engagers|Engagement]]", the Scots undertook to invade England on Charles' behalf and restore him to the throne on condition of the establishment of Presbyterianism for three years.<ref name="Luminarium">{{Cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/encyclopedia/kingcharles.htm |title=King Charles I |publisher=[[Luminarium Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=8 April 2010}}</ref>

A series of Royalist uprisings throughout England and a Scottish invasion occurred in the summer of 1648. Forces loyal to Parliament<ref>{{harvnb|Fairax|1648|loc=Letter}}.</ref> put down most of the uprisings in England after little more than skirmishes, but uprisings in Kent, Essex and Cumberland, the rebellion in Wales, and the Scottish invasion involved the fighting of pitched battles and prolonged sieges.<ref name=Seel-64/>

In the spring of 1648 unpaid Parliamentarian troops in Wales changed sides. Colonel [[Thomas Horton (soldier)|Thomas Horton]] defeated the Royalist rebels at the [[Battle of St Fagans]] (8 May)<ref>{{Harvnb|John|2008|p=127}}.</ref> and the rebel leaders surrendered to Cromwell on 11 July after the protracted two-month [[siege of Pembroke]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Trevelyan|2002|p=274}}.</ref> [[Sir Thomas Fairfax]] defeated a Royalist uprising in Kent at the [[Battle of Maidstone]] on 1 June. Fairfax, after his success at [[Maidstone]] and the pacification of [[Kent]], turned northward to reduce [[Essex]], where, under their ardent, experienced and popular leader Sir [[Charles Lucas]], the Royalists had taken up arms in great numbers. Fairfax soon drove the enemy into [[Colchester]], but his first attack on the town met with a repulse and he had to settle down to [[siege of Colchester|a long siege]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Trevelyan|2002|pp=274,5}}.</ref>

In the North of England, Major-General [[John Lambert (General)|John Lambert]] fought a very successful campaign against a number of Royalist uprisings<U+2014>the largest that of Sir [[Marmaduke Langdale]] in [[Cumberland]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Newman|2006|p=87}}.</ref> Thanks to Lambert's successes, the Scottish commander, the [[James Hamilton, 3rd Marquess and 1st Duke of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton]], had perforce to take the western route through [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] in his pro-Royalist Scottish invasion of England.<ref name=Newman-89>{{Harvnb|Newman|2006|p=89}}.</ref> The Parliamentarians under Cromwell engaged the Scots at the [[Battle of Preston (1648)|Battle of Preston]] (17<U+2013>19 August). The battle took place largely at [[Walton-le-Dale]] near [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in Lancashire, and resulted in a victory by the troops of Cromwell over the Royalists and Scots commanded by Hamilton.<ref name=Newman-89/> This Parliamentarian victory marked the end of the Second English Civil War.

Nearly all the Royalists who had fought in the First Civil War had given their parole not to bear arms against the Parliament, and many honourable Royalists, like [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Lord Astley]], refused to break their word by taking any part in the second war. So the victors in the Second Civil War showed little mercy to those who had brought war into the land again. On the evening of the surrender of Colchester, Parliamentarians had Sir [[Charles Lucas]] and Sir [[George Lisle]] shot.<ref>{{Harvnb|Trevelyan|2002|p=275}}.</ref> Parliamentary authorities sentenced the leaders of the Welsh rebels, Major-General [[Rowland Laugharne]], Colonel [[John Poyer]] and Colonel [[Rice Powel]]<!--Some sources use Powell--> to death, but executed Poyer alone (25 April 1649), having selected him by lot.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gardiner|2006|p=46}}.</ref> Of five prominent Royalist peers who had fallen into the hands of Parliament, three, the Duke of Hamilton, the [[Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland|Earl of Holland]], and [[Arthur Capell, 1st Baron Capell of Hadham|Lord Capel]], one of the Colchester prisoners and a man of high character, were beheaded at Westminster on 9 March.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gardiner|2006|p=12}}.</ref>

==Trial of Charles I for treason==
The betrayal by Charles caused Parliament to debate whether to return the King to power at all. Those who still supported Charles' place on the throne tried once more to negotiate with him.<ref>{{Harvnb|Aylmer|1980|p=23}}.</ref> Furious that Parliament continued to countenance Charles as a ruler, the Army marched on Parliament and conducted "[[Pride's Purge]]" (named after the commanding officer of the operation, [[Thomas Pride]]) in December 1648.<ref>{{Harvnb|Aylmer|1980|p=22}}.</ref> Troops arrested 45 Members of Parliament and kept 146 out of the chamber.

===Ireland===
{{See also|Cromwellian conquest of Ireland}}
[[Image:Massacre at Drogheda.jpeg|thumb|160px|A 19th century representation of the Massacre at Drogheda, 1649]]
Ireland had known continuous war since the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|rebellion of 1641]], with most of the island controlled by the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Confederates]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Leniham|2008|p=121}}.</ref> Increasingly threatened by the armies of the English Parliament after Charles I's arrest in 1648, the Confederates signed a treaty of alliance with the English Royalists.<ref>{{Harvnb|Leniham|2008|p=122}}.</ref> The joint Royalist and Confederate forces under [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde|the Duke of Ormonde]] attempted to eliminate the Parliamentary army holding [[Dublin]], but their opponents routed them at the [[Battle of Rathmines]] (2 August 1649).<ref>{{Harvnb|Leniham|2008|p=127}}.</ref> As the former Member of Parliament [[Admiral Robert Blake]] blockaded Prince Rupert's fleet in [[Kinsale]], Oliver Cromwell could land at [[Dublin]] on 15 August 1649 with an army to quell the Royalist alliance in Ireland.<ref name=Leniham-128>{{Harvnb|Leniham|2008|p=128}}.</ref>

Cromwell's suppression of the Royalists in Ireland during 1649 still has a strong resonance for many Irish people. After the [[siege of Drogheda]],<ref name=Leniham-128/> the massacre of nearly 3,500 people<U+2014>comprising around 2,700 Royalist soldiers and 700 others, including civilians, prisoners, and Catholic priests (Cromwell claimed all the men carrying arms)<U+2014>became one of the historical memories that has driven Irish-English and Catholic-Protestant strife during the last three centuries.  The [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarian]] conquest of Ireland ground on for another four years until 1653, when the last [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Confederate]] and Royalist troops surrendered.<ref>{{Harvnb|Leniham|2008|p=132}}.</ref>  The victors confiscated almost all Irish Catholic-owned land in the wake of the conquest and distributed it to the Parliament's creditors, to the Parliamentary soldiers who served in Ireland, and to English people who had settled there before the war.<ref>{{Harvnb|Leniham|2008|pp=135<U+2013>6}}.</ref>

===Scotland===
{{See also|Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms}}
The execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] altered the dynamics of [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|the Civil War in Scotland]], which had raged between Royalists and [[Covenanter]]s since 1644. By 1649, the struggle had left the Royalists there in disarray and their erstwhile leader, the [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Marquess of Montrose]], had gone into exile. At first, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] encouraged Montrose to raise a Highland army to fight on the Royalist side.<ref name=Carpenter-145>{{Harvnb|Carpenter|2005|p=145}}.</ref> However, when the Scottish Covenanters (who did not agree with the execution of Charles I and who feared for the future of [[Presbyterianism]] and [[Scottish independence]] under the new [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]) offered him the crown of Scotland, Charles abandoned Montrose to his enemies. However, Montrose, who had raised a [[mercenary]] force in Norway,<ref name=Carpenter-145/> had already landed and could not abandon the fight. He did not succeed in raising many Highland clans and the Covenanters defeated his army at the [[Battle of Carbisdale 1650|Battle of Carbisdale]] in [[Ross-shire]] on 27 April 1650. The victors captured Montrose shortly afterwards and took him to [[Edinburgh]]. On 20 May the Scottish Parliament sentenced him to death and had him hanged the next day.<ref name=Carpenter-146>{{Harvnb|Carpenter|2005|p=146}}.</ref>

[[Image:Cromwell at Dunbar Andrew Carrick Gow.jpg|thumb|right|"Cromwell at Dunbar", by [[Andrew Carrick Gow]]]]
Charles II landed in Scotland at [[Garmouth]] in [[Morayshire]] on 23 June 1650<ref>{{Harvnb|Brett|2008|p=39}}.</ref> and signed the 1638 [[National Covenant]] and the 1643 [[Solemn League and Covenant]] shortly after coming ashore.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brett|2008|p=41}}.</ref> With his original Scottish Royalist followers and his new Covenanter allies, King Charles II became the greatest threat facing the new English republic. In response to the threat, Cromwell left some of his lieutenants in Ireland to continue the suppression of the Irish Royalists and returned to England.<ref name=Carpenter-146/>

He arrived in Scotland on 22 July 1650<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|Turner|2004|p=18}}.</ref> and proceeded to lay siege to Edinburgh. By the end of August disease and a shortage of supplies had reduced his army, and he had to order a retreat towards his base at [[Dunbar]]. A Scottish army, assembled under the command of [[David Leslie (Scottish general)|David Leslie]], tried to block the retreat, but Cromwell defeated them at the [[Battle of Dunbar (1650)|Battle of Dunbar]] on 3 September.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|Turner|2004|loc=p.}}{{Page needed|date=May 2010}}.</ref> Cromwell's army then took Edinburgh, and by the end of the year his army had occupied much of southern Scotland.

In July 1651, Cromwell's forces crossed the [[Firth of Forth]] into [[Fife]] and defeated the Scots at the [[Battle of Inverkeithing]] (20 July 1651).<ref>{{Harvnb|Carpenter|2005|p=158}}.</ref> The New Model Army advanced towards [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], which allowed Charles, at the head of the Scottish army, to move south into England. Cromwell followed Charles into England, leaving [[George Monck]] to finish the campaign in Scotland. Monck took [[Stirling]] on 14 August and [[Dundee]] on 1 September.<ref>{{Harvnb|Carpenter|2005|p=185}}.</ref> The next year, 1652, saw the mopping up of the remnants of Royalist resistance, and under the terms of the "[[Tender of Union]]", the Scots received 30 seats in a united Parliament in London, with General Monck appointed as the military governor of Scotland.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dand|1972|p=20}}.</ref>

===England===
Although Cromwell's New Model Army had defeated a Scottish army at Dunbar, Cromwell could not prevent Charles II from marching from Scotland deep into England at the head of another Royalist army.<ref name=Weiser-01>{{Harvnb|Weiser|2003|p=1}}.</ref> The Royalists marched to the west of England because English Royalist sympathies were strongest in that area, but although some English Royalists joined the army, they came in far fewer numbers than Charles and his Scottish supporters had hoped. Cromwell finally engaged and defeated the new king at [[Battle of Worcester|Worcester]] on 3 September 1651.<ref name="Carpenter-145"/> [[Escape of Charles II|Charles II escaped]], via safe houses and a famous [[Royal Oak (tree)|oak tree]], to France, ending the civil wars.<ref name=Weiser-01/>

==Political control==
During the Wars, the Parliamentarians established a number of successive committees to oversee the war-effort. The first of these, the [[English Committee of Safety|Committee of Safety]], set up in July 1642, comprised 15 Members of Parliament.<ref>{{harvnb|Plant|2009|loc=}}. {{better source|date=July 2012}}</ref> Following the [[England|Anglo]]-Scottish alliance against the Royalists, the [[Committee of Both Kingdoms]] replaced the Committee of Safety between 1644 and 1648.<ref name=Kennedy-96>{{Harvnb|Kennedy|2000|p=96}}.</ref> Parliament dissolved the Committee of Both Kingdoms when the alliance ended, but its English members continued to meet and became known as the [[Derby House Committee]].<ref name=Kennedy-96/> A second Committee of Safety then replaced that committee.

===Episcopacy during the English Civil War===
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2012}}
[[File:William Laud.jpg|thumb|[[William Laud]], Charles I's Archbishop of Canterbury.]]
During the period of the English Civil War, the role of bishops as wielders of political power and as upholders of the [[established church]] became a matter of heated political controversy. [[John Calvin]] formulated a doctrine of [[Presbyterianism]], which held that in the New Testament the offices of ''presbyter'' and ''episkopos'' were identical; he rejected the doctrine of [[apostolic succession]]. Calvin's follower [[John Knox]] brought Presbyterianism to [[Scotland]] when the Scottish church was reformed in 1560. In practice, Presbyterianism meant that committees of lay elders had a substantial voice in church government, as opposed to merely being subjects to a ruling [[hierarchy]].

This vision of at least partial [[democracy]] in [[ecclesiology]] paralleled the struggles between [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] and [[List of English monarchs|the King]]. A body within the [[Puritan]] movement in the [[Church of England]] sought to abolish the office of bishop and remake the Church of England along Presbyterian lines. The [[Martin Marprelate]] tracts, applying the [[pejorative]] name of ''[[prelate|prelacy]]'' to the church hierarchy, attacked the office of bishop with satire that deeply offended [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and her [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[John Whitgift]]. The [[vestments controversy]] also related to this movement, seeking further reductions in church ceremony, and labelling the use of elaborate vestments as "unedifying" and even [[idolatry and Christianity|idolatrous]].

[[James I of England|King James I]], reacting against the perceived contumacy of his Presbyterian Scottish subjects, adopted "No Bishop, no King" as a slogan; he tied the hierarchical authority of the bishop to the absolute authority he sought as king, and viewed attacks on the authority of the bishops as attacks on his own authority. Matters came to a head when King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] appointed [[William Laud]] as the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]; Laud aggressively attacked the Presbyterian movement and sought to impose the full [[Book of Common Prayer|Anglican liturgy]]. The controversy eventually led to Laud's [[impeachment]] for [[treason]] by a [[bill of attainder]] in 1645, and subsequent execution. Charles also attempted to impose episcopacy on Scotland; the Scots' violent rejection of bishops and liturgical worship sparked the [[Bishops' Wars]] in 1639<U+2013>1640.

During the height of Puritan power in [[Commonwealth of England|the Commonwealth]] and [[the Protectorate]], episcopacy was formally abolished in the Church of England on 9 October 1646.{{sfn|King|1968|p=523<U+2013>537}} The Church of England remained Presbyterian until the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of the monarchy with [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1660.<ref>{{harvnb|Plant|2002|loc=}}. {{better source|date=July 2012}}</ref>

==Casualties==
As usual in wars of this era, disease caused more deaths than combat. There are no accurate figures for these periods, and it is not possible to give a precise overall figure for those killed in battle, as opposed to those who died from disease, or even from a natural decline in population.

Figures for casualties during this period are unreliable, but some attempt has been made to provide rough estimates.<ref>{{harvnb|White|2012|loc=}}. {{better source|date=July 2012}}</ref><ref name=Carlton-211-214>{{Harvnb|Carlton|1992|loc=[http://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9&ots=R_1h4VBt52&dq=Going+to+the+Wars&lr=&sig=jeEvvoXbdxT3_3ioIDjDA7GWqwQ#PPA211,M1 pp. 211 <U+2013> 214]}}.</ref>
In England, a conservative estimate is that roughly 100,000 people died from war-related disease during the three civil wars. Historical records count 84,830 dead from the wars themselves. Counting in accidents and the two Bishops' wars, an estimate of 190,000 dead is achieved,<ref name=Carlton-211>{{Harvnb|Carlton|1992|loc=[http://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9&ots=R_1h4VBt52&dq=Going+to+the+Wars&lr=&sig=jeEvvoXbdxT3_3ioIDjDA7GWqwQ#PPA211,M1 p. 211]}}.</ref> out of a total population of about five million.<ref name=James-187>{{Harvnb|James|2003|p=187}} cites: {{Harvnb|Carlton|1995|p=212}}.</ref>

Figures for Scotland are more unreliable and should be treated with greater caution. Casualties include the deaths of prisoners-of-war in conditions that accelerated their deaths, with estimates of 10,000 prisoners not surviving or not returning home (8,000 captured during and immediately after the [[Battle of Worcester]] were deported to [[New England]], [[Bermuda]] and the [[West Indies]] to work for landowners as [[indentured labour]]ers<ref>{{Harvnb|Royle|2006|p=602}}.</ref>). There are no figures to calculate how many died from war-related diseases, but if the same ratio of disease to battle deaths from English figures is applied to the Scottish figures, a not unreasonable estimate of 60,000 people is achieved,<ref name=Carlton-212>{{Harvnb|Carlton|1992|loc=[http://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9&ots=R_1h4VBt52&dq=Going+to+the+Wars&lr=&sig=jeEvvoXbdxT3_3ioIDjDA7GWqwQ#PPA212,M1 p. 212]}}.</ref> from a population of about one million.<ref name=James-187/>

Figures for Ireland are described as "miracles of conjecture". Certainly the devastation inflicted on Ireland was unbelievable, with the best estimate provided by Sir William Petty, the father of English demography. Petty estimates that 112,000 Protestants were killed through [[Black Death|plague]], war and [[famine]], and that 504,000 Catholics were killed, giving an estimated total of 618,000 dead,<ref name=Carlton-213>{{Harvnb|Carlton|1992|loc=[http://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9&ots=R_1h4VBt52&dq=Going+to+the+Wars&lr=&sig=jeEvvoXbdxT3_3ioIDjDA7GWqwQ#PPA213,M1 p. 213]}}.</ref> from a pre-war population of about one and a half million.<ref name=James-187/> Although Petty's figures are the best available, they are still acknowledged as being tentative; they do not include the estimate of 40,000 driven into exile, some of whom served as soldiers in European continental armies, while others were sold as indentured servants to New England and the West Indies. Many of those sold to landowners in New England eventually prospered, but many of those sold to landowners in the West Indies were worked to death.

These estimates indicate that England suffered a 3.7% loss of population, Scotland a loss of 6%, while Ireland suffered a loss of 41% of its population. Putting these numbers into the context of other catastrophes helps to understand the devastation to Ireland in particular. The [[Great Hunger]] of 1845<U+2013>1852 resulted in a loss of 16% of the population, while during the Second World War the population of the Soviet Union fell by 16%.<ref name=Carlton-214>{{Harvnb|Carlton|1992|loc=[http://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9&ots=R_1h4VBt52&dq=Going+to+the+Wars&lr=&sig=jeEvvoXbdxT3_3ioIDjDA7GWqwQ#PPA214,M1 p. 214]}}.</ref>

Ordinary people took advantage of the dislocation of civil society during the 1640s to derive advantages for themselves. The contemporary guild democracy movement won its greatest successes among London's transport workers, notably the Thames [[watermen]].<ref>{{Citation|first=Christopher |last=O'Riordan |year=2001|url=http://geocities.com/englishrevolution/workers.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091026215834/http://geocities.com/englishrevolution/workers.htm |archivedate =26 October 2009 |title=Self-determination and the London Transport Workers in the Century of Revolution}}. {{Self-published inline|date=July 2012}}</ref> Rural communities seized timber and other resources on the sequestrated estates of royalists and Catholics, and on the estates of the royal family and the church hierarchy.

==Aftermath==
The wars left England, Scotland, and Ireland among the few countries in Europe without a monarch. In the wake of victory, many of the ideals (and many of the idealists) became sidelined. The republican government of the [[Commonwealth of England]] ruled England (and later all of Scotland and Ireland) from 1649 to 1653 and from 1659 to 1660. Between the two periods, and due to in-fighting amongst various factions in Parliament, [[Oliver Cromwell]] ruled over [[the Protectorate]] as [[Lord Protector]] (effectively a military dictator) until his death in 1658.<ref>See {{Harvnb|Sherwood|1997|pp=7<U+2013>11}} for a longer analysis of the relationship between Cromwell's position, the former monarchy and the military.</ref>

Upon his death, Oliver Cromwell's son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]] became Lord Protector, but the Army had little confidence in him.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keeble|2002|p=6}}.</ref> After seven months the Army removed Richard, and in May 1659 it re-installed the Rump.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keeble|2002|p=9}}.</ref> However, since the Rump Parliament acted as though nothing had changed since 1653 and as though it could treat the Army as it liked, military force shortly afterwards dissolved this, as well.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keeble|2002|p=12}}.</ref> After the second dissolution of the Rump, in October 1659, the prospect of a total descent into anarchy loomed as the Army's pretence of unity finally dissolved into factions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keeble|2002|p=34}}.</ref>
[[File:Musket volley by Sealed Knot.JPG|thumb|A historical civil war re-enactment]]
Into this atmosphere General [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|George Monck]], Governor of Scotland under the Cromwells, marched south with his army from Scotland. On 4 April 1660, in the [[Declaration of Breda]], [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] made known the conditions of his acceptance of the Crown of England.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keeble|2002|p=31}}.</ref> Monck organised the [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Keeble|2002|p=48}}.</ref> which met for the first time on 25 April 1660. On 8 May 1660, it declared that King Charles II had reigned as the lawful monarch since the execution of Charles I in January 1649. Charles returned from exile on 23 May 1660. On 29 May 1660, the populace in London acclaimed him as king.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lodge|2007|pp=5,6}}.</ref> His coronation took place at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 23 April 1661. These events became known as the ''[[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lodge|2007|p=6}}.</ref>

Although the monarchy was restored, it was still only with the consent of Parliament;  therefore, the civil wars effectively set England and Scotland on course to adopt a [[parliamentary monarchy]] form of government.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lodge|2007|p=8}}.</ref> This system would result in the outcome that the future [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], formed in 1707 under the [[Act of Union 1707|Acts of Union]], would manage to forestall the kind of often-bloody revolution, typical of European republican movements that followed the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] revolution in 18th century France and the later success of [[Napoleon]], which generally resulted in the total abolition of monarchy. It was no coincidence that the United Kingdom was spared the wave of revolutions that occurred in Europe in the 1840s. Specifically, future monarchs became wary of pushing Parliament too hard, and Parliament effectively chose the line of royal succession in 1688 with the [[Glorious Revolution]] and in the 1701 [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]]. After the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], Parliament's factions became political parties (later becoming the [[Tory|Tories]] and [[Whig (UK)|Whigs]]) with competing views and varying abilities to influence the decisions of their monarchs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}<!--For the whole paragraph-->

==Historiography and explanations of the English Civil War==
In the early decades of the 20th century the [[Whig history|Whig school]] was the dominant theoretical view. They explained the Civil War as resulting from a centuries-long struggle between Parliament (especially the House of Commons) and the Monarchy, with Parliament defending the traditional rights of Englishmen, while the Stuart monarchy continually attempted to expand its right to arbitrarily dictate law. The most important Whig historian, [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner|S.R. Gardiner]], popularised the English Civil War as a 'Puritan Revolution': challenging the repressive Stuart Church, and preparing the way for [[religious toleration]] in the Restoration. Thus, Puritanism was the natural ally of a people preserving their traditional rights against arbitrary monarchical power.

The Whig view was challenged and largely superseded by the [[Marxism|Marxist]] school, which became popular in the 1940s, and which interpreted the English Civil War as a [[bourgeois]] revolution. According to Marxist historian [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]]:

{{quote|The Civil War was a class war, in which the despotism of Charles I was defended by the reactionary forces of the established Church and conservative landlords, Parliament beat the King because it could appeal to the enthusiastic support of the trading and industrial classes in town and countryside, to the yeomen and progressive gentry, and to wider masses of the population whenever they were able by free discussion to understand what the struggle was really about.|Christopher Hill<ref>{{Harvnb|Kaye|1995|loc=[http://books.google.com/books?id=w6xVLvqihBoC&pg=PA106&hl=en&ei=5dICTMP1BM6TkAWVioS2DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 106]}} quoting Hill from his pamphlet ''The English Revolution 1640''</ref>}}

In the 1970s, a new generation of historians, who would become known as [[historical revisionism|Revisionists]] challenged both the Whig and the Marxist theories.<ref name=Burgess>{{harvnb|Burgess|1990|pp=609<U+2013>627}}.</ref> In 1973, a group of revisionist historians published the anthology ''The Origins of the English Civil War'' ([[Conrad Russell]] ed.). These historians disliked both Whig and Marxist explanations of the Civil War as long-term socio-economic trends in English society, producing work focused on the minutiae of the years immediately preceding the civil war, thereby returning to the contingency-based historiography of [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Clarendon's]] famous contemporary history ''History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England''. This, it was claimed, demonstrated that factional war-allegiance patterns did not fit either Whig or Marxist history.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaunt|2000|p=60}}.</ref> Parliament was not inherently progressive with the events of the 1640 a precursor for the [[Glorious Revolution]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaunt|2000|pp=60, 61}}.</ref> or that Puritans, for example, did not necessarily ally themselves with Parliamentarians.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}  Many members of the bourgeoisie fought for the King, while many landed aristocrats supported Parliament. Thus, revisionist historians claim to have discredited some Whig and Marxist interpretations of the English Civil War .<ref name=Burgess/>{{Failed verification|date=June 2008}}

[[Jane Ohlmeyer]] discarded and replaced the historical title "English Civil War" with the titles the "Wars of the Three" and the "British Civil Wars", positing that the civil war in England cannot be understood isolated from events in other parts of Great Britain and Ireland; King Charles I remains crucial, not just as King of England, but also because of his relationship with the peoples of his other realms. For example, the wars began when King Charles I tried imposing an Anglican Prayer Book upon Scotland, and when this was met with resistance from the [[Covenanter]]s, he needed an army to impose his will. However, this forced him to call an English Parliament to raise new taxes to pay for the army. The English Parliaments were not willing to grant Charles the revenue he needed to pay for the Scottish expeditionary army unless he addressed their grievances. By the early 1640s, Charles was left in a state of near permanent crisis management; often he was not willing to concede enough ground to any one faction to neutralise the threat, and in some circumstances to do so would only antagonise another faction. For example, Charles finally agreed upon terms with the Covenanters in August 1641, but although this might have weakened the position of the English Parliament, the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] broke out in October 1641, largely negating the political advantage he had obtained by relieving himself of the cost of the Scottish invasion.<ref>Ohlmeyer, Jane.
