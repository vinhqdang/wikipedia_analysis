'''William Richard "Bill" Keating''' (born September 6, 1952) is an American politician who has served as a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[Massachusetts]] since 2011. He is a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] representing the state's {{ushr|MA|9|9th district}}, which includes [[Cape Cod]] and the surrounding region. Keating raised his profile advocating for criminal justice issues in the [[Massachusetts General Court|state legislature]] before becoming [[district attorney]] (DA) of [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County]], where he served three terms prior to his election to Congress.

Born and raised in [[Norwood, Massachusetts]], Keating "took a traditional route to politics",<ref name="globe-player" /> attending [[Boston College]] and [[Suffolk University Law School]]. As a resident of [[Sharon, Massachusetts|Sharon]] he was elected to the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] in 1976 and went on to serve in the state [[Massachusetts Senate|Senate]] from 1985 to 1999. He authored numerous bills, signed into law, concerning taxation, drug crime, and sentencing reform. His attempted overthrow of Senate President [[William M. Bulger]] in 1994 was a failure but boosted his local name recognition, which contributed to his success in the 1998 election for DA.

He followed the path of former Norfolk DA [[Bill Delahunt]] to Congress, winning election in 2010 to represent the [[Massachusetts's 10th congressional district|10th district]]. Due to census redistricting which would have placed him in competition against a fellow Representative, in 2012 he chose to run in the "incumbent-free" 9th district, where he was elected to a second term. As of the [[113th United States Congress|113th Congress]] (2013<U+2013>2014), Keating sits on the House [[United States House Committee on Homeland Security|Homeland Security Committee]] and the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Foreign Affairs Committee]]. Much of his work has focused on domestic issues central to his district, such as the fishing industry and nuclear safety.

==Early life, education, and law career==
Keating was born in [[Norwood, Massachusetts]] in 1952 to Anna (n<U+00E9>e Welch) and William B. Keating. Graduating from [[Sharon High School]], Keating enrolled in [[Boston College]] where he received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1974, and his [[Masters of Business Administration]] in 1982. In 1985 Keating earned his [[Juris Doctor]] from [[Suffolk University Law School]] and passed the [[Massachusetts Bar Association|bar exam]]. Keating later became a partner at the law firm of ''Keating & Fishman''.<ref name="GPO bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CDIR-2011-12-01/pdf/CDIR-2011-12-01-MA.pdf|title=GPO Massachusetts' Bio's|accessdate=February 1, 2013|work=[[United States Government Printing Office]]}}</ref><ref name="nda" />

==Massachusetts General Court==
===House of Representatives===
In 1977 Keating was elected to the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] from the 19th [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk]] district, where he served for a year, and was later elected from the 8th Norfolk district, serving from 1979 to 1984.<ref name="GPO bio" /><ref name="7 News">{{cite web|url=http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/politics/massachusetts/12008441656686/u-s-house-district-9-dem-primary-bill-keating/|title=U.S. House District 9 Dem.

McGee]] as Speaker of the House.<ref name="globe-player" /> By the end of his House tenure, Keating became vice chairman of the House Criminal Justice Committee.<ref name="globe-district" />

===Senate===
In 1984, state Sen. [[Joseph F. Timilty (state senator)|Joseph F. Timilty]] resigned his Norfolk and [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk]] seat to pursue a career in private law, and Keating became the only major Democratic contender for the office. In the general election he faced [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Marion Boch, who promoted a plan for dramatic cuts to legislators' pay and hours, invoking the energy of the [[Ronald Reagan]] campaign. Keating focused his campaign on expanding resources for crime prevention and education, tailoring his message to the Boston constituency he would pick up as a senator.<ref name="globe-district">{{cite news |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/663013581.html?FMT=ABS |title=Senate district sees power shift |author=Negri, Gloria |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=August 31, 1984}}</ref> He was successful, winning about 64 percent of the vote, and was sworn in the following January.<ref>{{cite news |title=ELECTION '84 / State races - the tabulations |work=The Boston Globe |date=November 8, 1984}}</ref>

In his first year he was named Senate chairman of the joint Public Safety Committee, where he led the legislative action for a statewide [[seat belt legislation in the United States|seat belt law]] pushed by Governor [[Michael Dukakis]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/662144821.html?FMT=ABS |title=Senate OK's mandatory seat belt law; approval by Dukakis expected soon |author=Blake, Andrew |work=The Boston Globe |date=September 19, 1985}}</ref> He authored a drug sentencing reform package signed into law in 1988, lowering thresholds for possession charges and establishing new minimum sentences, including a one-year minimum sentence for first-time possession of [[cocaine]] or [[phencyclidine|PCP]] "with intent to distribute".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/59645714.html?FMT=ABS |title='Sully, that's the guy who shot me!' |author=Sean Murphy and Diego Ribadeneira |work=The Boston Globe |date=July 15, 1988}}</ref> The latter provision was widely derided by criminal justice authorities as excessively strict and vaguely worded.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/59665116.html?FMT=ABS |title=Strict new drug law a puzzle to authorities |author=Cullen, Kevin |work=The Boston Globe |date=September 10, 1988}}</ref>

Redistricting eventually placed Keating in the Norfolk and [[Bristol County, Massachusetts|Bristol]] seat (1989<U+2013>1994).<ref name="GPO bio" /><ref name="7 News" /> As a vice chairman of the joint Criminal Justice Committee, Keating was a lead author of a 1991 sentencing reform bill, signed into law by Governor [[William Weld]], that made it easier to try juveniles as adults and pass harsher sentences in the case of major crimes, especially murder. "What is occuring is a shift away from the rehabilitative stance to a focus on the seriousness of the crime committed by the juvenile," said Keating.<ref>{{cite news |title=Juvenile-offender bill passes; Bay State lawmakers close out |work=[[Telegram & Gazette]] |location=[[Worcester, Massachusetts]] |date=December 31, 1991 |author=McNiff, Brian S.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=State slams jail door on youth killers Lawmakers pass tough mandatory sentences |work=[[Boston Herald]] |date=December 31, 1991 |author=Connolly, Robert}}</ref> In 1992, as co-chairman of the Taxation Committee, he successfully pushed a proposal to phase out the Massachusetts [[estate tax]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/61791668.html?FMT=ABS |title=Bulger, Locke make a deal to eliminate estate tax |author=Howe, Peter J. |date=June 23, 1992 |work=The Boston Globe}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/61853357.html?FMT=ABS |title=Elimination of estate tax starts |author=Hanafin, Teresa M. |date=September 19, 1992 |work=The Boston Globe}}</ref>

In 1994 Keating led a group of liberals in a failed [[Coup d'<U+00E9>tat|coup]] to remove state Senate President [[William M. Bulger|William Bulger]], a fellow Democrat, from his position. Keating, a staunch liberal relative to the more socially conservative Bulger, sought to reform the Senate rules to greatly reduce the president's power. Bulger, who had held the Senate gavel for 15 years, exerted strict control over the body's operations, but was gradually losing his power base with new crops of Democratic freshmen replacing his longtime allies.<ref name="globe-player">{{cite news |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/61827708.html?FMT=ABS |title=Keating a former team player now challenging the system |author=Lehigh, Scot; Phillips, Frank |date=October 26, 1993}}</ref> Keating's campaign failed, but he said during his 2010 election campaign: "The thought that I took on the most powerful person in Massachusetts, risking my whole career, a member of my own party, is something that is resonating in this campaign, that helps define me as independent."<ref name="Keating Who Runs Gov">{{cite web|title=William Keating (D-Mass.)|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/william-keating-d-mass/gIQA23JXKP_topic.html|publisher=The Washington Post}}</ref>

Further redistricting landed Keating in the Norfolk, Bristol, and [[Plymouth County, Massachusetts|Plymouth]] district from 1995 to 1998.<ref name="GPO bio" /><ref name="7 News" /> Throughout his Senate tenure, Keating served as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Chairman of the Committee on Taxation, and Vice Chairman of the Committee on Criminal Justice; he also served as the Senate Chairman of the Committee on Public Safety and Chairman of the Steering and Policy Committee.<ref name="nda">{{cite web |url=http://www.mass.gov/norfolkda/Bio.html |title=Biography |publisher=Norfolk District Attorney's Office |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vAzOdSfp |archivedate=December 22, 2010}}</ref>

==District attorney==
Speculation emerged in early 1997 that Keating was planning a run for [[district attorney]] (DA) of Norfolk County.<ref>{{cite news |title=State Senate may face a turbulent year; many members eyeing run for higher office |author=Aucoin, Don |work=The Boston Globe |date=February 17, 1997}}</ref> He faced two former Norfolk assistant DAs, John J. Corrigan and William P. O'Donnell, in the Democratic primary. Keating, whose name recognition was boosted by the attempted Bulger coup, presented his work on public safety, criminal justice, and judiciary committees as a strength, while the other candidates pointed to his lack of courtroom experience as a disqualifier. While Keating held a part-time law practice during his legislative career, he lacked exposure to the criminal cases handled by the DA's office.<ref>{{cite news |title=Candidates for Norfolk DA outline their goals |author=Laidler, John |work=The Boston Globe |date=August 30, 1998}}</ref> After winning the Democratic nomination, Keating faced incumbent DA Jeffrey A. Locke in the November 1998 general election. Locke, a Republican, had been appointed to the position by Governor Weld the previous year after the resignation of [[Bill Delahunt]]. With years of experience as a prosecutor, Locke portrayed Keating as a career politician and echoed his primary opponents' criticism of his experience. Keating highlighted a range of endorsements from police organizations, and from Delahunt, as evidence of his criminal justice qualifications. Aided by a Democratic-leaning electorate, Keating won the election with around 55 percent of the vote.<ref>{{cite news |title=Keating unseats Locke; Coakley takes Middlesex |author=Laidler, John |work=The Boston Globe |date=November 4, 1998}}</ref>

Upon taking office in January 1999, he immediately replaced two top officials, and one-third of the remaining staff were replaced or left voluntarily. Press reports criticized the move as overly political and aggressive, particularly as it affected ongoing trials.<ref name="globe-yr1" /><ref>{{cite news |title=Impact of politics is felt in slay case; fired prosecutor opts out of retrial |author=Ellen O'Brien and John Ellement |work=The Boston Globe |date=January 6, 1999}}</ref> In his first year he founded the Norfolk Anti-Crime Council, a 35-member forum for judicial officers, police, and other local parties to discuss and co-ordinate anti-crime strategies. He established a pilot program for a [[drug court]] under Quincy District Court, which would provide an alternative sentencing pathway for nonviolent drug offenders, in an effort to reduce court backlogs and lower recidivism rates. He also expanded his office's juvenile crime unit.<ref name="globe-yr1">{{cite news |title=Keating on accomplishments, goals after year as Norfolk DA |author=Laidler, John |work=The Boston Globe |date=February 20, 2000}}</ref> In late 2000 he laid the groundwork for the Norfolk Country Children's Advocacy Center, based on similar programs in [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex]] and [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk]] counties,<ref>{{cite news |title=3d child advocacy center is in the works |author=Laidler, John |work=The Boston Globe |date=January 28, 2001}}</ref> and it was fully established the following year.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hospital site may be home to child center; DA seeking to relocate advocacy unit |author=Laidler, John |work=The Boston Globe |date=November 2, 2003}}</ref> Keating's office also began an anti-bullying program in spring 2001.<ref>{{cite news |title=Schools try to keep bullying in check; study backs prevention programs |author=Redd, C.

In advance of the 2002 elections, he was seen as a likely contender to succeed deceased Rep. [[Joe Moakley]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], but he opted to run for a second term as DA instead,<ref>{{cite news |title=Keating denies interest in Congress |author=Laidler, John |work=The Boston Globe |date=April 29, 2001}}</ref> and was unopposed for re-election.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/massachusettsele2002mass#page/415/mode/2up |title=Massachusetts Election Statistics |page=415 |publisher=Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth |year=2002}}</ref> He won a third term, still unopposed, in 2006.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://archive.org/stream/massachusettsele2006mass#page/401/mode/2up |title=Massachusetts Election Statistics |page=401 |publisher=Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth |year=2006}}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
With incumbent Bill Delahunt choosing to retire, Keating declared his candidacy in the [[United States House of Representatives elections in Massachusetts, 2010#District 10|2010 congressional election]]. On September 14, he won the Democratic primary against state senator [[Robert O'Leary]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bostonherald.com/news/politics/view.bg?articleid=1239004|title=DA William Keating won't run for reelection|work=Boston Herald|date=March 11, 2010 |author=Johnson, O'Ryan}}</ref> Keating faced Republican state Representative [[Jeff Perry (politician)|Jeff Perry]] in the general election. In the wake of the [[Tea Party movement]] and the election of Republican U.S. Senator [[Scott Brown]], the campaign was unusually close for a modern Massachusetts race, which would normally skew heavily Democratic. The Keating campaign largely focused on a 1991 incident during Perry's tenure as a police sergeant, in which a teenage girl had been illegally strip-searched by another officer while Perry was on the scene. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ran a widely aired advertisement highlighting the incident and challenging Perry's character.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/democrats-defend-mass-seat-once-deemed-safe/ |title=Democrats Defend Mass. Seat Once Deemed Safe |work=The Caucus ([[The New York Times]]) |date=October 7, 2010 |author=Lorber, Janie}}</ref> With 47 percent of the vote, Keating defeated Perry (42 percent) and two independents, in the November 2 election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2010/results/massachusetts |title=Massachusetts <U+2013> Election Results 2010 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

With the state poised to lose a congressional seat after the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], lawmakers released a redistricting plan in November 2011 that placed Keating into the same congressional district as [[Stephen Lynch (politician)|Stephen Lynch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.malegislature.gov/District/ProposedDistrictMaps|title=MAlegislature.gov new District Maps|publisher=Massachusetts State Legislature|date=2011-11-07}}</ref> Under the plan, the cities of Quincy and other upper South Shore towns were placed into Lynch's district, potentially forcing a primary between the two lawmakers. Instead of campaigning against his fellow Congressman in the 2012 election, Keating chose to move to his summer home in [[Cape Cod]], to run in an "incumbent-free" district. Keating defeated Bristol County District Attorney Samuel Sutter in the September 6 Democratic primary, and in November 2012 he defeated Republican Christopher Sheldon to win a second term in the U.S. House.

===Tenure===
[[Image:William R Keating.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Keating giving a speech in October 2010]]
Keating is considered a [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] by national standards. In 2012, the ''[[National Journal]]'' ranked Keating as "the 84th most liberal member of the House", but second only to Stephen Lynch as the most [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] of the Massachusetts House delegation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/blogs/hotlineoncall/2013/02/senate-candidate-lynch-rated-most-conservative-rep-in-mass-21 |title=Senate Candidate Lynch Rated Most Conservative Rep. in Mass. |work=[[National Journal]] |date=February 21, 2013}}</ref>

====Economic issues and budget====
Issues specific to his Cape Cod<U+2013>based district, such as maritime policy, have been a major target of Keating's work. In June 2012, he organized the Federal Fishing Advisory Board, a body to research and address [[fisheries management]] concerns between lawmakers and industry stakeholders.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gloucestertimes.com/fishing/x651523756/Lawmaker-forms-new-fishery-research-panel |title=Lawmakers forms new fishery research panel |date=June 20, 2012 |work=Gloucester Times |author=Gaines, Richard}}</ref> In 2012 he and his Massachusetts peers successfully pushed the [[United States Department of Commerce|Commerce Department]] to issue a federal disaster declaration for fisheries in the northeastern U.S., which would open up the opportunity for financial aid.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/14/us/commerce-dept-declares-northeast-fishery-a-disaster.html |title=U.S. Declares a Disaster for Fishery in Northeast |author=Bidgood, Jess; Johnson, Kirk |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 13, 2012}}</ref> In the wake of [[Hurricane Sandy]], he proposed to redirect $111 million of relief funding to fisheries throughout the country, although the proposal was not adopted by the House Rules Committee.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/2866130101.html?FMT=ABS |title=Bid to link fishermen's aid to storm bill fails |author=Uberti, David |date=January 16, 2013 |work=The Boston Globe}}</ref>

When the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] considered a 20-year contract extension for the [[Pilgrim Nuclear Generating Station]] in the Cape Cod town of [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]] in mid-2012, Keating repeatedly took to the press. He at first declined to take a position on the plant's re-authorization, stating, "I wouldn't be the right person to ask and that's why we have regulatory authorities and people with expertise to deal with that."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.patriotledger.com/topstories/x770708980/Congressman-William-Keating-wants-the-Pilgrim-nuclear-plant-review-to-play-out |title=Rep.

Along with U.S. Senator [[John Kerry]], Keating helped to finalize the cleanup and sale of portions of a defunct naval air base in [[South Weymouth, Massachusetts|South Weymouth]] to private developers. The deal, reached in November 2011, was a linchpin for the SouthField development project.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/2510955841.html?FMT=ABS |title=Deal reached on air base land |author=Ross, Casey |date=November 15, 2011 |work=The Boston Globe}}</ref>

Keating has stressed his opposition to [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] reductions such as raising the retirement age or privatizing the program,<ref name="Keating 2010 position">{{cite news|title=10th Congressional District - Bill Keating, D-Quincy|url=http://www.barnstablepatriot.com/home2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=22183|date=9 September 2010}}</ref><ref name="votesmart.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/candidate/political-courage-test/4743/bill-keating/|title=Issue Positions (Political Courage Test) Representative William "Bill" R.
