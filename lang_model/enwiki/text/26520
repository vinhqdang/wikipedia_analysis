===Command and Conquer series===
[[Image:Cctd.gif|right|thumb|200px|''Command & Conquer'', a career turning point]]
In 1994, Frank Klepacki met with Westwood Studios developers to discuss the soundtrack of the company's next project<U+2014>''Command & Conquer''. To define the game's style, Klepacki listened to a number of bands.<ref name="behindcc" /> He combined various elements of this music and added his own touch to create a unique sound. With the company's recent shift to 22 [[Hertz|kHz]] audio, Klepacki composed with an ASR-10 sampler, a [[Roland]] S760 sampler, a Roland JD 990 synth module, and an [[electric guitar]].<ref name="behindcc" /> The first few songs he composed for ''Command & Conquer'' contained voice samples<U+2014>including the notable pieces ''Act on Instinct'' and ''No Mercy''. The samples were later found to interfere with the game's spoken audio, and the voices were removed. Complete versions of the songs later appeared on the game's commercial soundtrack.<ref name="behindcc" /> Klepacki next composed instrumental pieces, drawing influences from  [[orchestra|orchestral]], [[house music|house]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and [[hip hop music]]. For the [[Credit (creative arts)|credits]], Klepacki wrote ''Airstrike'', featuring a hook later used in ''[[Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun]]'' for the [[Global Defense Initiative]]. Conversely, the [[Brotherhood of Nod]] ending used the song ''Destructible Times'' written by Klepacki's local band, [[I AM]]. Developers requested the song because it "reflected the war aspect and bad-ass vibe of [Nod's] side."<ref name="behindcc" /> The ''C&C'' expansion pack ''Covert Operations'' featured new [[ambient music|ambient]] pieces.<ref name="behindcc" /> Though the soundtrack was not released through retail, Westwood sold it by special order through its website and in game catalogues.<ref name="westwoodcatalogue">{{Cite book | year=2000 | author=Westwood Studios | title=The Westwood Studios Catalog | publisher=Westwood Studios | language=English}}</ref>

[[Image:Klepackicameo.png|left|thumb|320px|Frank Klepacki and [[Joseph D. Kucan]] in a ''[[Command & Conquer: Red Alert|Red Alert]]'' cut scene]]
While working on ''Covert Operations'', Frank Klepacki composed ''Hell March''. Upon listening, director [[Brett Sperry]] insisted this song be used as the signature theme of ''Command & Conquer: Red Alert.''<ref name="behindcc" /> Originally intended for use with the Brotherhood of Nod, it features militaristic samples<U+2014>including marching, industrial sounds, and a commander shouting "we want war, wake up!"<ref name="behindra">{{cite web | title=COMMENTARY: Behind the Red Alert Soundtrack | author=Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com frankklepacki.com] | accessdate=27 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Klepacki initially scored ''Red Alert'' with sci-fi camp in mind, but early songs were shelved. He switched gears to write gritty pieces, prompting the ''Red Alert'' team to expand upon the style of ''Command & Conquer''.<Ref name="behindra" /> In preparing to compose, Klepacki acquired new sample libraries for unique and strange sounds. Particular creative moods would result in a few songs at a time.<ref name="behindra" /> He first wrote heavy songs like ''Workmen'' and ''Crush'', then composed neutral, synthesizer-laden music, such as ''Vector'' and ''Roll Out''. Klepacki scored ''Fogger'' and ''Mud'', one of his personal favorites, before finishing with ''Militant Force'' and ''Radio 2''. He took breaks from working to make cameo appearances as a soldier killed by [[Joseph D. Kucan]] and an Allied commander in the [[cut scene]]s of ''Red Alert''. He previously appeared as a [[Brotherhood of Nod|Nod]] soldier and the voice of the commando in ''Command & Conquer'' and would voice bit parts in future Westwood games.<ref name="actingcameos">{{cite web | title=COMMENTARY: Frank's acting cameos | author=Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com frankklepacki.com] | accessdate=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

After completing ''Red Alert'', he took a short break to review his work. He concluded that some songs could be enhanced, but ''Red Alert'' had already gone [[Development stage#Gold.2Fgeneral availability release|gold]], precluding new versions.<ref name="behindra" /> These remixes later appeared on the unsuccessful ''Command & Conquer: Sole Survivor''. ''Red Alert''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s soundtrack was voted best video game soundtrack of 1996 by [[PC Gamer]] and Gameslice magazines, defeating [[Trent Reznor]]'s score for ''[[Quake]]''.<ref name="behindra" /><ref name="music4gamesinterview" /> Reviewers called it "fun to listen to" and "second to none."<ref name="gamespotredalert">{{cite web | author=Vince Broady | date=1996-11-26 | title=Review of Red Alert | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/commandconquerredalert/review.html | work=[http://www.gamespot.com/ Gamespot] | accessdate=23 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="darkzeroredalert">{{cite web | date=2002-12-29 | title=Review of Red Alert | url=http://darkzero.co.uk/index2.php?articleid=12 | work=[http://wwww.darkzero.co.uk DarkZero] | accessdate=23 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref> As of 2005, ''Red Alert'' has sold 35 million game units, bringing Klepacki his widest audience.<ref name="guinness">{{Cite book | year=2005 | editor=Claire Folkard | title=The Guinness Book of World Records | publisher=Bantam Books | language=English | id=0553588109 }}</ref> He wrote additional music for the game's [[expansion pack]]s, ''Counterstrike'' and ''Aftermath''.

In 1997, Frank Klepacki scored a ''[[Blade Runner]]'' adaptation and in 1998 composed for ''[[Dune 2000]]''. He attempted to update the music from ''[[Dune II]]'' into "this non-blip stuff."<ref name="avaultinterview" /> ''Dune 2000'' was panned by critics, though Klepacki's score was praised for adhering to the traditional ''Dune'' style.<ref name="gamespotdune2000">{{cite web | author=Ron Dulin | date=1997-12-03 | title=Review of Dune 2000 | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/adventure/bladerunner/review.html | work=[http://www.gamespot.com/ Gamespot] | accessdate=23 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref> He composed for ''[[Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun]]'' with [[Jarrid Mendelson]]<U+2014>with whom he would later collaborate on ''[[Emperor: Battle for Dune]]''.<Ref name="videogamesheet" /> ''Tiberian Sun'' featured dark, ambient [[techno music]] suited to the game's post-apocalyptic setting.<ref name="tsreview">{{cite web | title=Review of Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun | author=The Logbook staff | url=http://www.thelogbook.com/disc/q3-02/t.htm | work=[http://www.thelogbook.com The Logbook] | accessdate=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Klepacki cited the piece "Mad Rap" as his favorite. An avid ''[[Star Wars]]'' fan, he enjoyed scoring [[cut scenes]] featuring [[James Earl Jones]], the voice of [[Darth Vader]].<ref name="petroglyphpodcast" /> He next scored ''[[Lands of Lore]] III'' and ''[[Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2]]''. Klepacki defined ''Red Alert 2''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s style with heavy metal guitar and fast-paced beats.<ref name="ra2review">{{cite web | title=Review of Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 | author=The Logbook staff | url=http://www.thelogbook.com/disc/q3-02/r.htm | work=[http://www.thelogbook.com The Logbook] | accessdate=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Klepacki scored the game with a [[Korg]] Tr-rack, [[Novation]], and [[Roland]] 5080.<ref name="westwoodnetinterview">{{cite web | year=2001 | title=Frank Klepacki Interview (Yuri's Revenge) | url=http://www.westwoodi.net/read.php?Articles/Frank_Klepacki_Interview | work=[http://www.westwoodi.net Westwood Infiltration] | accessdate=28 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref> ''Red Alert 2''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s included a remix of "Hell March".

Though Frank Klepacki offered to score ''[[Command & Conquer: Generals]]'' and submitted a demo to EA, he was not contacted to compose.<ref name="interviewfaq" /> Klepacki took a brief hiatus to work on solo albums, then joined [[Petroglyph (game studio)|Petroglyph]] games as full-time audio director in 2004.<ref name="petroglyphpodcast" /> He prepared by becoming versed in the job's requirements and demands.<ref name="petroglyphpodcast" /> His first task was scoring ''[[Star Wars: Empire at War]]'', Petroglyph's launch title. A die-hard fan of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise, Klepacki enjoyed complementing [[John Williams]]'s style as he worked with sound effects used in the feature films.<ref name="music4gamesinterview" /> He worked closely with programmers to ensure perfect aural functionality. Though most the game's score is John Williams's work, Klepacki estimates that he contributed 20% original material. Apart from the main theme, he aimed to minimize his editing in order to retain the classic ''Star Wars'' sound.<ref name="music4gamesinterview" /> He chiefly composed for new areas of the ''Star Wars'' universe only found in ''Empire at War''. He calls his work on the game "the peak of my career,"<ref name="petroglyphpodcast" /> and felt he had spent his entire life grooming his abilities for that soundtrack.<ref name="gwjinterview" /> He has noted that he can take greater freedoms with the expansion pack by giving the new criminal faction a theme.<ref name="petroglyphpodcast" />

Frank Klepacki has not been contacted to score ''[[Command & Conquer 3]]''.

He sometimes must compose songs based off vague descriptions.<ref name="westwoodnetinterview" /> Composing for cut scenes is easier by comparison.<ref name="westwoodnetinterview" /> He has said that the most rewarding part of composing video game music is working with a team<U+2014>which he compares to chemistry between band members<U+2014>and knowing he is part of a greater cause.<ref name="petroglyphpodcast" /> He believes that game music could improve if artists focused on quality and derived inspiration from playing games.<ref name="music4gamesinterview" /> He has expressed interest in having Electronic Arts sell his soundtracks in retail stores, preferably next to video games in electronic departments.<ref name="music4gamesinterview4">{{cite web | title=Video Game Soundtrack Report 1.0 | url=http://www.music4games.net/f_soundtracks_report_1.html | work=[http://www.music4games.net/ Music4Games] | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021107110623/http://www.music4games.net/f_soundtracks_report_1.html | archivedate=2002-11-07 | accessdate=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> He advises those wishing to get in the video game business to attend conventions and investigate developer companies.<ref name="petroglyphpodcast" />

Klepacki runs a personal [http://www.frankklepacki.com website] featuring a biography, archived interviews, and a playlist of songs [[streaming media|streamed]] in 128 [[Kilobit per second|kbit/s]] [[mp3]]. His music is also available from [[iTunes]]. As a ''Star Wars'' fan, he has extensively written about the film premieres of the last two prequels on his website.<ref name="klepackistarwars">{{cite web | title=COMMENTARY: Frank at ''Star Wars'' Celebration 2 | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/ | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com frankklepacki] | accessdate=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> He maintains an account at [[Youtube]] and has posted three videos of his work with other bands.<Ref name="video">{{cite web | year=2006 | title=Youtube: Flyrecords1 | url=http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=flyrecords1 | work=[http://www.youtube.com/ YouTube |accessdate=25 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref> He is an ardent supporter of [[digital cinema]], believing the medium to be the pinnacle of quality.<ref name="digitalcinema">{{cite web | title=COMMENTARY: Digital Cinema | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com frankklepacki.com] | accessdate=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> He has scored two short films, and won a [[Cinevegas]] award for his work with ''Unreel Invasion''.<Ref name="aboutme">{{cite web | title=Frank Klepacki: About Me | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com frankklepacki.com] | accessdate=27 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Klepacki believes that the genre of video game music is more respected than it has ever been. He notes that complex and quality music comes at a higher cost, prompting certain producers to simply "get somebody who could cop the Hollywood sound" instead of nurturing original style.<ref name="gwjinterview" /> When asked about his career low-point, he named ''[[Order of the Griffon]]'' for the [[TurboGrafx-16]], citing difficulties with the system's limited musical capabilities.<ref name="gwjinterview" />

Klepacki is not seeking a record deal, citing a "horrible chain of steps to getting famous." Scathingly critical of the [[recording industry]], he blames [[MTV]] for putting a pretty face on music and destroying the independent valuation of actual sound.<ref name="klepackirecorddeal">{{cite web | title=COMMENTARY: Record Deals | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/ | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com frankklepacki] | accessdate=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> He has also criticized [[lip-synching]] and the repackaging of music genre through different labels<U+2014>such as [[Nu metal]] for [[rock music]] and [[Neo soul]] for [[soul music]].<ref name="klepackirecorddeal" /> He believes that signing a deal does not guarantee profits, and would rather keep his [[day job]] as audio director. These sentiments were echoed in a special feature on the band [[Home Cookin']] in 2000<U+2014>Klepacki said the group wanted to "work with a label, not for them."<ref name="homecookin0">{{cite web | title=Sonic Garden: Home Cookin' | url=http://www.sonicgarden.com/sonic-web/artist.cfm?artistid=4960 | work=[http://www.sonicgarden.com/ Sonic Garden] | accessdate=25 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref> He champions the internet as a medium through which creative and original artists can be found. Klepacki believes it is the preferred avenue for music when compared to radio [[airplay]]<U+2014>where one hears "the exact same songs 3 months at a time."<ref name="klepackirecorddeal" /> When interviewed about file-sharing, he expressed mixed emotions.<ref name="westwoodnetinterview" /> He believes that the high price of [[compact disc]]s could prompt one to download music. Conversely, he notes that artists<U+2014>who "don't get as much money as you think"<U+2014>need to be compensated for their work.<ref name="westwoodnetinterview" />
