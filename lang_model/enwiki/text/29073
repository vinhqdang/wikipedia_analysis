'''Tourette syndrome''' (also called '''Tourette's syndrome''', '''Tourette's disorder''', '''Gilles de la Tourette syndrome''', '''GTS''' or, more commonly, simply '''Tourette's''' or '''TS''') is an [[heredity|inherited]] [[Neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatric]] disorder with onset in childhood, characterized by the presence of multiple physical (motor) [[tic]]s and at least one vocal (phonic) tic; these tics characteristically wax and wane. Tourette's is defined as part of a [[spectrum disorder|spectrum]] of [[tic disorder]]s, which includes transient and chronic tics. 

Tourette's was once considered a rare and bizarre [[syndrome]], most often associated with the exclamation of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks ([[coprolalia]]).  However, this symptom is present in only a small minority of people with Tourette's.<ref name=dude>Schapiro NA. "Dude, you don't have Tourette's:" Tourette's syndrome, beyond the tics.

The severity of the tics decreases for most children as they pass through [[adolescence]], and extreme Tourette's in adulthood is a rarity.

[[Genetics|Genetic]] and environmental factors each play a role in the [[etiology]] of Tourette's, but the exact causes are unknown. In most cases, medication is unnecessary.  There is no effective medication for every case of tics, but there are medications and therapies that can help when their use is warranted.  Explanation and  reassurance alone are often sufficient treatment;<ref name=Zinner>Zinner (2000).</ref> education is an important part of any treatment plan.<ref>Peterson BS, Cohen DJ.

The [[eponym]] was bestowed by [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] (1825<U+2013>93) on behalf of his resident, [[Georges Gilles de la Tourette|Georges Albert <U+00C9>douard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette]] (1859<U+2013>1904), a French physician and [[neurology|neurologist]], who published an account of nine patients with Tourette's in 1885.

==Classification==
[[Tic]]s are sudden, repetitive, stereotyped, nonrhythmic movements (motor tics) and utterances (phonic tics) that involve discrete muscle groups.<ref name=phenomenology>Leckman JF, Bloch MH, King RA, Scahill L. "Phenomenology of tics and natural history of tic disorders". ''Adv Neurol.'' 2006;99:1<U+2013>16. PMID 16536348</ref>  Motor tics are movement-based tics, while phonic tics are involuntary sounds produced by moving air through the nose, mouth, or throat.

Tourette's is one of several [[tic disorder]]s, which are classified by the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) according to type (motor or phonic tics) and duration (transient or chronic). Transient tic disorder consists of multiple motor tics, phonic tics or both, with a duration between four weeks and twelve months.  Chronic tic disorder is either single or multiple, motor or phonic tics (but not both), which are present for more than a year.<ref name=phenomenology/>   Tourette's is diagnosed when multiple motor tics, and at least one phonic tic, are present for more than a year.<ref name=BehaveNet> [[American Psychiatric Association]] (2000).

Tics also occur in "bouts of bouts", which vary for each person.<ref name=phenomenology/>

[[Coprolalia]] (the spontaneous utterance of socially objectionable or taboo words or phrases) is the most publicized symptom of Tourette's, but it is not required for a diagnosis of Tourette's and only about 10% of Tourette's patients exhibit coprolalia.<ref name=SingerBehavior>Singer HS.

In contrast to the abnormal movements of other [[movement disorder]]s (for example, [[chorea (disease)|chorea]]s, [[dystonia]]s, [[myoclonus]], and [[dyskinesia]]s), the tics of Tourette's are stereotypic, temporarily suppressible, nonrhythmic, and often preceded by an unwanted premonitory urge.<ref>Jankovic J.

The actual tic may be felt as relieving this tension or sensation, similar to scratching an itch.  Another example is blinking to relieve an uncomfortable sensation in the eye.  These urges and sensations, preceding the expression of the movement or vocalization as a tic, are referred to as "premonitory [[sensory phenomena]]" or premonitory urges.  Because of the urges that precede them, tics are described as semi-voluntary or ''"unvoluntary",''<!-- Please do NOT CHANGE "UNVOLUNTARY" to "INVOLUNTARY"; it is not a typo, it is the correct term, please read the text and the references. --><ref name=TSADef/> rather than specifically ''involuntary''; they may be experienced as a ''voluntary'', suppressible response to the unwanted premonitory urge.<ref name=SingerBehavior/>  Published descriptions of the tics of Tourette's identify sensory phenomena as the core [[symptom]] of the syndrome, even though they are not included in the diagnostic criteria.<ref name="Bliss"/><ref>Scahill LD, Leckman JF, Marek KL.

While individuals with tics are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods of time, doing so often results in an explosion of tics afterward.<ref name=Zinner/>  People with Tourette's may seek a secluded spot to release their symptoms, or there may be a marked increase in tics after a period of suppression at school or at work.<ref name=Dure/>  Some people with Tourette's may not be aware of the premonitory urge. Children may be less aware of the premonitory urge associated with tics than are adults, but their awareness tends to increase with maturity.<ref name=TSADef/>  They may have tics for several years before becoming aware of premonitory urges.  Children may suppress tics while in the doctor's office, so they may need to be observed while they are not aware they are being watched.<ref name=emed>Black, KJ.

Although there is no such thing as a "typical" case of Tourette syndrome,<ref name=Zinner/> the condition follows a fairly reliable course in terms of the age of onset and the history of the severity of symptoms. Tics may appear up to the age of eighteen, but the most typical age of onset is from five to seven.<ref name=phenomenology/>  A 1998 study published by Leckman ''et al.'' of the [[Yale Child Study Center]]<ref name=YaleTicSeverity>Leckman JF, Zhang H, Vitale A, ''et al.''

Initial tics present most frequently in midline body regions where there are many muscles, usually the head, neck and facial region.<ref name=Zinner/> This can be contrasted with the stereotyped movements of other disorders (such as [[stimming|stim]]s and [[stereotypy (psychiatry)|stereotypies]] of the [[autism spectrum disorder]]s), which typically have an earlier age of onset, are more symmetrical, rhythmical and bilateral, and involve the extremities (e.g., flapping the hands).<ref name=Rapin>Rapin I.

==Causes==
{{main|Causes and origins of Tourette syndrome}}
The exact cause of Tourette's is unknown, but it is well established that both genetic and environmental factors are involved.<ref name=AN2intro>Walkup JT, Mink JW, Hollenback PJ, (eds).  ''Advances in Neurology, Vol. 99, Tourette Syndrome.''  Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA, 2006, p. xv. ISBN 0-7817-9970-8</ref>  Genetic studies have shown that the overwhelming majority of cases of Tourette's are inherited, although the exact mode of inheritance is not yet known,<ref>Robertson MM (2000), p. 425.</ref> and no gene has been identified.<ref name=Zinner/> In some cases, Tourette's is ''sporadic'', that is, it is not inherited from parents.<ref name=Asmus>Asmus F, Schoenian S, Lichtner P ''et al.'' "Epsilon-sarcoglycan is not involved in sporadic Gilles de la Tourette syndrome". ''Neurogenetics'' 2005;6(1):55<U+2013>6. PMID 15627203</ref> In other cases, tics are associated with disorders other than Tourette's, a phenomenon known as ''[[tourettism]]''.<ref name=Mejia>Mejia NI, Jankovic J.

[[Image:Basal Ganglia and Related Structures.svg<U+200E>|thumb|300px|Brain structures implicated in Tourette's syndrome]]

A person with Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) to one of his or her children, but Tourette's is a condition of [[Expressivity|variable expression]] and [[penetrance|incomplete penetrance]].<ref>van de Wetering BJ, Heutink P. "The genetics of the Gilles de la Tourette syndrome: a review".  ''J Lab Clin Med.'' 1993 May;121(5):638<U+2013>45. PMID 8478592</ref> Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (transient or chronic tics), or as obsessive<U+2013>compulsive symptoms without tics.  Only a minority of the children who inherit the gene(s) have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention.<ref name=TSAFAQ>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060106020124/http://www.tsa-usa.org/what_is/Faqs.html Tourette Syndrome: Frequently Asked Questions.] [[Tourette Syndrome Association]].

Non-genetic, environmental, infectious, or [[psychosocial]] factors<U+2014>while not causing Tourette's<U+2014>can influence its severity.<ref name=Zinner/> [[Autoimmune]] processes may affect tic onset and exacerbation in some cases. In 1998, a team at the US [[National Institute of Mental Health]] proposed a hypothesis that both obsessive<U+2013>compulsive disorder (OCD) and tic disorders may arise in a subset of children as a result of a post[[streptococcus|streptococcal]] autoimmune process.<ref>Swedo SE, Leonard HL, Garvey M, ''et al.''.

The exact mechanism affecting the inherited vulnerability to Tourette's has not been established, and the precise etiology is unknown. Tics are believed to result from dysfunction in cortical and subcortical regions, the [[Human thalamus|thalamus]], [[basal ganglia]] and [[frontal lobe|frontal cortex]].<ref name=AN2intro/>  [[Neuroanatomy|Neuroanatomic]] models implicate failures in circuits connecting the brain's cortex and subcortex,<ref name=Zinner/>  and [[Neuroimaging|imaging techniques]] implicate the basal ganglia and frontal cortex.<ref>Haber SN, Wolfer D.

==Diagnosis==
According to the revised fourth edition of the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' ([[DSM-IV-TR]]), Tourette<U+2019>s Disorder may be diagnosed when a person exhibits both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics (although these do not need to be concurrent) over the period of a year, with no more than three consecutive tic-free months.  The previous DSM-IV included a requirement for "marked distress or significant impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning", but this requirement was removed in the most recent update of the manual, in recognition that clinicians see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.<ref> [http://dsmivtr.org/2-3changes.cfm Summary of Practice:  Relevant changes to DSM-IV-TR.]  ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.'' Retrieved on January 25, 2007.</ref>  The onset must have occurred before the age of 18, and cannot be attributed to the "direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition".<ref name=BehaveNet/>  Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements<U+2014>such as [[autism]] or other causes of [[tourettism]]<U+2014>must be ruled out before conferring a Tourette's diagnosis. 

There are no specific medical or screening tests that can be used in diagnosing Tourette's;<ref name=Swain>Swain JE, Scahill L, Lombroso PJ, King RA, Leckman JF. "Tourette syndrome and tic disorders: a decade of progress".  ''J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry''. 2007 Aug;46(8):947<U+2013>68 PMID 17667475 </ref> it is frequently misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed, partly because of the wide expression of severity, ranging from mild (the majority of cases) or moderate, to severe (the rare, but more widely-recognized and publicized cases).<ref name=YaleTicSeverity/>  Coughing, eye blinking and tics that mimic asthma are commonly misdiagnosed.<ref name=SingerBehavior/>

The diagnosis is made based on observation of the individual's symptoms and family history,<ref name=SingerBehavior/> and after ruling out [[tourettism|secondary causes of tic disorders.]]<ref name=TSAFAQ/>  In patients with a typical onset and a family history of tics or obsessive<U+2013>compulsive disorder, a basic physical and neurological examination may be sufficient.<ref name=Bagheri/>  

There is no requirement that other [[comorbid]] conditions (such as ADHD or OCD) be present,<ref name=SingerBehavior/> but if a physician believes that there may be another condition present that could explain tics, tests may be ordered as necessary to rule out that condition.  An example of this is when diagnostic confusion between tics and [[seizure]] activity exists, which would call for an [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], or if there are symptoms that indicate an [[MRI]] to rule out brain abnormalities.<ref name=Assessment>Scahill L, Erenberg G, Berlin CM Jr, Budman C, Coffey BJ, Jankovic J, Kiessling L, King RA, Kurlan R, Lang A, Mink J, Murphy T, Zinner S, Walkup J; Tourette Syndrome Association Medical Advisory Board: Practice Committee.

PMID 16554257</ref>  [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] levels can be measured to rule out [[hypothyroidism]], which can be a cause of tics.

==Screening==
Although not all people with Tourette's have comorbid conditions, most Tourette's patients presenting for clinical care at specialty referral centers may exhibit symptoms of other conditions along with their motor and phonic tics.<ref name=Denckla/>  Associated conditions include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD or ADHD), obsessive<U+2013>compulsive disorder (OCD), [[learning disabilities]] and [[sleep disorder]]s.<ref name=NIH> [http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/tourette/detail_tourette.htm Tourette Syndrome Fact Sheet].

Because comorbid conditions such as OCD and ADHD can be more impairing than tics, these conditions are included in an evaluation of patients presenting with tics.  "It is critical to note that the comorbid conditions may determine functional status more strongly than the tic disorder," according to Samuel Zinner, MD.<ref name=Zinner/>  The initial assessment of a patient referred for a tic disorder should include a thorough evaluation, including a family history of tics, ADHD, obsessive<U+2013>compulsive symptoms, and other chronic medical, psychiatric and neurological conditions.

==Management==
{{main|Treatment of Tourette syndrome}}
[[Image:Clonidine pills and patch.jpg|thumb|[[Clonidine]] (or the clonidine patch) is one of the medications typically tried first when medication is needed for Tourette's.]]
The treatment of Tourette's focuses on identifying and helping the individual manage the most troubling or impairing symptoms.<ref name=Zinner/>  Most cases of Tourette's are mild, and do not require [[Pharmacology|pharmacological]] treatment;<ref name=TSAWhat/> instead, psychobehavioral therapy, education, and reassurance may be sufficient.<ref>Robertson MM, (2000), p. 435.</ref> Treatments, where warranted, can be divided into those that target tics and comorbid conditions, which, when present, are often a larger source of impairment than the tics themselves.<ref name=Assessment/>  Not all people with tics have comorbid conditions,<ref name=Denckla/> but when those conditions are present, they often take treatment priority.  

There is no cure for Tourette's and no medication that works universally for all individuals without significant adverse effects. Knowledge, education and understanding are uppermost in management plans for tic disorders.<ref name=Zinner/>  The management of the symptoms of Tourette's may include pharmacological, [[behavior]]al and [[psychology|psychological]] therapies. While pharmacological intervention is reserved for more severe symptoms, other treatments (such as supportive psychotherapy or [[cognitive behavioral therapy]]) may help to avoid or ameliorate [[depression (mood)|depression]] and social isolation, and to improve family support. Educating a patient, family, and surrounding community (such as friends, school, and church) is a key treatment strategy, and may be all that is required in mild cases.<ref name=Zinner/><ref name="Robertson2005PMJ">Stern JS, Burza S, Robertson MM. "Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome and its impact in the UK". ''Postgraduate Medicine Journal.'' 2005 Jan;81(951):12<U+2013>9. PMID 15640424 </ref>

[[Image:Haloperidol-3D-vdW.png|thumb|left|Model of a [[haloperidol]] molecule. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic medication sometimes used to treat severe cases of Tourette's.]]

Medication is available to help when symptoms interfere with functioning.<ref name=TSAFAQ/> The classes of medication with the most proven efficacy in treating tics<U+2014>[[Typical antipsychotics|typical]] and [[Atypical antipsychotic|atypical]] [[Antipsychotic|neuroleptics]] including [[risperidone]] (trade name<ref>Medication trade names may differ between countries. In general, this article uses North American trade names.</ref> Risperdal), [[ziprasidone]] (Geodon), [[haloperidol]] (Haldol), [[pimozide]] (Orap) and [[fluphenazine]] (Prolixin)<U+2014>can have long-term and short-term [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]].<ref name=Assessment/>  The [[antihypertensive]] agents [[clonidine]] (trade name Catapres) and [[guanfacine]] (Tenex) are also used to treat tics; studies show variable efficacy, but a lower side effect profile than the neuroleptics.<ref name=dude/> [[Stimulants]] and other medications may be useful in [[Treatment of Tourette syndrome#Treatment of ADHD in the presence of tic disorders|treating ADHD when it co-occurs with tic disorders.]] Drugs from several other classes of medications can be used when stimulant trials fail, including [[guanfacine]] (trade name Tenex), [[atomoxetine]] (Strattera) and [[tricyclic antidepressant|tricyclics]].  [[Clomipramine]] (Anafranil), a [[tricyclic antidepressant]], and [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRIs]]<U+2014>a class of [[antidepressant]]s including [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac), [[sertraline]] (Zoloft), and [[fluvoxamine]] (Luvox)<U+2014>may be prescribed when a Tourette's patient also has symptoms of obsessive<U+2013>compulsive disorder. Several other medications have been tried, including [[nicotine patch]]es, but evidence to support their use is unconvincing.<ref name=Assessment/>  

Because children with tics often present to physicians when their tics are most severe, and because of the waxing and waning nature of tics, it is recommended that medication not be started immediately or changed often.<ref name=Zinner/>  Frequently, the tics subside with explanation, reassurance, understanding of the condition and a supportive environment.<ref name=Zinner/>  When medication is used, the goal is not to eliminate symptoms:  it should be used at the lowest possible dose that manages symptoms without adverse effects, given that these may be more disturbing than the symptoms for which they were prescribed.<ref name=Zinner/>

[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) is a useful treatment when OCD is present,<ref>Coffey BJ, Shechter RL. "Treatment of co-morbid obsessive compulsive disorder, mood, and anxiety disorders". ''Adv Neurol.'' 2006;99:208<U+2013>21. PMID 16536368</ref> and there is increasing evidence supporting the use of [[Habit reversal training|habit reversal]] in the treatment of tics.<ref>Himle MB, Woods DW, Piacentini JC, Walkup JT.

PMID 16970874</ref> [[Relaxation technique]]s, such as exercise, yoga or meditation, may be useful in relieving the stress that may aggravate tics, but the majority of behavioral interventions (such as relaxation training and [[biofeedback]], with the exception of habit reversal) have not been systematically evaluated and are not empirically supported therapies for Tourette's.<ref>Woods DW, Himle MB, Conelea CA.

Tourette syndrome is a spectrum disorder<U+2014>its severity ranges over a spectrum from mild to severe.  The majority of cases are mild and require no treatment.<ref name=TSAWhat/>  In these cases, the impact of symptoms on the individual may be mild, to the extent that casual observers might not know of their condition. The overall prognosis is positive, but a minority of children with Tourette syndrome have severe symptoms that persist into adulthood.<ref name=AN2intro>Walkup JT, Mink JW, Hollenback PJ, (eds). ''Advances in Neurology, Vol. 99, Tourette Syndrome.''  Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA, 2006, p. xv.</ref>  A study of 46 subjects at 19 years of age found that the symptoms of 80% had minimum to mild impact on their overall functioning, and that the other 20% experienced at least a moderate impact on their overall functioning.<ref name=phenomenology/>  The rare minority of severe cases can inhibit or prevent individuals from holding a job or having a fulfilling social life. In a follow-up study of thirty-one adults with Tourette's, all patients completed high school, 52% finished at least two years of college, and 71% were full-time employed or were pursuing higher education.<ref name=outcome>Pappert EJ, Goetz CG, Louis ED, ''et al.'' "Objective assessments of longitudinal outcome in Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome."  ''Neurology.'' 2003 Oct 14;61(7):936<U+2013>40. PMID 14557563</ref>

Regardless of symptom severity, individuals with Tourette's have a normal [[Life expectancy|life span]].  Although the symptoms may be lifelong and chronic for some, the condition is not [[Degeneration (medical)|degenerative]] or life-threatening.  [[intelligence (trait)|Intelligence]] is normal in those with Tourette's, although there may be learning disabilities.<ref name=SingerBehavior/>  Severity of tics early in life does not predict tic severity in later life,<ref name=SingerBehavior/> and prognosis is generally favorable,<ref name=SingerBehavior/> although there is no reliable means of predicting the outcome for a particular individual. The gene or genes associated with Tourette's have not been identified, and there is no potential "cure".<ref name=SingerBehavior/>  A higher rate of [[migraine]]s then the general population and [[sleep disorder|sleep disturbances]] are reported.<ref name=SingerBehavior/>  

Several studies have demonstrated that the condition in most children improves with maturity.  Tics may be at their highest severity at the time that they are diagnosed, and often improve with understanding of the condition by individuals and their families and friends.  The statistical age of highest tic severity is typically between eight and twelve, with most individuals experiencing steadily declining tic severity as they pass through adolescence.  One study showed no correlation with tic severity and the onset of puberty, in contrast with the popular belief that tics increase at puberty. In many cases, a complete remission of tic symptoms occurs after adolescence.<ref name=YaleTicSeverity/><ref>Burd L, Kerbeshian PJ, Barth A, ''et al.''  "Long-term follow-up of an epidemiologically defined cohort of patients with Tourette syndrome". ''J Child Neurol''. 2001;16(6):431<U+2013>37. PMID 11417610</ref>  However, a study using videotape to record tics in adults found that, although tics diminished in comparison with childhood, and all measures of tic severity improved by adulthood, 90% of adults still had tics. Half of the adults who considered themselves tic-free still displayed evidence of tics.<ref name=outcome/>

It is not uncommon for the parents of affected children to be unaware that they, too, may have had tics as children.  Because Tourette's tends to subside with maturity, and because milder cases of Tourette's are now more likely to be recognized, the first realization that a parent had tics as a child may not come until their offspring is diagnosed. It is not uncommon for several members of a family to be diagnosed together, as parents bringing children to a physician for an evaluation of tics become aware that they, too, had tics as a child.

Children with Tourette's may suffer socially if their tics are viewed as "bizarre".  If a child has disabling tics, or tics that interfere with social or academic functioning, supportive [[psychotherapy]] or school accommodations can be helpful.<ref name=TSAFAQ/> Because [[comorbid]] conditions (such as ADHD or OCD) can cause greater impact on overall functioning than tics, a thorough evaluation for comorbidity is called for when symptoms and impairment warrant.<ref name=Bagheri/>

A supportive environment and family generally gives those with Tourette's the skills to manage the disorder.<ref>Leckman & Cohen (1999), p. 37. "For example, individuals who were misunderstood and punished at home and at school for their tics or who were teased mercilessly by peers and stigmatized by their communities will fare worse than a child whose interpersonal environment was more understanding and supportive."</ref><ref>Cohen DJ, Leckman JF, Pauls D.  "Neuropsychiatric disorders of childhood: Tourette<U+2019>s syndrome as a model". ''Acta Paediatr Suppl'' 422; 106<U+2013>11, Scandinavian University Press, 1997.  "The individuals with TS who do the best, we believe, are: those who have been able to feel relatively good about themselves and remain close to their families; those who have the capacity for humor and for friendship; those who are less burdened by troubles with attention and behavior, particularly aggression; and those who have not had development derailed by medication."</ref>  People with Tourette's may learn to camouflage socially inappropriate tics or to channel the energy of their tics into a functional endeavor.  [[Sociological and cultural aspects of Tourette syndrome#Notable individuals|Accomplished musicians, athletes, public speakers, and professionals]] from all walks of life are found among people with Tourette's. Outcomes in adulthood are associated more with the perceived significance of having severe tics as a child than with the actual severity of the tics. A person who was misunderstood, punished, or teased at home or at school will fare worse than children who enjoyed an understanding and supportive environment.<ref name=phenomenology/>

==Epidemiology==
Tourette syndrome is found among all social, racial and ethnic groups,<ref name=NIH/> has been reported in all parts of the world,<ref name=Robertson-1-2008/> and is three to four times more frequent among males than among females.<ref>Bagheri, Kerbeshian and Burd (1999) report that TS is "three to nine times more frequent in males than in females". Zinner (2000) says, "Data from most studies suggest ... [a] male:female ratio typically ranging from 2:1 to 4:1." Leckman & Cohen (1999), p. 180, Table 10.1 report a range based on six studies of 1.6:1 to 9.3:1 male:female ratio. Robertson part 1 (2008), p. 465 says, "All studies agree that GTS occurs more in males than in females, with a figure of approximately 4:1." The most commonly reported ratio (3:1 to 4:1) is from the Tourette Syndrome Association's "What is Tourette syndrome?" and the NINDS/NIH Tourette Syndrome Fact Sheet.</ref> The tics of Tourette syndrome begin in childhood and tend to remit or subside with maturity; thus, a diagnosis may no longer be warranted for many adults, and [[prevalence]] is much higher among children than adults.<ref name=YaleTicSeverity/> Children are five to twelve times more likely than adults to be identified as having [[tic disorder]]s;<ref>Leckman JF, Peterson BS, Pauls DL, Cohen DJ.

In 1885, Gilles de la Tourette published an account of nine patients, ''Study of a Nervous Affliction'', concluding that a new clinical category should be defined.<ref>Gilles de la Tourette G, Goetz CG, Llawans HL, trans.

Little progress was made over the next century in explaining or treating tics, and a psychogenic view prevailed well into the 20th century.<ref name=emed/>  The possibility that movement disorders, including Tourette syndrome, might have an [[organic disease|organic origin]] was raised when an [[encephalitis]] [[epidemic]] from 1918<U+2013>1926 led to a subsequent epidemic of tic disorders.<ref name=Pagewise>Blue, Tina.

During the 1960s and 1970s, as the beneficial effects of [[haloperidol]] (Haldol) on tics became known, the psychoanalytic approach to Tourette syndrome was questioned.<ref>Rickards H, Hartley N, Robertson MM. "Seignot's paper on the treatment of Tourette's syndrome with haloperidol. Classic Text No. 31".  ''Hist Psychiatry.'' 1997 Sep;8 (31 Pt 3):433<U+2013>36.

Since the 1990s, a more neutral view of Tourette's has emerged, in which biological vulnerability and adverse environmental events are seen to interact.<ref name=Zinner/><ref name=emed/>  In 2000, the [[American Psychiatric Association]] published the DSM-IV-TR, revising the text of DSM-IV to no longer require that symptoms of tic disorders cause distress or impair functioning.<ref>[http://www.psychnet-uk.com/dsm_iv/_misc/what_is_dsm_iv_tr.htm What is DSM-IV-TR?] Psychnet-UK. Retrieved on May 14, 2007.</ref>

Findings since 1999 have advanced TS science in the areas of genetics, [[neuroimaging]], [[neurophysiology]], and [[neuropathology]].  Questions remain regarding how best to classify Tourette syndrome, and how closely Tourette's is related to other movement disorders or [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] disorders.  Good [[epidemiologic]] data is still lacking, and [[Treatment of Tourette syndrome|available treatments]] are not risk free and not always well tolerated.<ref name=ANResearch>Walkup JT, Mink JW, Hollenback PJ, (eds). (2006) pp. xvi<U+2013>xviii</ref>  High-profile media coverage focuses on treatments that do not have established safety or efficacy, such as [[deep brain stimulation]], and alternative therapies involving unstudied efficacy and side effects are pursued by many parents.<ref name=Swerdlow/>
