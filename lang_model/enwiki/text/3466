Pakistan is the [[List of countries by population|sixth most populous country]]  in the world and is the [[Islam by country|second most populous country with a Muslim majority]]. Its territory was a part of [[partition of India|pre-partitioned]] [[British India]], and has a long history of settlement and civilisation including the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]]. Most of it <!-- the territory --> was conquered in the [[1st millennium BC]] by [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] and [[Indo-Greek|Greeks]]. Later arrivals include the [[Arabs]], [[Afghan]]s, [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[Baloch]] and [[Mongols]]. The territory was incorporated into the [[British Raj]] in the nineteenth century. Since its [[Independence of Pakistan|independence]], the country has experienced both periods of significant military and economic growth, and periods of instability, with the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|secession]] of [[East Pakistan]] (present-day [[Bangladesh]]). Pakistan is a [[List of countries with nuclear weapons|declared nuclear weapons state]].

== Etymology ==
The name "Pakistan" ({{IPA2|pa<U+02D0>k<U+026A>st<U+032A>a<U+02D0>n}}) means "[[-stan|Land of the Pure]]" in [[Sindhi]], [[Urdu]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. It was coined in 1934 by [[Choudhary Rahmat Ali]], who published it in the pamphlet ''[[Now or Never]]''<ref name="pamphlet">[http://www.zyworld.com/slam33/non.htm Text of the ''Now or Never pamphlet'', issued on [[January 28]], [[1933]]]</ref>.  The name was coined from the names of five territories that were proposed as constituents of a separate country for the Muslims in British India, these territories were previously considered as Afghan or Persian domains from a cultural as well as an ethnic point of view; the territories consisted of P-Punjab, A-Afghania, K-Kashmir, S-Sindh, and Tan/Stan-Balochistan/Tokharistan.<ref name="meaning of Pakistan">[http://www.uh.edu/~sriaz/pakistan/]</ref>  The name also implies that the people of this land are 'pure'. Officially, the nation was founded as the ''Dominion of Pakistan'' in 1947, and was renamed as the ''Islamic Republic of Pakistan'' in 1956.

== History ==
<!-- THIS SECTION IS A SUMMARY. CONSIDER ADDING MATERIAL TO THE 'HISTORY OF PAKISTAN' ARTICLE.-->
{{Main|History of Pakistan}}
Modern day Pakistan consists of four major parts called provinces [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Sind]], [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] and [[NWFP]]. It also governs part of [[Kashmir region|Kashmir]] which is currently split between Pakistan and India. Modern Pakistan is a country that has [[Harappan]], [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]], [[Persian]], [[Greece|Grecian]], [[Saka]], [[Parthian]], [[Kushan]], [[White Hun]], [[Afghan]], [[Arab]], [[Turkic]], and [[Mughal]] heritage. Waves of conquerors and migrants settled down in Pakistan through out the centuries, influencing the locals and being absorbed among them. Pakistan is home to the oldest Asian civilisation (and one of the oldest in the world after Mesopotamia), [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (2500 BC - 1500 BC). The modern state of Pakistan was established on [[14 August]] [[1947]], but the country has an extensive history that overlaps with the histories of [[History of India|Ancient India]], [[History of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] and [[History of Iran|Iran]]. The region is a crossroad of historic trade routes, including the [[Silk Road]], and was settled over thousands of years by many groups, including [[Dravidians]], [[Indo-Aryans]], [[Persians]], [[Ancient Macedonians]], [[Greeks]], [[Scythians]], [[Parthians]] [[Kushans]], [[White Huns]], [[Pashtun people|Afghans]], [[Arab]]s, [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], and [[Mongols]]<!--; the region is often referred to as "a museum of races." Historian and geographer de Blij Muller characterized the historical embodiment of the land when he said, "If, as is so often said, [[Egypt]] is the gift of the [[Nile]], then Pakistan is the gift of the [[Indus]]."-->. The [[Indus River|Indus region]] was the site of several ancient cultures including [[Mehrgarh]], one of the world's earliest known towns, and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] at [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-Daro]].<ref name="indus_valley">[http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/middle_east/mohenjo_daro.html Minnesota State University page on Mohenjo-Daro]</ref> 
[[Image:Badshahi Mosque July 1 2005 pic32 by Ali Imran.jpg|thumb|200px|[[seventeenth century|17th Century]] [[Badshahi Masjid]] built by [[Mughal]] emperor [[Aurangzeb]] in [[Lahore]]]]

The Indus Valley civilization collapsed in the middle of the second millennium BCE and was followed by the [[Vedic Civilisation]], which extended over much of northern India and Pakistan. Successive empires and kingdoms ruled the region from the [[Achaemenid]] Persian empire<ref name="achaemenid">[http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/achaemenians.html Livius.org on the extent of the Achaemenid Empire]</ref> around 543 BCE, to [[Alexander the Great]]<ref name="plutarch">[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/8.html#ref98 Plutarch's ''Life of Alexander'']</ref> in 326 BCE and the [[Mauryan]] empire. The [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] founded by [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius of Bactria]] included [[Gandhara]] and [[Punjab region|Punjab]] from 184 BCE, and reached its greatest extent under [[Menander I|Menander]], establishing the [[Greco-Buddhism|Greco-Buddhist]] period with advances in trade and culture. The city of [[Taxila]] (Takshashila) became a major centre of learning in ancient times - the remains of the city, located to the west of [[Islamabad]], are one of the country's major archaeological sites.

In 712 [[Common Era|CE]], the Arab general [[Muhammad bin Qasim]]<ref name="qasim">[http://www.infinityfoundation.com/ECITChachnamaframeset.htm Infinity Foundation's translation of the Chach-Nama]</ref> conquered [[Sindh]] and [[Multan]] in southern [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], setting the stage for several successive Muslim empires including the [[Ghaznavid Empire]], the [[Muhammad of Ghor|Ghorid]] Kingdom, the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and the [[Mughal Empire]]. During this period [[Sufi]] missionaries played a pivotal role in converting a majority of the regional Buddhist and Hindu population to [[Islam]]. The gradual decline of the Mughal Empire in the early eighteenth century provided opportunities for the [[Durrani Empire|Afghans]], [[Balochis]] and [[Sikhs]] to exercise control over large areas until the [[British East India Company]]<ref name="east_india">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/pktoc.html Library of Congress study of Pakistan]</ref> gained ascendancy over South Asia. 

[[Image:GGJinnah.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Governor General]] [[Jinnah]] delivering the opening address on [[11 August]] [[1947]] to the new state of Pakistan.]]
The [[Indian War of Independence|War of Independence]], also known as the Indian Mutiny, in [[1857]] was the region's last major armed struggle against the British Raj, and it laid the foundations for the generally unarmed freedom struggle led by the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]]. However, the [[All India Muslim League|Muslim League]] rose to popularity in the late 1930s amid fears of under-representation and neglect of Muslims in politics. On [[29 December]] [[1930]], [[Allama Iqbal]]'s presidential address called for a separate Muslim state in northwest and eastern [[South Asia]]. [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] espoused the ''[[Two Nation Theory]]'' and led the Muslim League to adopt the ''[[Lahore Resolution]]''<ref name="resolution">[http://www.jang.com.pk/thenews/spedition/23%20march%202005/index.htm#d Jang.com page on the Lahore Resolution]</ref> of 1940 (popularly known as [[Pakistan Resolution]]), which ultimately led to the creation of Pakistan.

[[Image:PAK1971.JPG|200px|thumb|The two wings of Pakistan in 1970; [[East Pakistan]] separated from the West wing in 1971 as an independent [[Bangladesh]].]]
Pakistan was formed on [[14 August]] [[1947]] with two Muslim-majority wings in the eastern and northwestern regions of [[British India]], separated from the rest of British India with a Hindu majority, and comprising the provinces of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], [[East Bengal]], the [[North-West Frontier Province]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|West Punjab]] and [[Sindh]]. The [[Partition of India|partition of British India]] resulted in communal riots<ref name="1947riots">[http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat3.htm#India Estimates for the 1947 death toll]</ref> across India and Pakistan&mdash;millions of Muslims moved to Pakistan and millions of Hindus and [[Sikhs]] moved to India. Disputes arose over several princely states including [[Jammu and Kashmir]] whose ruler had acceded to India, while the majority of the population favored independence, leading to the [[First Kashmir War]] (1948) ending with Pakistan occupying roughly one-third of the state. From 1947 to 1956, Pakistan was a [[Dominion]] in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. The republic declared in 1956 was stalled by a [[coup d'etat]] by [[Ayub Khan]] (1958&ndash;69), who was president during a period of internal instability and a [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|second war]] with India in 1965. His successor, [[Yahya Khan]] (1969&ndash;71) had to deal with the [[1970 Bhola cyclone|cyclone]] which caused 500,000 deaths<ref name="cyclone">[http://nirapad.org/care_nirapad/Home/Magazine/chronology/currentissue/html/news8.html "Community participation in disaster management can reduce the losses"]</ref> in East Pakistan. 

Economic and political dissent in [[East Pakistan]] led to violent political repression and tensions escalating into [[civil war]]<ref name="1971war">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/south_asia/2002/india_pakistan/timeline/1971.stm 1971 war summary by BBC website]</ref> ([[Bangladesh Liberation War]]) and the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]] and ultimately the secession of East Pakistan as the independent state of [[Bangladesh]].<ref name="Bangladesh">[http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/17.htm US Country Studies article on the Bangladesh War]</ref> 

Civilian rule resumed from 1972 to 1977 under [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], until he was deposed and later sentenced to death in what amounted to a judicial murder in 1979 by General [[Zia-ul-Haq]], who became the third military president. Pakistan's [[secular]] policies were replaced by Zia's introduction of the Islamic [[Shariat|Shariah]] legal code, which increased religious influences on the civil service and the military. With the death of General Zia in a plane crash in 1988, [[Benazir Bhutto]], daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was elected as the first female Prime Minister of Pakistan. Over the next decade, she alternated power with [[Nawaz Sharif]], as the country's political and economic situation worsened. Pakistan sent 5,000 troops to the 1991 [[Gulf War]] as part of a US led coalition and specifically for the defence of [[Saudi Arabia]].<ref name="gulf_war">[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/09/24/MN168392.DTL  The 1991 Gulf war]</ref> Military tensions in the [[Kargil War|Kargil conflict]]<ref name="kargil">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/352995.stm Kargil conflict timeline on the BBC website]</ref> with India were followed by a [[1999 Pakistani coup d'<U+00E9>tat|Pakistani military coup d'<U+00E9>tat in 1999]] <ref name="1999coup">[http://www.news.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1999/10/13/wcoo13.html Daily Telegraph (UK) article on the 1999 coup]</ref> in which General [[Pervez Musharraf]] assumed executive powers. In 2001, Musharraf named himself [[President of Pakistan|President]] after the forced resignation of [[Rafiq Tarar]]. After the 2002 parliamentary elections, Musharraf transferred executive powers to newly elected Prime Minister [[Zafarullah Khan Jamali]], who was succeeded in the 2004 Prime-Ministerial election by a professional banker [[Shaukat Aziz]], followed by a brief (temporary) stint in the seat by Chaudhy Shuja'at Hussain.

== Government and politics ==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{main|Government of Pakistan|Politics of Pakistan}}
The [[Muslim League]] formed Pakistan's first government under the leadership of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] and [[Liaquat Ali Khan]]. The Muslim League's leadership of Pakistani politics decreased significantly with the rise of other political parties, with the [[Pakistan People's Party]] in West Pakistan, and the [[Awami League]] in East Pakistan, which would ultimately lead to the creation of Bangladesh. The first [[Constitution of Pakistan]] was adopted in 1956, but was suspended in 1958 by [[Ayub Khan]]. The Constitution of 1973, suspended in 1977 by [[Zia-ul-Haq]], was re-instated in 1991 and is the country's most important document, laying the foundations of government. Pakistan is a [[federal]] [[democratic republic]] with [[Islam]] as the state religion. The [[semi-presidential system]] includes a [[bicameral]] legislature consisting of a 100-member [[Senate of Pakistan|Senate]] and a 342-member [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]]. The [[President of Pakistan|President]] is the [[Head of State]] and the [[Commander in Chief]] of the Armed Forces and is elected by an [[Electoral College of Pakistan|electoral college]]. The [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|prime minister]] is usually the leader of the largest party in the National Assembly. Each province has a similar system of government with a directly elected Provincial Assembly in which the leader of the largest party or alliance becomes Chief Minister. Provincial Governors are appointed by the President. 
[[Image:ParliamentHouse.jpg|thumb|200px|Parliament house in [[Islamabad]]]]

The [[Military of Pakistan|Pakistani military]] has played an influential role in mainstream politics throughout Pakistan's history, ([[Politics of Pakistan]]) with military presidents ruling from 1958&ndash;71, 1977&ndash;88 and from 1999 onwards. The leftist Pakistan People's Party (PPP), led by [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], emerged as a major political player during the 1970s. Under the military rule of [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], Pakistan began a marked shift from the British-era secular politics and policies, to the adoption of [[Shariat]] and other laws based on Islam. During the 1980s, the anti-[[feudal]], pro-[[Muhajir Urdu|Muhajir]] [[Muttahida Qaumi Movement]] (MQM) was started by unorthodox and educated urban dwellers of [[Sindh]] and particularly [[Karachi]]. The 1990s were characterized by coalition politics dominated by the PPP and a rejuvenated Muslim League. 

In the October 2002 general elections, the [[Pakistan Muslim League (Q)]] (PML-Q) won a [[plurality]] of National Assembly seats with the second-largest group being the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|Pakistan People's Party Parliamentarians]] (PPPP), a sub-party of the PPP. [[Zafarullah Khan Jamali]] of PML-Q emerged as Prime Minister but resigned on [[26 June]] [[2004]] and was replaced by PML-Q leader [[Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain]] as interim Prime Minister. On [[28 August]], [[2004]] the National Assembly voted 191 to 151 to elect the [[Finance Minister of Pakistan|Finance Minister]] and former [[Citibank]] Vice President [[Shaukat Aziz]] as Prime Minister. [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal]], a coalition of Islamic religious parties, won elections in [[North-West Frontier Province]], and increased their representation in the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]].

[[Image:BUSHPERVEZ.jpg|200px|thumb|US President [[George W. Bush]] and [[Musharraf|President Musharraf]] answer reporters in the [[East Room]] of the [[White House]] in late 2006.]]
Pakistan is an active member of the [[United Nations]] (UN) and the [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC), the latter of which Pakistan has used as a forum for ''Enlightened Moderation'',<ref name="enlightened_moderation>[http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/EnlightenedModeration.aspx President Musharraf on Enlightened Moderation]</ref> a plan to promote a [[renaissance]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] in the Muslim world. Pakistan is also a member of the major regional organisations of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) and the [[Economic Cooperation Organisation]] (ECO). In the past, Pakistan has had mixed relations with the United States especially in the early 1950s when Pakistan was the United States' "most allied ally in Asia"<ref name="mostallied">[http://www.fpa.org/newsletter_info2583/newsletter_info_sub_list.htm?section=Pakistan%3A%20The%20Most%20Allied%20Ally%20in%20Asia Pakistan: The Most Allied Ally in Asia]</ref> and a member of both the [[Central Treaty Organisation]] (CENTO) and the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation]] (SEATO). During the [[Soviet-Afghan War]] in the 1980s Pakistan was a crucial US ally, but relations soured in the 1990s, when sanctions were applied by the US over suspicions of Pakistan's nuclear activities. The [[September 11 attacks]] and the subsequent [[War on Terrorism]] have seen an improvement in US&ndash;Pakistan ties, especially after Pakistan ended its support of the [[Taliban]] regime in [[Kabul]]. In January 2004, founder of Pakistani nuclear program [[A. Q. Khan]] confessed of nuclear proliferation to [[Libya]], [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]]. On [[5 February]] [[2004]], the president [[Pervez Musharraf]], announced that he had pardoned A. Q. Khan.  At present, A. Q. Khan is ailing and under house arrest.

Pakistan has long had troubled relations with [[Relations between India and Pakistan|neighbouring India]]. The long-running dispute over [[Kashmir]] resulted in full fledged wars in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]] and [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]]. Civil war in 1971 flared into the simultaneous [[Bangladeshi Liberation War]] and the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. Pakistan conducted [[Nuclear testing|nuclear weapon tests]] in 1998 to counterbalance India's nuclear explosion ([[Smiling Buddha]]) of [[1974]] and [[Pokhran-II]] of 1998 respectively.<ref>[http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=M1ARTM0011704 The Canadian Encyclopedia Historica, India's Nuclear Test] Maclean's Magazine, William Lowther, Nomi Morris, and Sankarshan Thakur, 25 May 1998</ref> and became the only Muslim [[declared nuclear states|nuclear weapons state]]. The relations with India are steadily improving following peace initiatives in 2002. Pakistan maintains close [[economic]], [[military]] and [[political]] relationships with the [[People's Republic of China]]. 

Pakistan also faces instability in the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]], where some tribal leaders support the [[Taliban]]. Pakistan has had to deploy the army in these regions to suppress the local unrest, in [[Waziristan]]. The [[Waziristan conflict]] ended with a recently declared [[Waziristan Accord|peace agreement]] between the tribal leaders and the Pakistani government, that is expected to bring back stability to the region.<ref name="local_unrest">[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2005%5C12%5C31%5Cstory_31-12-2005_pg7_29 'Taliban' gain sway in tribal region]. <u>Daily Times</u>. [[31 December]] [[2005]].</ref>

Additionally, the [[country]] has long faced instability in its largest [[province]], [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]. The army was deployed to fight a serious [[insurgency]] within the province from 1973&ndash;76. Social stability resumed after [[Rahimuddin Khan]] was appointed [[martial law administrator]] beginning in 1977. After relative peace throughout the 1980s and 1990s, some influential Baloch tribal leaders restarted a separatist movement after Pervez Musharraf took over in 1999. In a recent incident [[Nawab Akbar Bugti]], the leader of the [[Baloch]] insurgency, was killed in August 2006 by Pakistani military forces.

== Administrative divisions ==
{{main|Subdivisions of Pakistan}}

[[Image:Sub Pakistan.png|thumb|200px|Provinces and territories of Pakistan]]
Pakistan is a [[federation]]<ref name="federation">[http://www.nrb.gov.pk/constitutional_and_legal/constitution/part1.notes.html#1 The Constitutional basis of the Federation of Pakistan]</ref> of four provinces, a capital territory and federally administered tribal areas. Pakistan exercises ''de facto'' jurisdiction over the western parts of the [[Kashmir]] region, organised as two separate political entities ([[Azad Kashmir]] and [[Northern Areas]]), which are also claimed by India. 

In 2001 the federal government abolished the administrative entities called "[[Divisions of Pakistan|Divisions]]", which used to be the third tier of government. The entities called "[[Districts of Pakistan|Districts]]", which used to be the fourth tier, became the new third tier. The provinces and the capital territory are subdivided into a total of [[Districts of Pakistan|107 districts]] which contain numerous [[tehsil]]s and local governments. The tribal areas comprise seven tribal agencies and six small frontier regions detached from neighbouring districts whilst Azad Kashmir comprises seven districts and Northern Areas comprises six districts.

[[Image:Karachi_at_night.JPEG|thumb|200px|Karachi - the financial capital and the largest city of Pakistan]] 
Pakistan is a rapidly [[developing country]] which has faced a number of challenges on both political and economic fronts. Despite being a very poor country in 1947, Pakistan's economic growth rate was better than the global average during the subsequent four decades, but imprudent policies led to a slowdown in the late 1990s.<ref name="econ_1990s">{{cite web| url=http://www.pakistanstudies-aips.org/en/economy.htm| title=Pakistan Studies; Economy| accessdate=2006-11-20| format=HTML| work=American Institute of Pakistan Studies}}</ref> Recently, wide-ranging economic reforms have resulted in a stronger economic outlook and accelerated growth especially in the [[manufacturing]] and [[financial services]] [[sector]]s. There has been great improvement in the [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] position and rapid growth in [[hard currency]] reserves in recent years.

The growth of non-agricultural sectors has changed the structure of the economy, and agriculture now only accounts for roughly 20% of the GDP. The [[service]] sector accounts for 53% of the country's GDP with [[wholesale]] and [[retail]] trade forming 30% of this sector. In recent times, the [[Karachi Stock Exchange]] has soared, along with most of the world's [[emerging markets]]. Large amounts of foreign investments have been made into several industries. The top industries in Pakistan are [[telecom]], [[software]], [[automotives]], [[textiles]], [[cement]], [[fertilizer]], [[steel]], [[ship building]], and more recently, [[aerospace]].

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Pakistan}}
[[Image:Pakistan ethnic 80.jpg|thumb|250px|Major Ethnic Groups in Pakistan and surrounding areas, 1980]]
Pakistan has an estimated population of 169,270,617, as of in 2007.<ref name="US Census Bureau">[http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idbprint.html International Data Base] U.S. Census Bureau. URL accessed on [[5 May]] [[2006]].</ref> Pakistan has the world's sixth largest population, placing it higher than [[Russia]], and lower than [[Brazil]]. Because of Pakistan's high growth rate, it is expected to surpass [[Brazil]] in population in the year [[2020]]. Population projections for Pakistan are relatively difficult because of the apparent differences in the accuracy of each census and the inconsistencies between various surveys related to the fertility rate, but it is likely that the rate of growth peaked in the 1980s and has since declined significantly.<ref name="population">[http://www.gfeeney.com/pubs/2003-pakistan-fertility-2/2003-pakistan-fertility-2.pdf Feeney and Alam, 2003]</ref> The population was estimated at 162,400,000<ref name="prb">[http://www.prb.org/pdf05/05WorldDataSheet_Eng.pdf Population Reference Bureau's 2005 World Data Sheet]</ref> on [[July 1]], [[2005]], with a fertility rate of 34 per thousand, a death rate of 10 per thousand, and the rate of natural increase at 2.4%. Pakistan also has a high infant mortality rate of 70 per thousand births.<ref name="US Census Bureau">[http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idbprint.html International Data Base] U.S. Census Bureau. URL accessed on [[17 October]] [[2006]].</ref>

The demographics of religion in Pakistan were significantly influenced in 1947 by the movement of Muslims to Pakistan, and Hindus and Sikhs to India. Census data <ref name="census">[http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/pco/statistics/other_tables/pop_by_mother_tongue.pdf Census results for languages of Pakistan]</ref> indicates that 96% of the population are [[Islam in Pakistan|Muslim]]s, of whom nearly 80% are [[Sunni Muslims]] and [[Shi'a population|19%]] are [[Shi'a Muslims]]. The remainder comprises [[Christianity in Pakistan|Christians]], [[Hinduism in Pakistan|Hindus]], [[History of the Jews in Pakistan|Jew]]s, [[Sikh]]s, [[Parsi]]s, [[Ahmadi]]s, [[Buddhist]]s, and [[Animist]]s (mainly the [[Kalasha of Chitral]]). Pakistan is the second most populous [[Islam by country#Top sixty|Muslim-majority country]]<ref name="ayres">Robert Ayres, Turning Point: The End of the Growth Paradigm, James & James/Earthscan, 1998, pp. 63. ISBN 1853834394</ref> and also has the one of the largest [[Shi'a population]]s of any country. As of 2006, an estimated 2.5 million refugees &mdash; approximately 81.5% being ethnic [[Pashtuns]] &mdash; remain in Pakistan as a result of the wars in [[Afghanistan]].<ref>AFGHANISTAN-PAKISTAN: ''Registration of Afghan refugees to start'' - [[UNHCR]]...[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=55525&SelectRegion=Asia Link]</ref>

[[Urdu]] is the [[Languages of Pakistan|national language]] and ''[[lingua franca]]'' of Pakistan despite being a non-native Pakistani language, and was installed and promoted by the British Raj in the mid 1800s to supplant the [[Farsi]] ([[Persian]] language) formerly spoken for some 2000 years and to tie the western former [[Afghan]], [[Central Asian]], [[Persian]] or previously autonomous regions( [[Panjab]], [[Sindh]], [[Balochistan]], [[Kalat]], [[Bahawalpur]], [[Kashmir]] and [[NWFP]] etc.) to the mainland Asian Subcontinent and the British Raj headquartered in Delhi, while [[English language|English]] is the [[official language]], used in the [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]] and widely used by corporate businesses, the educated urban elite, and most universities. [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] is spoken by over 60 million people, but has no official recognition in the country.<ref name=Punjabi> [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=pnb Ethnologue Western Punjabi]</ref> 

These major ethnic groups are further broken down into several smaller ethnic groups - [[Punjabis]] (44.68)% of the population, [[Pashtuns]] (15.42%), [[Sindhis]] (14.1%), [[Seraikis]] (10.53%), [[Muhajir Urdu|Muhajir]]s (7.57%), [[Balochis]] (3.57%) and others (4.66%).  It should be noted that the continued use of [[Urdu]] as the national language, though while facilitating interprovincial and inter-regional communication within Pakistan, has caused much resistance amongst Pakistan's several dominant ethnic groups particularly the Pushtuns, Sindhis, Balochis and more recently, amongst educated Punjabis.  While the Punjabis have traditionally been supportive of Urdu especially during the early years after independence, they have recently acknowledged its failure and have shown a tendency to identify and empathize themsleves more with Pakistani's speaking one the  indigenous languages found in the country([[Pushto]], [[Balochi]], [[Sindhi]], [[Kashmiri]], [[Seraiki]], [[Persian]]), this is most evident in the 'nouveau' educated class of [[Panjab]] who are keen on promoting their indigenous language and reverse the early damage done by their overeagerness to acquire Urdu over their maternal tongue.  This has often placed indigenous Pakistanis at odds with the minority refugee community known as the [[Mohajir]] from India. These groups, point to the fact that despite having residing in the country since independence in 1947 and given significant economic and political advantages particularly in the early formalative years, the [[Mohajir]] minority have failed to adopt or acquire any of the local languages in the areas they were settled in, particularly in the province of [[Sindh]] but also in urban centers of [[Quetta]], [[Peshawar]], [[Lahore]] and [[Multan]].  This has fueled the debate that the minority community has failed to adapt to the regional social dynamics of their respective regions further alienating them from the indigenous population and likely to marginalize them further, a classic example of this, was the civil strife observed in Karachi, Sindh in the early 1980s and Hyderabad pitting [[Sindhis]], [[Panjabi]]'s and [[Pukhtun]]'s against the non-conformist [[Mohajir]] community. Furthermore, many in Pakistan see Urdu as a limited national language, having failed to give the Pakistani nation a strong identifying characteristic, and has failed to bring to preserve its unique local cultures such as those of the [[Punjabis]], [[Sindhis]], [[Pashtuns]] and [[Baloch]].  They claim, that rather than strengthening the culture(s) of the country, it has caused considerably damage to the spoken native languages. Also, many blame the imposition of Urdu as a national language, as being a major factor in the marginalization of the Bengali population of former [[East Pakistan]]. Furthermore, the biggest supporters of Urdu are the [[Muhajirs]] and their descendants, who though share no attachment to the land(rural) of Pakistan and are mostly urbanized represent less than 7% of the countries population. Despite this, Urdu in Pakistan is evolving into a Pakistani variant of the language, recently borrowing words from [[Punjabi]], [[Pashto]], [[English language|English]], modern [[Arabic]] and [[Sindhi]] amongst others. Currently in Pakistan, [[Urdu]] is tied to the Muslim refugees who migrated from India at the time of independence in 1947, and as such, is considered by the indigenous population(>92%) to be an impure language mixing borrowed Persian vocabulary with indigenous Indian languages(Sanskrit) of Delhi, Hyderabad and other former  regions in India previously ruled by foreign Muslim conquerors.  As a result, many in the country fail to see the importance of the language, preferring to retain only English and promoting regional languages. Many purists even feel strongly for the need to reintroduce [[Farsi]]([[Persian]]) as the lingua franca and official language of Pakistanis, due to its historical role as a unifying language among Muslims in pre-colonial [[India]], as well as for restoring ties with neighboring [[Muslim]] civilizations such as [[Persia]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Turco-Persian]] [[Central Asia]].<ref name="The Language Movement of Pakistan">[http://www.geocities.com/paklanguage/index.html]</ref>

== Society and culture ==
{{main|Culture of Pakistan}}
[[Image:Faisal masjid isla galleryfull.jpeg|thumb|200px|[[King Faisal Mosque]] in [[Islamabad]], one of the largest in the world]]

The national dress of [[Shalwar Kameez]] is originally of [[Central Asian]] origin derived from [[Turko-Iranian]] nomadic invaders and is today worn in all parts of Pakistan. The [[sari]] is regional dress that is worn by many women in [[Sindh]] and parts of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Pakistan]]. Women wear brightly coloured shalwar qameez, while men often wear solid-coloured ones.

The variety of [[Music of Pakistan|Pakistani music]] ranges from diverse provincial [[folk music]] and traditional styles such as [[Qawwali]] and [[Ghazal|Ghazal Gayaki]] to modern forms fusing traditional and western music, such as the synchronisation of Qawwali and western music by the renowned [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]]. Other major [[Ghazal]] singers include [[Mehdi Hassan]], [[Ghulam Ali]], [[Farida Khanum]], [[Tahira Syed]], [[Abida Parveen]] and [[Iqbal Bano]]. [[Hip-Hop]] is one of the categories in Pakistan that is rising very fast, especially rappers [[2Pac]], [[50 Cent]], and [[The Game]] are known throughout the whole country by many elementary schoolers and teenagers. The arrival of [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] refugees in the western provinces has rekindled [[Pashto]] and [[Persians|Persian]] music and established [[Peshawar]] as a hub for Afghan musicians and a distribution centre for Afghan music abroad. Until the 1990s, the state-owned [[Pakistan Television Corporation]] (PTV) and [[Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation]] were the dominant media outlets, but there are now numerous [[List of Pakistani TV and radio Channels|private television channels]] such as [[Geo TV]], [[Indus News|Indus TV]], [[Hum TV|Hum]], [[ARY Group|ARY]], [[KTN]] and others. Various American, European, and Asian television channels and movies such as [[AXN]], [[Star Plus]] are available to the majority of the Pakistani population via private Television Networks ([[MTV Pakistan]] is controlled by Indus Network, etc.), [[cable TV|cable]], and [[satellite television]]. There are also small indigenous movie industries based in Lahore and Peshawar (often referred to as [[Lollywood]] and [[Pollywood]]). Although [[Bollywood]] movies are banned since 1965,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4639216.stm Pakistan to show Bollywood film] Pakistan banned Indian movies following the [[Second Kashmir War|1965 war]] </ref> Indian film stars are generally popular in Pakistan.  	 
 		 
Pakistani society is largely [[multilingual]] and predominantly [[Muslim]], with high regard for traditional family values, although urban families have grown into a [[nuclear family]] system due to the socio-economic constraints imposed by the traditional [[joint family]] system. Recent decades have seen the emergence of a middle class in cities like [[Karachi]], [[Lahore]], [[Rawalpindi]], [[Hyderabad, Pakistan|Hyderabad]], [[Faisalabad]], [[Sukkur]] and [[Peshawar]] that wish to move in a more liberal direction,<ref name="secular_middle">Beinart, Peter. "Understate". <u>The New Republic Online</u>.

Tourism is a growing industry in Pakistan, based on its diverse cultures, peoples and landscapes. The variety of attractions range from the ruins of ancient civilizations such as [[Mohenjo-daro]], [[Harappa]] and [[Taxila]], to the Himalayan hill stations, which attract those interested in field and winter sports. Pakistan is home to several [[Mountain ranges of Pakistan|mountain peaks]] over 7000m, which attracts adventurers and mountaineers from around the world, especially [[K2]]<ref name="mountains">[http://www.tourism.gov.pk/mountain.html PTDC page on mountaineering]</ref>. The northern parts of Pakistan have many old fortresses, towers and other architecture as well as the [[Hunza Valley|Hunza]] and [[Chitral]] valleys, the latter being home to the small pre-Islamic [[Animist]] [[Kalasha]] community who claim descent from the army of [[Alexander the Great]]. In the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] is the site of Alexander's [[battle of the Hydaspes River|battle]] on the [[Jhelum River]] and the historic city [[Lahore]], Pakistan's cultural capital with many examples of [[Mughal]] architecture such as the [[Badshahi Masjid]], [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens]], [[Tomb of Jahangir]] and the [[Lahore Fort]]. To promote Pakistan's unique and various cultural heritage, the prime minister launched "Visit Pakistan 2007". <ref name="Visit Pakistan 2007">[http://doodhpatti.blogspot.com/2006/10/visit-pakistan-year-2007-events.html Events taking place during 2007, Press released by Tourism of Pakistan]</ref>

There are many festivals celebrated annually in Pakistan which may or may not observe as holidays e.g. Pakistan Day ([[23 March]])(holiday), Independence Day ([[14 August]])(holiday), Defence of Pakistan Day ([[6 September]]), Pakistan Air Force Day ([[7 September]]), the anniversaries of the birth ([[25 December]])(holiday) and death ([[11 September]]) of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah|Quaid-e-Azam]](holiday), [[Allama Iqbal]] ([[9 November]]) and the birth ([[30 July]]) and death ([[8 July]]) of [[Fatima Jinnah|Madar-e-Millat]]. [[Labour Day]] (also known as [[May Day]]) is also observed in Pakistan on [[1 May]] (holiday). 	 

Several important festivals are celebrated by Pakistani Muslims during the year, dependent on the [[Islamic calendar]]. [[Ramadan]], the ninth month of the calendar, is characterised by daytime fasting for 29 or 30 days and is followed by the festival of [[Eid ul-Fitr]]. In a second festival, [[Eid ul-Adha]], an animal is sacrificed in remembrance of the actions of Prophet [[Abraham]] (Arabic: Ibrahim) and the meat is shared with friends, family, and the less fortunate. Both Eid festivals are public holidays, serving as opportunities for people to visit family and friends, and for children to receive new clothes, presents, and sweets. Muslims celebrate [[Milad al-Nabi|Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi]], the birthday of the prophet [[Muhammad]], in the third month of the calendar ([[Rabi' al-Awwal]] (holiday)). [[Shi'a Islam|Shia Muslims]] mark the [[Day of Ashurah]] on the 9th and 10th days of the first month ([[Muharram]] (holiday)) to commemorate the martyrdom of [[Husayn bin Ali]], (the grandson of the Prophet [[Muhammad]]). 	 

Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, and Christians in Pakistan also celebrate their own festivals and holidays. [[Sikhs]] come from across the world to visit several holy sites in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], including the shrine of [[Guru Nanak]], the founder of [[Sikhism]], at Hassan Abdal in the [[Attock District]], and his birthplace, at [[Nankana Sahib]]. There are also several regional and local festivals, such as the [[Punjabi]] festival of [[Basant]], which marks the start of spring and is celebrated by kite flying.

{{main|Sports in Pakistan}} 	 
[[Image:Gaddafi.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Gaddafi_Stadium]], one of the largest cricket stadiums in the world]] 	 
The official and national sport of Pakistan is [[field hockey]], although [[squash (sport)|squash]] and [[cricket]] are also very popular. The [[Pakistani cricket team|national cricket team]] has won the [[Cricket World Cup]] once (in [[1992 Cricket World Cup|1992]]), were runners-up once (in [[1999 Cricket World Cup|1999]]), and co-hosted the games twice (in [[1987 Cricket World Cup|1987]] and [[1996 Cricket World Cup|1996]]). Pakistan is also set to host cricket world-cup jointly with [[India]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Sri Lanka]] in 2011. The team has also won the [[Australasia Cup]] thrice (1986, 1990, 1994). Pakistan has produced many famous cricketers, including [[Javed Miandad]], [[Imran Khan]], [[Zaheer Abbas]], [[Hanif Mohammad]], [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]], [[Sarfraz Nawaz]], [[Waqar Younis]] and [[Wasim Akram]]. On [[November 30]], [[2006]] [[Mohammad Yousuf]] broke one of the longest-standing records in cricket, of the most runs scored in a calendar year. 

Pakistan has also produced a number of successful world-class [[Squash (sport)|squash]] players such as [[Jahangir Khan]] and [[Jansher Khan]]. Muhammad Yousuf, not to be confused with the above cricketer, was world amateur [[snooker]] champion in the 1990s. 	 

At an international level, Pakistan has competed many times at the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Olympics]] in field hockey, [[boxing]], [[athletics (track and field)|athletics]], [[swimming]], and [[shooting]]. Pakistan's medal tally remains at 10 medals (3 gold, 3 silver and 4 bronze) while at the Commonwealth games and Asian Games it stands at 61 medals and 182 medals respectively. Hockey is the sport that Pakistan has been most successful at the Olympics, with three gold medals ([[Hockey at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960]], [[Hockey at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[Hockey at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]]). Pakistan has also won the [[Hockey World Cup]] a record four times (1971, 1978, 1982, 1994).<ref name="hockey">[http://www.bharatiyahockey.org/olympics/2004/pakistan.htm Bharatiya Hockey]</ref> Pakistan has hosted several international competitions, including the [[South Asian Federation Games|SAF Games]] in 1989 and 2004. 	 

[[A1 Grand Prix]] racing is also becoming popular with the entry of a [[A1 Team Pakistan|Pakistani team]] in the 2005 season. The [[Tour de Pakistan]], modelled on the [[Tour de France]], is an annual cycling competition that covers the length and breadth of Pakistan. Recently, [[football]] has grown in popularity across the country, although [[Pakistan national football team|the national football team]] is still considered to be very weak and has yet to qualify for a World Cup.
