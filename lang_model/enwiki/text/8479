A small town near the banks of the [[Arkansas River]] in 1901, Tulsa's first oil well, named Sue Bland No. 1,<ref name="Tulsa County History"/> was established that year. By 1905, the discovery of the large Glenn Pool nearby (site of the present day town of [[Glenpool, Oklahoma|Glenpool]]) prompted a rush of entrepreneurs to the area's growing number of oil fields; Tulsa's population swelled to over 140,000 between 1901 and 1930.<ref name="Population of the 100 Largest Cities and Other Urban Places in the United States: 1790 to 1990">{{cite web | date=June 1998 | url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027.html | title= Population of the 100 Largest Cities and Other Urban Places in the United States: 1790 to 1990| first=Campbell | last=Gibson| accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref> Known as the "Oil Capital of the World" for most of the 20th century, the city's success in the energy industry prompted construction booms in the popular [[Art Deco]] style of the time.<ref name="Tulsa History" /> Profits from the oil industry continued through the [[Great Depression]], helping the city's economy fare better than most in the United States during the 1930s.<ref name="Art Deco in Tulsa">{{cite web | url=http://www.tulsalibrary.org/research/artdeco/artdecointulsa.htm| title= What's Doing in Tulsa?| first=Rex | last=Ball | coauthors=Jennifer Young| publisher= Tulsa City-County Library | accessdate=2007-04-25}}</ref>

In the early 20th century, Tulsa was home to "[[Black Wall Street]]," one of the most prosperous [[African American]] communities in the United States at the time.<ref name="Tulsa Race Riot" /> Located in the [[Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma|Greenwood]] neighborhood, it was the site of the [[Tulsa Race Riot]], one of the nation's costliest acts of racial violence and civil disorder.<ref name="Tulsa Race Riot" /> Sixteen hours of rioting on May 31 and June 1, 1921 resulted in over 800 people admitted to local hospitals with injuries, an estimated 10,000 left homeless, 35 city blocks composed of 1,256 residences destroyed by fire, and $1.8 million in property damage.<ref name="Tulsa Race Riot" /> Twenty-three black and 16 white citizens were reported killed, but estimates suggest as many as 300, mostly blacks, died.<ref name="Tulsa Race Riot" />

In 1927, Tulsa businessman [[Cyrus Avery]], known the "Father of Route 66,"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG02/carney/avery.html | title=The Father of Route 66 | publisher=[[University of Virginia]] | accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref> began his campaign to create a road linking [[Chicago]] to [[California]] by establishing the [[U.S. Highway 66 Association]] in Tulsa, earning the city the nickname the "Birthplace of Route 66."<ref name="Route 66" /> Once completed, [[Route 66]] took an important role in Tulsa's development as the city served as a popular rest stop for travelers, who were greeted by Route 66 icons such as the Meadow Gold Sign and the [[Blue Whale of Catoosa]]. During this period, [[Bob Wills]] and his group [[The Texas Playboys]] began their long performing stint at a small ballroom in downtown Tulsa. In 1935, [[Cain's Ballroom]] became the base for the group,<ref name="Cain's Ballroom" /> which is largely credited for creating [[Western Swing]] music. The venue continued to attract famous musicians through its history, and is still in operation today.<ref name="Cain's Ballroom" /> For the remainder of the mid-20th century, a master plan called for the construction of parks, churches, museums, rose gardens, improved infrastructure, and increased national advertising.<ref name="Tulsa History" /> The Spavinaw Dam, built during this era to accommodate the city's water needs, was considered one of the largest public works projects of the era.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tulsaweb.com/tulhist.htm| title=Tulsa's History | publisher= Tulsa Web | accessdate=2007-05-07}}</ref> In the 1950s, Time magazine dubbed Tulsa "America's Most Beautiful City."<ref name="Tulsa History" />

In 2003, the "[[Vision 2025]]" program was approved by voters with the purpose of enhancing and revitalizing Tulsa's infrastructure and tourism industry. The keystone project of the initiative, the [[BOK Center]], was designed to be a home for the city's minor league hockey and arena football teams, as well as a venue for major concerts and conventions.

==Law and government==
{{main|Government of Tulsa, Oklahoma}}

[[Image:Tulsa City Hall 2.JPG|thumb|right|The Tulsa City Hall serves as the base for most city government functions.]]
A [[mayor-council government]] has been in place in Tulsa since 1989 when the city converted from a [[city commission government]] deemed wasteful and less efficient.<ref name="About the Tulsa City Council">{{cite web | url=http://www.tulsacouncil.org/about_cc.php | title=About the Tulsa City Council | publisher=The Tulsa City Council| accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref> Since the change, Tulsa mayors have been given more power in accordance with a [[mayor-council government#Executive or Strong Mayor Form|strong mayoral system]] and have greater control of a more consolidated array of governmental branches.<ref name="About the Tulsa City Council" /> [[Plurality voting system|Plurality voting]] is used to elect mayors, who serve a term in office of four years. The present mayor of Tulsa is [[Kathy Taylor|Kathryn Taylor]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], who previously served as Secretary of Commerce and Tourism for the state of Oklahoma. Taylor unseated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Bill LaFortune|William LaFortune]] in his reelection campaign of April 2006. A notable Tulsa political figure, [[Jim Inhofe]], who represents Oklahoma in the [[United States Senate]], served as the mayor of Tulsa early in his political career.<ref>{{cite news | date=[[2007-05-04]] | url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/common/printerfriendlystory.aspx?articleID=070428_238_A1_hVPma51656| title= Vice President Visits Tulsa: Cheney, Inhofe blast Democrats' plan for Iraq | first=Randy | last=Krehbiel | publisher= Tulsa World | accessdate=2007-05-06}}</ref>

A city councilor from each of the city's nine council districts is elected every two years, each serving a term of two years. Councilors are elected from their own respective districts based on a [[plurality voting system]], and serve on the Tulsa City Council. Roscoe Turner of District Three currently serves as the council chairman along with Vice Chairman John Eagleton of District Seven. As a whole, the council acts as the legislative body of city government, which aims to pass laws, approve the city budget, and manage efficiency in city government. In accordance with the mayor-council form of government, the Tulsa City Council and the office of the Mayor coordinate in city government operations. A third body of the government, the city auditor, is elected independently of the city council and mayor to ensure that the auditor can act in an objective manner. This position serves a term of two years, and the current city auditor is Phil Wood, a Democrat.<ref name="About the Tulsa City Council" /> The city serves as the [[county seat|seat of county government]] for Tulsa County, and lies mostly within [[Oklahoma's 1st congressional district]], with its far northwestern areas in southern Osage County in [[Oklahoma's 3rd congressional district]].

Municipal and State laws are enforced in Tulsa by the Tulsa Police Department, an organization of about 770 officers as of 2006.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.vachiefs.org/vacp/jobs/vacp_job_Tulsa.html | title=Police Chief <U+2013> Tulsa, OK| publisher=Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police| accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref> In 2004, Tulsa's crime rate was 7806.1 per 100,000 people, about 1.5 times the national average.<ref name="Crime stats">{{cite web | url=http://tulsa.areaconnect.com/crime1.htm| title=Tulsa OK Crime Statistics (2005 Crime Data) | publisher=Tulsa Area Connect| accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref> There were 58 murders, 1096 robberies, and 6,592 burglaries in 2004.<ref name="Crime stats" /> 

===Sister cities===

In accordance with the Tulsa Global Alliance, which operates in conjunction with [[Sister Cities International]], an organization that began under President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] in 1956, Tulsa has been given eight international [[town twinning|sister cities]] in an attempt to foster cross-cultural understanding:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tulsaglobalalliance.org/SisterCities.htm| title=Tulsa's Sister Cities| publisher=Tulsa Gobal Alliance| accessdate=2007-11-02}}</ref>

==Geography==

[[Image:Tulsa skyline.JPG|thumb|left|250px|The Tulsa skyline as viewed from Turkey Mountain]]
Tulsa is located in the northeastern corner of [[Oklahoma]], {{convert|99|mi|km}} northeast of [[Oklahoma City]]; situated between the edge of the [[Great Plains]] and the foot of the [[Ozark Mountains]] in a generally forested region of rolling hills. The city touches the eastern extent of the [[Cross Timbers]], an [[ecoregion]] of forest and [[prairie]] transitioning from the drier plains of the west to the wetter forests of the east.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.uark.edu/misc/xtimber/summary.html | publisher=[[University of Arkansas]]| title=The Ancient Cross Timbers| accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref> With a wetter climate than points westward, Tulsa serves as a gateway to "[[Green Country]]", a popular and official designation for northeast Oklahoma that stems from the region's green vegetation and relatively high amount of hills and lakes compared to central and western areas of Oklahoma,<ref>{{cite news | first=Leah | last=Clapman | title=Key Races: Oklahoma Senate | date=[[2004-09-24]] | publisher=PBS | url =http://www.pbs.org/newshour/vote2004/key-races/ok_profile.html | accessdate = 2007-04-30 }}</ref> which lie largely in the drier Great Plains region of the Central United States. Northeastern Oklahoma is the most topographically diverse part of the state, containing seven of Oklahoma's 11 ecoregions<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.travelok.com/atv/index.asp#map | publisher=Oklahoma Department of Tourism | title=Oklahoma, The All-Terrain Vacation | accessdate=2007-04-20 }}</ref> and more than half of its state parks.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.travelok.com/cities/regions.asp?region=G42.G4084 | publisher=Oklahoma Department of Tourism | title=Northeast Oklahoma's Green Country | accessdate=2007-04-30}}</ref> The region encompasses 30 lakes or reservoirs<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.greencountryok.com/browse.php?type=6| publisher=Green Country Marketing Association | title=Northeast Oklahoma Lakes | accessdate=2007-04-30 }}</ref> and borders the neighboring states of [[Kansas]], [[Missouri]], and [[Arkansas]]. The [[Geographic coordinate system|geographic coordinates]] of the city of Tulsa are {{coor dms|36|7|53|N|95|56|14|W|city}} (36.131294, -95.937332),{{GR|1}} with an elevation of 213&nbsp;meters (700&nbsp;ft) above [[sea level]].
[[Image:Tulsa satellite poster.jpg|thumb|right|As seen from space, most of Tulsa lies east of the Arkansas River.]]

===Topography===
