Jameson and Grdina formed [[Club Jenna]] as an [[Internet pornography]] company in 2000. ClubJenna.com was one of the first porn sites to provide more than pictures and videos; it provided explicit diaries, relationship advice, and even stock tips to paid members. The site was profitable in its third week.

The first ClubJenna film, ''Briana Loves Jenna'' (2001), co-produced with Vivid, cost [[United States dollar|US$]]280,000 to make, but grossed over $1 million in its first year.
