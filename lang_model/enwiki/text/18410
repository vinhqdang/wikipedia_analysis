'''California State Polytechnic University, Pomona''', or '''Cal Poly Pomona''', is a [[public university]] located in [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], [[California]], [[United States]]. It is one of [[Cal Poly|two polytechnics]] in the 23-member [[California State University]] system.

Cal Poly Pomona began as a satellite campus of the California Polytechnic School (today known as [[California Polytechnic State University|Cal Poly San Luis Obispo]]) in 1938 when a completely equipped school and farm in the city of [[San Dimas, California|San Dimas]] were donated by Charles Voorhis and his son [[Jerry Voorhis]]. The satellite campus grew further in 1949 when a [[Ranch|horse ranch]] in the neighboring city of Pomona, and who had belonged to [[Will Keith Kellogg]], were acquired. Cal Poly Pomona, then known as <U+201C>Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis Unit<U+201D>, and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo continued operations under a unified administrative control until they became independent from each other in 1966. 

Cal Poly Pomona currently offers multiple educational programs in [[California State Polytechnic University, Pomona academics|9 academic units]] and enrolls over 22,000 students as of fall 2010. The university is one among a small group of [[Institute of Technology (United States)#Polytechnic Universities|polytechnic universities in the United States]] which tend to be primarily devoted to the instruction of technical arts and applied sciences.

Once known strictly as a commuter school, in recent years Cal Poly Pomona has undertaken an effort to increase its academic standings while also evolving into a more traditional university. The university has raised admissions standards, increased on-campus student residences, built new facilities and expanded [[U.R. Bronco|its undergraduate research opportunities]]. Its sports teams are known as the [[Cal Poly Pomona Broncos]] and play in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division II (NCAA)|Division II]] as part of the [[California Collegiate Athletic Association]] (CCAA). The Broncos sponsor 10 varsity sports and have won 14 NCAA national championships.

In 1998, Cal Poly Pomona received criticism when it planned to grant an honorary degree to [[Robert Mugabe]]. Mugabe<U+2019>s negative humanitarian record as president of [[Zimbabwe]] lead protests from staff, faculty and students ultimately forcing the university to rescind the award.<ref>{{cite news | title= Cal Poly Pomona Chief Is Focus of Campus Contention | url= http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jun/15/local/me-60140| work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=2008-09-02 | first=Kenneth R. | last=Weiss | date=1998-06-15}}</ref>

Cal Poly Pomona underwent further growth in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, with the construction of the [[CLA Building]], academic facilities, expansion to the [[Cal Poly Pomona University Library]] and the addition of programs such as the [[Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies]], the [[International Polytechnic High School|I-Poly High School]] and the [[U.R. Bronco]] undergraduate research program. Under president [[J. Michael Ortiz]], Cal Poly Pomona launched its first comprehensive capital campaign in fall of 2008 to increase its permanent endowment.  Nevertheless, the negative economic effects caused by the [[late-2000s recession]] has increased student fees, reduced enrollment availability, eliminated two athletic programs and the introduced a mandatory [[furlough]] calendar for most of its 47,000 employees.<ref>{{cite web | title= CSU Trustees Vote to Raise 2010-11 Fees by 5 Percent | url= http://polycentric.csupomona.edu/news_stories/2010/06/csu-trustees-raise-fees-5percent.html| work= PolyCentric |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title= California State University Officials Outline Enrollment Cuts and Preview 2010-2011 Budget | url= http://www.calstate.edu/pa/news/2009/enrollment-budget.shtml| publisher= [[California State University]] |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title= Cal Poly Pomona Forced to Drop Men<U+2019>s and Women<U+2019>s Tennis | url= http://www.scta.usta.com/News/steve-2010/CalPoly/| publisher= [[United States Tennis Association]] |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title= Employee Furlough Information | url= http://www.csupomona.edu/~hr/furloughs.shtml| publisher= California State Polytechnic University, Pomona |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref> Cal Poly Pomona<U+2019>s financial endowment declined in value from $33.7 million in fiscal year 2007 to $27.6 million in 2009.<ref name="2007 NACUBO">{{cite web | title = All Institutions Listed by Fiscal Year 2008 Market Value of Endowment Assets with Percentage Change Between 2007 and 2008 Endowment Assets| work = 2008 NACUBO Endowment Study| publisher = National Association of College and University Business Officers | url = http://www.nacubo.org/documents/research/NES2008PublicTable-AllInstitutionsByFY08MarketValue.pdf| format = PDF | accessdate = 2010-09-11}}</ref><ref name="2009 NACUBO">As of June 30, 2009.{{cite web | title = U.S. and Canadian Institutions Listed by Fiscal Year 2009 Endowment Market Value and Percentage Change in Endowment Market Value from FY 2008 to FY 2009| work = 2009 NACUBO-Commonfund Study of Endowments | publisher = National Association of College and University Business Officers | url = http://www.nacubo.org/Documents/research/2009_NCSE_Public_Tables_Endowment_Market_Values.pdf| format = PDF | accessdate = 2010-09-11}}</ref>

At the north edge of the campus is the Voorhis Ecological Reserve, which serves as a [[wildlife corridor]] containing [[Coastal Sage Scrub]] and [[Quercus agrifolia|Coast Live Oak]] trees among others.  Contrasting some of these architecturally prominent facilities, there are various [[portable building]]s on campus which are used to accommodate the growing enrollment of recent decades. Cal Poly Pomona operates the [[International Polytechnic High School]], a college preparatory high school housed entirely in portable buildings which stand on what used to be a parking lot. As of June 2008, [[financial audit]]or [[KPMG]] valued Cal Poly Pomona's [[capital asset]]s at $307.9 million [[United States dollar|US Dollars]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.csupomona.edu/~fas/docs/0708_financial_statements.pdf|title= Financial Statements| date=2008-06-30| work=[[KPMG]]| publisher=California State Polytechnic University, Pomona| pages=6<U+2013>43| format=PDF| accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>

Cal Poly Pomona's dominant landmark is a [[futurist]]-style administrative facility known as the [[CLA Building]] which was designed by [[Antoine Predock]] and opened in 1993.

===Academic and research facilities===
The [[W. K. Kellogg Arabian Horse Center]] is an academic and research facility serving one of the 22 terms and conditions to the donation of the Kellogg ranch by maintaining Kellogg<U+2019>s purebred [[Arabian horse]]s and their breeding program. Another academic facility highlighting the Kellogg legacy is the Horse Stables (also known as University Plaza) which contains a small research library specializing in equine studies along with offices for student services and various campus organizations.

Conceived in 1995 by then university president, Bob H. Suzuki, and initially financed by [[NASA]] and the [[Economic Development Administration]], the Innovation Village is a {{convert|65|acre|m2|adj=on}} public/private partnership research and business facility at the southern edge of the campus. Major tenants include the [[American Red Cross]], [[Southern California Edison]], and the [[NASA]] Commercialization Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.innovationvillage.org/generalinfo.aspx|title=General Information|publisher= Innovation Village|accessdate= 2011-03-03}}</ref> The project is currently at the halfway mark of building and leasing {{convert|1000000|sqft|m2}} of the projected total building space. Once complete, it is estimated that the project would employ 2000 to 3000 people and provide half a billion dollars of economic benefits to the local, regional and state economies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.labusinessjournal.com/news/2005/dec/19/innovation-park-puts-cal-poly-pomona-on-biotech/|title=Innovation Park Puts Cal Poly Pomona on Biotech Map|work=[[Los Angeles Business Journal]]|accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref>

===Campus sustainability and transportation===
The university has actively sought to reduce carbon emissions and energy usage on campus. In November 2007, Cal Poly Pomona became a signatory member of the [[Campus Carbon Neutrality#American College and University Presidents' Climate Commitment|American College & University Presidents Climate Commitment]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://acupcc.aashe.org/ip/195/ |title= Implementation Profile for California State Polytechnic University-Pomona |month= July, 13 |year= 2009 |publisher= [[Campus Carbon Neutrality#The Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education|Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education]] |accessdate= 2010-08-22}}</ref> Among other things, this committed the university to ensure that within one year, it would purchase or produce at least 15% of the institution's electric consumption from [[Renewable resource|renewable sources]]. The university, along with other members in the CSU, is also a member of the [[California Climate Action Registry]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.climateregistry.org/about/members.html |title= Members |month= December, 15 |year= 2009 |publisher= [[California Climate Action Registry]] |accessdate= 2010-08-22}}</ref> and lists on ''[[The Princeton Review]]'s'' ''Guide to 286 Green Colleges''.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.princetonreview.com/green-schools-full-list.aspx |title= Members |year= 2010 |publisher= [[The Princeton Review]] |accessdate= 2010-08-22}}</ref>

Cal Poly Pomona's institute for sustainability education is the [[Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies]]. The center was built adjacent to an old landfill and conducts research in the areas of sustainable technology and agriculture. As an example of [[Cradle to Cradle Design]], it uses solar-powered dormitories, aquaculture ponds, and organic gardens while providing an environmentally-sustainable housing accommodation for 22 graduate students. The center is part of Agriscapes, a {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} research project that showcases environmental and agricultural sustainable practices including methods to grow food, conserve water and energy and recycle urban waste. Agriscapes is home of the Farm Store at Kellogg Ranch which sells locally and campus grown foods and products.  The Cal Poly Pomona campus also contains a rainforest greenhouse, a California [[ethnobotany]] garden, and an aquatic biology center collectively known as BioTrek, which provides environmental education to all academic levels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.csupomona.edu/~biotrek/|title=About BioTrek|publisher=California State Polytechnic University, Pomona|accessdate=2011-03-04}}</ref>

The entire campus community is served by a free campus shuttle system known as "Bronco Express". The shuttle system comprises 3 lines and is run by the office of Parking & Transportation Services (PTS).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsa.csupomona.edu/parking/maps.asp |title=Bronco Express Shuttle Map|publisher=Dsa.csupomona.edu |date=2009-09-24 |accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref> In addition, PTS also offers a shuttle service known as "BroncoLink" which provides both students and faculty a direct connection from the Pomona North and Downtown Pomona [[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]] stations to the [[CLA Building]].<ref name="Rideshare Home">{{cite web|url=http://www.dsa.csupomona.edu/parking/rideshare.asp?nfid=3863 |title=Rideshare Home |publisher=Dsa.csupomona.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref>

===Seismic risks and other challenges of campus development===
Although it's believed that the San Jose Fault runs through campus, and geotechnical investigations have been conducted, there is uncertainty regarding its precise [[Fault_(geology)#Fault_types|type]] and location. The CSU Seismic Review Board has classified several buildings on campus as some of the most seismically hazardous in the university system.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pazos|first=Celia S|coauthors=Potter, Hannah; and Polet, Jascha|title=Gravity Profiles across the San Jose Fault on Cal Poly Pomona campus|journal=Abstracts with Programs|publisher=[[Geological Society of America]]|volume=43|issue=2|pages=88|url=http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2011RM/finalprogram/abstract_187399.htm|accessdate=2011-04-09}}</ref> The CLA Building suffers from structural flaws, most notably, water intrusion. In 2005, the university filed a lawsuit against a contractor, for which it was compensated $13.3 million in an out-of-court [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archrecord.construction.com/news/daily/archives/2010/09/100927predock_cla_building.asp|title=Antoine Predock<U+2019>s CLA Building in California May Be Demolished|last=Hill|first=David|date=2010-09-27|work=[[Architectural Record]]|accessdate=2011-03-04}}</ref> Amid these concerns, on September 2010, the CSU Board of Trustees approved a proposal to have the building razed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://polycentric.csupomona.edu/news_stories/2010/09/csu-proposal-replace-cla.html|title=CSU Approves Proposal to Replace CLA|date=2010-09-22|work=polycentric|accessdate=2011-03-04}}</ref>

[[Hideo Sasaki]]'s architectural firm ''Sasaki Associates, Inc.'' found in the February 2010 [[Comprehensive planning|master plan]] that the campus's [[seismic risk]], uneven terrain, lack of parking spaces, small classrooms, and pedestrian-unfriendly roads are major constrains for future campus development. It also indicated the lack of identity, an undefined sense of arrival, and a desire to build a stronger on-campus community, among others, as recurrent themes among campus's users. Nonetheless, the firm highlights campus ethnic diversity, its location-climate, and the natural beauty of campus, among others, as positive aspects of the physical campus as well as the campus life experience.<ref>{{cite web| title=Cal Poly Pomona Campus Masterplan Forum| url=http://projects.sasaki.com/calpolypomona/Documents/CampusForumVision_002.pdf| format=PDF| work= Sasaki Associates, Inc.| publisher=California State Polytechnic University, Pomona| date=2010-02-11| pages=3<U+2013>6| accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref>

Cal Poly Pomona's academic offerings have evolved throughout the years. Prior to the ownership shift to Cal Poly SLO in 1938, the Voorhis School for Boys in San Dimas had been providing educational offerings in "music, bookkeeping, agriculture, library work, carpentry, nature study, machine shop, and printing" coupled with [[Christian]] religious fundamentals to an all-men student body comprising poor, underage boys.<ref name="Pflueger 1999 44"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Pflueger|1999|p=42.}}</ref> In 1938, the campus became the agricultural branch of Cal Poly SLO when a small staff was transfer from San Luis Obispo along with group of agricultural inspection students.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kennedy|2001|p=23.}}</ref> Thus, Cal Poly Pomona (then just Cal Poly) began offering [[Associate's degree]]s in 1938 and [[Bachelor's degree]]s in 1940 when, despite legislative opposition from pro-[[University of California]] members in [[Sacramento]], president Julian McPhee asked allied members Armistead B. Carter and Daniel C. Murphy to introduce the bill when two opposing members were not present to vote.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kennedy|2001|p=24.}}</ref> Following the governance breakup with the San Luis Obispo in 1966, and as outlined by the 1960 [[California Master Plan for Higher Education]], Cal Poly Pomona continued "offer[ing] undergraduate and graduate instruction through the master's degree in the liberal arts and sciences and professional education, including teacher education."<ref name="Master Plan">{{cite news | title=California State University mission | url=http://www.ucop.edu/acadinit/mastplan/csumission.htm| work= University of California <U+2014> Office of the President | accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> Currently, Cal Poly Pomona promotes a "learn by doing" philosophy, where an essential part of the curriculum is hands-on application of knowledge.<ref name="Cal Poly Pomona">{{cite news| title=University Vision and Identity Initiative| url=http://www.csupomona.edu/~alumni/docs/focus/meeting/University%20Vision%20and%20Identity%20Presentation.pdf| format=PDF| work= University Advancement Division at Cal Poly Pomona| page=7| accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref>

[[Merriam-Webster]] mentions that "polytechnic" is a word first used in 1801 derived from the [[French language|French]] ''[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/polytechnique polytechnique]'' which contains the [[Greek language|Greek]]-[[Root (linguistics)|roots]] "poly" (''[[English language|English]]:many'') and "techn<U+0113>" (''art''). Thus, Merriam-Webster defines "polytechnic" as, "relating to or devoted to instruction in many technical arts or applied sciences".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/polytechnic | title=Polytechnic - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary | work=[[Merriam-Webster]]| accessdate=2011-03-27}}</ref> Cal Poly Pomona's polytechnic approach, and learn-by-doing philosophy, encourages students in all programs to get real-world experience and skills necessary to join the workforce upon graduation.<ref name="Polytechnic Approach">{{cite web| title= Polytechnic Approach| url= http://www.dsa.csupomona.edu/visitors/files/polytechniclbd_153.pdf| format=PDF  publisher= Cal Poly Pomona| accessdate= 2008-08-19}}</ref>
