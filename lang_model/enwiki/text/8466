'''Henry III''' (1 October 1207&nbsp;<U+2013> 16 November 1272), also known as '''Henry of Winchester''', was [[King of England]], [[Lordship of Ireland|Lord of Ireland]] and [[Duke of Aquitaine]] from 1216 until his death.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|p=262}}</ref> The son of [[John, King of England|King John]] and [[Isabella of Angoul<U+00EA>me]], Henry assumed the throne when he was only nine in the middle of the [[First Barons' War]]. Cardinal [[Guala Bicchieri|Guala]] declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|William Marshal]], defeated the rebels at the battles of [[Battle of Lincoln (1217)|Lincoln]] and [[Battle of Sandwich (1217)|Sandwich]] in 1217. Henry promised to abide by the [[Magna Carta#The Great Charter 1225|Great Charter of 1225]], which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons. His early rule was dominated first by [[Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent|Hubert de Burgh]] and then [[Peter des Roches]], who reestablished royal authority after the war. In 1230 the King attempted to reconquer the [[John, King of England#Loss of Normandy, 1202<U+2013>04|provinces of France]] that had once belonged to his father, but the invasion was a debacle. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, [[Richard Marshal, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Richard]], broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by [[Christianity in England|the Church]].

Following the revolt, Henry ruled England personally, rather than governing through senior ministers. He travelled less than previous monarchs, investing heavily in a handful of his favourite [[Castles in Great Britain and Ireland#Palace-fortresses|palaces and castles]]. He married [[Eleanor of Provence]], with whom he had five children. Henry was known for his [[piety]], holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of [[Edward the Confessor]], whom he adopted as his [[patron saint]]. He extracted huge sums of money from the [[History of the Jews in England|Jews in England]], ultimately crippling their ability to do business, and as attitudes towards the Jews hardened, he introduced the [[Statute of Jewry]], attempting to segregate the community. In a fresh attempt to reclaim his family's lands in France, he invaded [[Poitou]] in 1242, leading to the disastrous [[Battle of Taillebourg]]. After this, Henry relied on diplomacy, cultivating an alliance with [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II]]. Henry supported his brother [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard]] in his bid to become [[King of the Romans]] in 1256, but was unable to place his own son [[Edmund Crouchback|Edmund]] on the throne of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], despite investing large amounts of money. He planned to go on [[crusade]] to the [[Levant]], but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in [[Gascony]].

By 1258, Henry's rule was increasingly unpopular, the result of the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his [[Poitiers|Poitevin]] half-brothers, the [[Lusignan dynasty|Lusignans]], as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'<U+00E9>tat and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the [[Provisions of Oxford]]. Henry and the baronial government enacted a [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|peace with France]] in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for [[Louis IX of France|King Louis IX of France]] recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued.

In 1263 one of the more radical barons, [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], seized power, resulting in the [[Second Barons' War]]. Henry successfully persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army. The [[Battle of Lewes]] occurred in 1264, where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner. Henry's eldest son, [[Edward I of England|Edward]], escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the [[Battle of Evesham]] the following year and freed his father. Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels, but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the [[Dictum of Kenilworth]]. Reconstruction was slow and Henry had to acquiesce to various measures, including further suppression of the Jews, to maintain baronial and popular support. Henry died in 1272, leaving Edward as his successor. He was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], which he had rebuilt in the second half of his reign, and was moved to his current tomb in 1290. Some [[miracle]]s were declared after his death but he was not [[Canonization|canonised]]. Henry's 56-year reign makes him the [[List of monarchs in Britain by length of reign|fifth longest reigning monarch]] in English history.<ref name=ODNB>{{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 | title=Henry III (1207<U+2013>1272) | website = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition| publication-date = September 2010 | year = 2004 | last = Ridgeway | first = Huw W. | accessdate=17 August 2013 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6Iak4PVrC | archivedate = 3 August 2013 | separator = , | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 | publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>

===Restoring royal authority===

The term "[[Parliament of England|parliament]]" first appeared in the 1230s and 1240s to describe large gatherings of the royal court, and parliamentary gatherings were held periodically throughout Henry's reign.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1996|pp=382<U+2013>383}}</ref> They were used to agree the raising of taxes which, in the 13th century, were single, one-off levies, typically on [[movable property]], intended to support the King's normal revenues for particular projects.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=355}}</ref>{{efn|In addition to taxes, the other main source of royal income were the royal manors, which produced revenue through a system called the county farms, traditionally collected through the local sheriffs.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=2<U+2013>3}}</ref> In 1236 this system was reformed, to avoid the risk of money being misappropriated by the sheriffs; revenues increased by roughly 10 percent, but were still inadequate to support Henry's policies in Europe.<ref name="Jobson 2012 3">{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=3}}</ref>}} During Henry's reign, the counties began to send regular delegations to these parliaments, and came to represent a broader cross-section of the community than simply the major barons.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1996|pp=390<U+2013>391}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=356}}</ref>

Despite the various charters, the provision of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs of immediate politics: sometimes action would be taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint, on other occasions the problem would simply be ignored.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1996|pp=26, 29, 37, 43}}</ref> The royal [[Eyre (legal term)|eyres]], courts which toured the country to provide justice at the local level, typically for those lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against the major lords, had little power, allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1996|p=105}}</ref> The power of royal sheriffs also declined during Henry's reign.

Henry had no further opportunities to reconquer his possessions in France after the collapse of his military campaign at Taillebourg.<ref name=ODNB/> Henry's resources were quite inadequate in comparison to those of the French Crown, and by the end of the 1240s it was clear that King Louis had become the preeminent power across France.<ref>{{harvnb|Aurell|2003|pp=30<U+2013>31}}; {{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|p=275}}</ref> Henry instead adopted what historian [[Michael Clanchy]] has described as a "European strategy", attempting to regain his lands in France through diplomacy rather than force, building alliances with other states prepared to put military pressure on the French King.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Clanchy|1998|p=220}}</ref> In particular, Henry cultivated Frederick II, hoping he would turn against Louis or allow his nobility to join Henry's campaigns.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|pp=104<U+2013>107}}</ref> In the process, Henry's attention became increasingly focused on European politics and events rather than domestic affairs.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|p=4}}</ref>

The disagreements between the leading barons involved in the revolt soon became evident.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=33}}</ref> De Montfort championed radical reforms that would place further limitations on the authority and power of the major barons as well as the Crown; others, such as Hugh Bigod, promoted only moderate change, while the conservative barons, such as de Clare, expressed concerns about the existing limitations on the King's powers.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=33<U+2013>34}}</ref> Henry's son, Edward, initially opposed the revolution, but then allied himself with de Montfort, helping him to pass the radical [[Provisions of Westminster]] in 1259, which introduced further limits on the major barons and local royal officials.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=26, 38<U+2013>43}}</ref>

===Crisis===
[[File:Louis9+Henri3+StDenis.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Painting of Henry and Louis IX|14th-century representation of Henry visiting Louis IX of France]]
Over the next four years, neither Henry nor the barons were able to restore stability in England, and power swung back and forth between the different factions.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=372<U+2013>377}}</ref> One of the priorities for the new regime, however, was to settle the long-running dispute with France and, at the end of 1259, Henry and Eleanor left for Paris to negotiate the final details of a [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|peace treaty]] with King Louis, escorted by Simon de Montfort and much of the baronial government.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=21, 45<U+2013>46}}</ref> Under the treaty, Henry gave up any claim to his family's lands in the north of France, but was confirmed as the legitimate ruler of Gascony and various neighbouring territories in the south, giving homage and recognising Louis as his feudal lord for these possessions.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=46}}</ref>

When de Montfort returned to England, Henry, supported by Eleanor, remained in Paris where he seized the opportunity to reassert royal authority and began to issue royal orders independently of the barons.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=47}}</ref> Henry finally returned to retake power in England in April 1260, where conflict was brewing between de Clare's forces and those of de Montfort and Edward.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=51<U+2013>52}}</ref> Henry's brother Richard mediated between the parties and averted a military confrontation; Edward was reconciled with his father and de Montfort was put on trial for his actions against the King.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=51<U+2013>53}}</ref> Henry was unable to maintain his grip on power, however, and in October a coalition headed by de Montfort, de Clare and Edward briefly seized back control, but within months their baronial council had collapsed into chaos as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=54<U+2013>56}}</ref>

Henry continued to publicly support the Provisions of Oxford, but he secretly opened discussions with [[Pope Urban IV]], hoping to be absolved from the oath he had made at Oxford.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=57<U+2013>59}}</ref> In June 1261, the King announced that Rome had released him from his promises and he promptly held a counter-coup with the support of Edward.<ref name=Jobson2012PP6164>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=61<U+2013>64, 66}}</ref> He purged the ranks of the sheriffs of his enemies and seized back control of many of the royal castles.<ref name=Jobson2012PP6164/> The baronial opposition, led by de Montfort and de Clare, were temporarily reunited in their opposition to Henry's actions, convening their own parliament, independent of the King, and establishing a rival system of local government across England.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=64<U+2013>67, 69}}</ref> Henry and Eleanor mobilised their own supporters and raised a foreign mercenary army.<ref name=Jobson2012PP70>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=70<U+2013>71}}</ref> Facing the threat of open civil war, the barons backed down: de Clare switched sides once again, de Montfort left for exile in France and the baronial resistance collapsed.<ref name=Jobson2012PP70/>

Henry's government relied primarily on Eleanor and her Savoyard supporters, and it proved short-lived.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=77}}</ref> He attempted to settle the crisis permanently by forcing the barons to agree to the [[Treaty of Kingston]].<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=73}}</ref> This treaty introduced a system of arbitration to settle outstanding disputes between the King and the barons, using Richard as an initial adjudicator, backed up by Louis of France should Richard fail to generate a compromise.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=73<U+2013>74}}</ref> Henry softened some of his policies in response to the concerns of the barons, but he soon began to target his political enemies and recommence his unpopular Sicilian policy.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=74<U+2013>76}}</ref> Henry's government was weakened by the death of de Clare, as his heir, Gilbert, sided with the radicals; the King's position was further undermined by major Welsh incursions along the Marches and the Pope's decision to reverse his judgement on the Provisions, this time confirming them as legitimate.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=79<U+2013>82}}</ref> By early 1263, Henry's authority had disintegrated and the country slipped back towards open civil war.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=84}}</ref>

De Montfort returned to England in April 1263 and convened a council of rebel barons in Oxford to pursue a renewed anti-Poitevin agenda.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=84<U+2013>85}}</ref> Revolt broke out shortly afterwards in the Welsh Marches and, by October, England faced a likely civil war between Henry, backed by Edward, Bigod and the conservative barons, and de Montfort, de Clare and the radicals.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=86<U+2013>89}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=374<U+2013>375}}</ref> De Montfort marched east with an army and London rose up in revolt.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=91<U+2013>92}}</ref> Henry and Eleanor were trapped in the Tower of London by the rebels; the Queen attempted to escape up the [[River Thames]] to join Edward's army at Windsor, but was forced to retreat by the London crowds.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=92<U+2013>93}}</ref> De Montfort took the pair prisoner, and although he maintained a fiction of ruling in Henry's name, the rebels completely replaced the royal government and household with their own, trusted men.<ref>{{harvnb|Wild|2011|pp=41<U+2013>42, 48}}</ref>

De Montfort's coalition began to quickly fragment, Henry regained his freedom of movement and renewed chaos spread across England.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=100}}</ref> Henry appealed to Louis of France for arbitration in the dispute, as had been laid out in the Treaty of Kingston; de Montfort was initially hostile to this idea, but, as war became more likely again, he decided to agree to French arbitration as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=100<U+2013>103}}</ref> Henry went to Paris in person, accompanied by de Montfort's representatives.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=103}}</ref> Initially de Montfort's legal arguments held sway, but in January 1264, Louis announced the [[Mise of Amiens]], condemning the rebels, upholding the King's rights and annulling the Provisions of Oxford.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=13<U+2013>105}}; {{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|p=283}}</ref> Louis had strong views of his own on the rights of kings over those of barons, but was also influenced by his wife, Margaret, who was Eleanor's sister, and by the Pope.<ref>{{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|p=283}}</ref>{{efn|The wording of Louis's judgement in the case also appears to suggest that the French King believed that he had feudal authority over Henry in his role as King of England, as a consequence of Henry having given homage to him for Gascony.<ref>{{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|p=337}}</ref>}} Leaving Eleanor in Paris to assemble mercenary reinforcements, Henry returned to England in February 1264, where violence was brewing in response to the unpopular French decision.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=107<U+2013>109}}; {{harvnb|Howell|2001|p= 208}}</ref>

The [[Second Barons' War]] finally broke out in April 1264, when Henry led an army into de Montfort's territories in the Midlands, and then advanced south-east to re-occupy the important route to France.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=109<U+2013>112}}</ref> Becoming desperate, de Montfort marched in pursuit of Henry and the two armies met at the [[Battle of Lewes]] on 14 May.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=113<U+2013>115}}</ref> Despite their numerical superiority, Henry's forces were overwhelmed.<ref name=Jobson2012PP115>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=115, 117}}</ref> His brother Richard was captured, and Henry and Edward retreated to the local priory and surrendered the following day.<ref name=Jobson2012PP115/> Henry was forced to pardon the rebel barons and reinstate the Provisions of Oxford, leaving him, as historian Adrian Jobson describes, "little more than a figurehead".<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=117, 122}}</ref>

De Montfort was unable to consolidate his victory and widespread disorder persisted across the country.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=119<U+2013>120}}</ref> In France, Eleanor made plans for an invasion of England with the support of Louis, while Edward escaped his captors in May and formed a new army.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=120<U+2013>121, 136<U+2013>137}}</ref> Edward pursued de Monfort's forces through the Marches, before striking east to attack his fortress at Kenilworth and then turning once more on the rebel leader himself.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=138<U+2013>141}}</ref> De Montfort, accompanied by the captive Henry, was unable to retreat and the [[Battle of Evesham]] ensued.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=140<U+2013>142, 144}}</ref> Edward was triumphant and de Montfort's corpse was mutilated by the victors; Henry, who was wearing borrowed armour, was almost killed by Edward's forces during the fighting before they recognised the King and escorted him to safety.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=140<U+2013>146}}</ref> In places the now leaderless rebellion dragged on, with some rebels gathering at Kenilworth, which Henry and Edward took after a long siege in 1266.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=149<U+2013>152, 154<U+2013>157}}</ref> The remaining pockets of resistance were mopped up, and the final rebels, holed up in the [[Isle of Ely]], surrendered in July 1267, marking the end of the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=381}}; {{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=155}}</ref>

The first histories of Henry's reign emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries, relying primarily on the accounts of medieval chroniclers, in particular writings of [[Roger of Wendover]] and [[Matthew Paris]].<ref name=ODNB/> These early historians, including Archbishop [[Matthew Parker]], were influenced by contemporary concerns about the roles of the Church and state, and examined the changing nature of kingship under Henry, the emergence of English nationalism during the period and what they perceived to be the malign influence of the Papacy.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 | title=Henry III (1207<U+2013>1272) | website = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition| publication-date = September 2010 | year = 2004 | last = Ridgeway | first = Huw W. | accessdate=17 August 2013 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6Iak4PVrC | archivedate = 3 August 2013 | separator = , | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/12950| publisher=Oxford University Press}}; {{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=261}}</ref> During the [[English Civil War]], historians also drew parallels between Henry's experiences and those of the deposed [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=261}}</ref>

Henry's reign did not receive much attention from historians for many years after the 1950s: no substantial biographies of Henry were written after Powicke's, and the historian John Beeler observed in the 1970s that the coverage of Henry's reign by military historians remained particularly thin.<ref>{{harvnb|Beeler|1972|p=50}}; {{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=12}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 | title=Henry III (1207<U+2013>1272) | website = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition| publication-date = September 2010 | year = 2004 | last = Ridgeway | first = Huw W. | accessdate=17 August 2013 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6Iak4PVrC | archivedate = 3 August 2013 | separator = , | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 | publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> At the end of the 20th century, however, there was a renewed interest in 13th-century English history, resulting in the publication of various specialist works on aspects of Henry's reign, including government finance and the period of Henry's minority.<ref name=ODNB/> Current historiography notes both Henry's positive and negative qualities: historian David Carpenter judges Henry to have been a decent man, who failed as a ruler due to his naivety and inability to produce realistic plans for reform, a theme echoed by Huw Ridgeway, who also notes his unworldliness and inability to manage his court, but who considers him to have been "essentially a man of peace, kind and merciful".<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=338<U+2013>340}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 | title=Henry III (1207<U+2013>1272) | website = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition| publication-date = September 2010 | year = 2004 | last = Ridgeway | first = Huw W. | accessdate=17 August 2013 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6Iak4PVrC | archivedate = 3 August 2013 | separator = , | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 | publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>

===Popular culture===
Henry's life was depicted in a series of contemporary illustrations sketched and water-coloured by the chronicler Matthew Paris, mostly drawn in the margins of the ''Chronica majora''.<ref>{{harvnb|Lewis|1987|pp=201<U+2013>207}}; {{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=105}}</ref> Paris first met Henry in 1236 and enjoyed an extended relationship with the King, although Paris disliked many of Henry's actions and the illustrations are frequently unflattering.<ref>{{harvnb|Lewis|1987|pp=201<U+2013>207}}</ref> Henry was also shown in the poetry of his Italian contemporary [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], who depicted Henry in the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' as an example of a negligent ruler, sitting alone in [[Purgatory]] to one side of the other failed kings.<ref name=Fritts2008P466>{{harvnb|Fritts|2008|p=466}}</ref> It is unclear why he is shown separately from his contemporaries; possible explanations include that this is a code by Dante to show that England was not part of the Holy Roman Empire, or that it is a favourable comment on Henry himself, highlighting his unusual piety.<ref name=Fritts2008P466/> Unlike many other medieval kings, Henry did not feature significantly in the works of [[William Shakespeare]], and in the modern period he has not been a prominent subject for films, theatre or television, having only a minimal role in modern popular culture.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|pp=11<U+2013>12}}</ref>
