{{Eras of the Halakha}}
'''Abbahu''' ('''{{lang-he|<U+05D0><U+05D1><U+05D4><U+05D5>}}''') was a [[Jew]]ish [[Talmud]]ist, known as an [[amora]], who lived in the [[Land of Israel]], of the 3rd amoraic generation (about 279-320), sometimes cited as R. Abbahu of [[Caesarea]] (<U+1E32>isrin).  His [[rabbinic]] education was acquired mainly at [[Tiberias]], in the academy presided over by [[R. Johanan]], with whom his relations were almost those of a son ([[Yer.]] [[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakhot]] ii.4b; [[Gittin]] 44b; [[Bava Batra]] 39a). He frequently made pilgrimages to Tiberias, even after he had become well known as rector of the Caesarean Academy (Yer. [[Shab]] viii.11a; Yer. [[Pesahim]] x.37c).

==Knowledge of Greek literature==
Abbahu was an authority on weights and measures ([[Yer.]] [[Terumot]] v.43c). He encouraged the study of [[Greek language|Greek]] by [[Jew]]s. He learned [[Greek language|Greek]] himself in order to become useful to his people and Shimon, then under the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ''[[proconsul]]s'', that language having become, to a considerable extent, the rival of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] even in prayer (Yer. [[Sotah]], vii.21b). In spite of the bitter protest of [[Simon b. Abba]], he also taught his daughters Greek (Yer. [[Shab.]] vi.7d; Yer. Sotah, ix.24c; [[San.]] 14a). Indeed, it was said of Abbahu that he was a living illustration of the maxim ([[Ecc.]] vii.18; compare [[Targum Onkelos|Targum]]), "It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this [the study of the Law]; yea, also from that [other branches of knowledge] withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all" ([[Ecc. R.]] to vii.18).

==Rector in Caesarea==
Being wise, handsome, and wealthy ([[Bava Metzia]] 84a; [[Yer.]] Bava Metzia iv.9d), Abbahu became not only popular with his coreligionists, but also influential with the proconsular government ([[Hagigah]] 14a; [[Ketubot]] 17a). On one occasion, when his senior colleagues, [[<U+1E24>iyya b. Abba]], [[Rav Ammi]], and [[Assi]], had punished a certain woman, and feared the wrath of the proconsul, Abbahu was deputed to intercede for them. He had, however, anticipated the rabbis' request, and wrote them that he had appeased the informers but not the accuser. The witty enigmatic letter describing this incident, preserved in the Talmud (Yer. [[Meg.]] iii.74a), is in the main pure [[Hebrew]], and even includes Hebrew translations of Greek proper names, to avoid the danger of possible exposure should the letter have fallen into the hands of enemies and informers (compare [[Eruvin]] 53b). 

After his ordination he declined a teacher's position, recommending in his stead a more needy friend, [[R. Abba of Acre]] (Acco), as worthier than himself ([[Sotah]], 40a). He thereby illustrated his own doctrine that it is a divine virtue to sympathize with a friend in his troubles as well as to partake of his joys ([[Tan.]], Wa-yesheb, ed. Buber, 16). Later he assumed the office of rector in C<U+00E6>sarea, the former seat of [[R. Hoshaya I]], and established himself at the so-called Kenishta Maradta (Insurrectionary Synagogue; Yer. [[Nazir (Talmud)|Nazir]] vii.56a; Yer. San.  i.18a; compare [[Josephus]], ''B. J.'' ii.14, <U+00A7> 5; [[Marcus Jastrow|Jastrow]], ''Dict.'' p.&nbsp;838), whence some of the most prominent teachers of the next generation issued. He did not, however, confine his activity to C<U+00E6>sarea, where he originated several ritualistic rules (Yer. [[Demai]] ii.23a, [[R.H.]] 34a), one of which<U+2014>that regulating the sounding of the shofar<U+2014>has since been universally adopted, and is referred to by medieval Jewish [[casuists]] as "Takkanat R. Abbahu" (the Enactment of R. Abbahu; compare "[[Ma<U+1E25>zor Vitry]]", Berlin, 1893, p.&nbsp;355). He also visited and taught in many other Jewish towns (Yer. [[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakhot]]  viii.12a; Yer. [[Shab.]] iii.5c).

While on these journeys, Abbahu gathered so many [[Halakot]] that scholars turned to him for information on mooted questions (Yer. Shabbat viii.11a; Yer. [[Yevamot]] i.2d). In the course of these travels he made a point of complying with all local enactments, even where such compliance laid him open to the charge of inconsistency (Yer. [[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakhot]]  viii.12a; Yer. [[Beitzah]], i.60d). On the other hand, where circumstances required it, he did not spare even the princes of his people (Yer. [[Avodah Zarah]], i.39b). Where, however, the rigorous exposition of laws worked hardship on the masses, he did not scruple to modify the decisions of his colleagues for the benefit of the community (Shabbat 134b; Yer. Shabbat xvii.16b; Yer. [[Mo'ed Katan]] i.80b). As for himself, he was very strict in the observance of the laws. On one occasion he ordered some [[Samaritan]] wine, but subsequently learning that there were no longer any strict observers of the dietary laws among the Samaritans, with the assistance of his colleagues, [[<U+1E24>iyya b. Abba]], [[Rav Ammi]], and [[Rav Assi]], he investigated the report, and, ascertaining it to be well founded, did not hesitate to declare the Samaritans, for all ritualistic purposes, [[Gentiles]] (Yer. Avodah Zarah, v. 44d; [[Hullin]] 6a).

==Abbahu and <U+1E24>iyya b. Abba==
R. Abbahu's chief characteristic seems to have been modesty. While lecturing in different towns, he met [[R. <U+1E24>iyya b. Abba]], who was lecturing on intricate [[halakic]] themes. As Abbahu delivered popular sermons, the masses naturally crowded to hear him, and deserted the halakist. At this apparent slight, R. <U+1E24>iyya manifested chagrin, and R. Abbahu hastened to comfort him by comparing himself to the pedler of glittering fineries that always attracted the eyes of the masses, while his rival was a trader in precious stones, the virtues and values of which were appreciated only by the connoisseur. This speech not having the desired effect, R. Abbahu showed special respect for his slighted colleague by following him for the remainder of that day. "What," said Abbahu, "is my modesty as compared with that of R. [[Abba of Acre]] (Acco), who does not even remonstrate with his interpreter for interpolating his own comments in the lecturer's expositions." When his wife reported to him that his interpreter's wife had boasted of her own husband's greatness, R. Abbahu simply said, "What difference does it make which of us is really the greater, so long as through both of us heaven is glorified?" ([[Sotah]], 40a). His principle of life he expressed in the maxim,

R. Abbahu, though eminent as a halakist, was more distinguished as a [[haggadist]] and controversialist. He had many interesting disputes with the [[Christians]] of his day ([[Shab.]] 152b; [[San.]]  39a; [[Av. Zarah]], 4a). Sometimes these disputes were of a jocular nature. Thus, a heretic bearing the name of Sason (=Joy) once remarked to him, "In the next world your people will have to draw water for me; for thus it is written in the [[Bible]] ([[Isaiah]] 12:3), 'With joy shall ye draw water.'" To this R. Abbahu replied, "Had the Bible said 'for joy' [le-sason], it would mean as thou sayest, but since it says 'with joy' [be-sason], it means that we shall make bottles of thy hide and fill them with water" ([[Suk.]] 48b). These controversies, though forced on him, provoked resentment, and it is even related that his physician, Jacob the Schismatic (Minaah), was slowly poisoning him, but [[R. Ammi]] and [[R. Assi]] discovered the crime in time ([[Av. Zarah]], 28a).

Abbahu had two sons, Zeira and <U+1E24>anina. Some writers ascribe to him a third son, Abimi (Bacher, ''Ag. Pal. Amor.''). Abbahu sent <U+1E24>anina to the academy at [[Tiberias]], where he himself had studied, but the lad occupied himself with the burial of the dead, and on hearing of this, the father sent him a reproachful message in this laconic style: "Is it because there are no graves in C<U+00E6>sarea (compare [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 14:11) that I have sent thee off to Tiberias? Study must precede practice" ([[Yer.]] [[Pesahim]]  iii.30b). Abbahu left behind him a number of disciples, the most prominent among whom were the leaders of the 4th amoraic generation, [[R. Jonah]] and [[R. Jose]]. At Abbahu's death the mourning was so great that it was said, "Even the statues of [[C<U+00E6>sarea]] shed tears" ([[Mo'ed Katan]] 25b; Yer. [[Av. Zarah]], iii.42c).

== Other Abbahus ==
There are several other Abbahus mentioned in the [[Talmud]]im and [[Midrashim]], prominent among whom is Abbahu (Abuha, Aibut) b. Ihi (Ittai), a [[Jews of Babylonia|Babylonian]] halakist, contemporary of Samuel and Anan ([[Eruvin]] 74a), and brother of Minyamin (Benjamin) b. Ihi. While this Abbahu repeatedly applied to Samuel for information, Samuel in return learned many Halakot from him ([[Naz.]] 24b; [[Bava Metzia]] 14a, 75a).

== Against the Christians ==
"When does your Messiah come?" a [[Christian]] (Minaah) once asked Abbahu in a tone of mockery, whereupon he replied: "When you will be wrapped in darkness, for it says, 'Behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the nations; then shall the Lord rise upon thee and His glory shall be seen on thee' [ [[Isaiah]] lx.2]," (Sanhedrin  99a). A Christian came to Abbahu with the quibbling question: "How could your God in His priestly holiness bury Moses without providing for purificatory rites, yet oceans are declared insufficient?" (Isaiah 40:12). "Why," said Abbahu, "does it not say, 'The Lord cometh with fire'?" (Isaiah 64:15). "Fire is the true element of purification, according to [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] xxi.23," was his answer (Sanhedrin  39a). Another question of the same character: "Why the boastful claim: 'What nation on earth is like Thy people Israel' (II [[Sam.]] 7:23), since we read, 'All the nations are as nothing before Him'?" (Isaiah 40:17), to which Abbahu replied: "Do we not read of Israel, he 'shall not be reckoned among the nations'?" (Numbers xxiii. 9, Sanhedrin  as above). 

Abbahu made a notable exception with reference to the [[Tosefta]]'s statement that the Gilionim (Evangels) and other books of the Mineans are not to be saved from a conflagration on [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]: "the books written by minnims for controversies may or  may not be saved" ([[Shab.]] 116a). Of special historical interest is the observation of Abbahu in regard to the benediction "Baruk Shem Kebod Malkuto" (Blessed be the Name of His glorious Kingdom) after the "Shema' Yisrael," that in Palestine, where the Christians look for points of controversy, the words should be recited aloud (lest the Jews be accused of tampering with the unity of God proclaimed in the Shema'), whereas in the Babylonian city of [[Nehardea]], where there are no Christians, the words are recited with a low voice ([[Pesahim]]  56a). Preaching directly against the Christian dogma, Abbahu says: "A king of flesh and blood may have a father, a brother, or a son to share in or dispute his sovereignty, but the Lord saith, 'I am the Lord thy God! I am the first; that is, I have no father, and I am the last; that is, I have no brother, and besides me there is no God; that is, I have no son'" ([[Isaiah]] 44:6; [[Ex. R.]] 29). His comment on Numbers 23:19 has a still more polemical tone: <U+201C>God is not a man that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent; <font face="times new roman" size=3>if a man says: <U+2018>I am a god<U+2019> he is a liar; if he says: <U+2018>I am a son of man<U+2019> he will have cause to regret it; and if he says, <U+2018>I will go up to heaven<U+2019> he has said [<i>something</i>] but will not keep his word<U+201D> [this last phrase is borrowed from <i>B'midbar</i> 23:19] ([[Yer.]] [[Ta'anit]], folio 9a, chapter II, <i>halachah</i> 1, end).</font>

Some of his controversies on Christian theological subjects, as on [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] ([[Yal<U+1E33>.]], Gen. 47), on [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] ([[Gen. R.]] 25), and on the resurrection ([[Shab.]] 152b), are less clear and direct (see Bacher, ''Ag. Pal. Amor.'' ii.97, 115-118).
