'''Portugal''', officially the '''Portuguese Republic'''<ref>{{en icon}} [http://www.portugal.gov.pt/Portal/EN/Portugal/ Portal do Governo], [[Portuguese Government]] official website</ref> ({{lang-pt|Rep<U+00FA>blica Portuguesa}}<ref>{{pt icon}} [http://www.portugal.gov.pt/Portal/PT/Portugal/ Portal do Governo], [[Portuguese Government]] official website</ref>; {{IPA2|<U+0281><U+025B><U+02C8>publik<U+0250> pu<U+027E>tu<U+02C8>gez<U+0250>}}), is a country in southwestern [[Europe]],<ref>United Nations [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm#europe Geographical region and composition]</ref> on the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Being the westernmost country of mainland Europe, Portugal is bordered by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west and south and by [[Spain]] to the north and east. The Atlantic [[archipelago]]s of the [[Azores Islands|Azores]] and [[Madeira]] are also part of Portugal. 

The land within the borders of today's Portuguese Republic has been continously settled since [[Prehistoric Iberia|prehistoric times]]. Some of the earliest [[civilization]]s include [[Lusitanians]] and [[Celt]]ic societies. Incorporation into the [[Roman Republic]] dominions took place in the 2nd century BC. The region was ruled and colonized by [[Germanic peoples]], such as the [[Suebi]] and the [[Visigoths]], from the 5th to the 8th century. The [[Muslim]] [[Moors]] arrived in the early 8th century and conquered the [[Christian]] [[Timeline of Portuguese history (Germanic Kingdoms)|Germanic kingdoms]], eventually occupying most of the Iberian Peninsula. In the early 1100s, during the Christian ''[[Reconquista]]'', Portugal appeared as a kingdom independent of its neighbour, the [[Kingdom of Le<U+00F3>n]] and [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]]. In a little over a century, in 1249, Portugal would establish almost its entire modern-day borders by conquering territory from the Moors.

During the 15th and 16th centuries, with a [[Portuguese Empire|global empire]] that included possessions in [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[South America]], Portugal was one of the world's major economic, political, and cultural powers. In the 17th century, the [[Portuguese Restoration War]] between Portugal and Spain ended the sixty year period of the [[Iberian Union]] (1580-1640). In the 19th century, armed conflict with French and Spanish invading forces and the loss of its largest territorial possession abroad, [[Brazil]], disrupted political stability and potential economic growth. After the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] and the [[Carnation Revolution]] [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]] in 1974, the ruling [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|regime]] was deposed in Lisbon and the country handed over its last overseas provinces in Africa. Portugal's last overseas territory, [[Macau]], was handed over to the [[People's Republic of China|P. R. China]] in 1999.

Portugal is a [[developed country]],<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/appendix/appendix-b.html Appendix B - International Organizations and Groups: developed countries (DCs)], CIA - The World Factbook - Appendix B, [[The World Factbook]]</ref> and although having one of the lowest [[GDP per capita]] of [[Western Europe]]an countries, it has a high [[Human Development Index]] and is among the world's 20 highest rated countries in terms of [[quality of life]].<ref>[http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/QUALITY_OF_LIFE.pdf Quality-of-life Survey], [[The Economist]]</ref> It is a member of the [[European Union]] (since 1986) and the [[United Nations]] (since 1955); as well as a founding member of [[OECD]], [[NATO]], [[CPLP]] (Comunidade dos Pa<U+00ED>ses de L<U+00ED>ngua Portuguesa <U+2014> Community of Portuguese Language Countries), and the European Union's [[Eurozone]].

==History==
<!-- If you want to expand this section, please add new info into the main article: "History of Portugal", your work there will be very appreciated. -->
{{Main|History of Portugal}}

The early history of Portugal, whose name derives from the Roman name [[Portus Cale]], is shared with the rest of the [[Iberian peninsula]]. The region was [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|settled]] by Pre-[[Celts]] and Celts, giving origin to peoples like the [[Lusitanians]], visited by [[Phoenicians]] and [[Carthaginians]], incorporated in the [[Roman Republic]] dominions (as [[Lusitania]] in 138 BC), settled again by [[Suevi]], [[Buri (Germanic tribe)|Buri]], and [[Visigoths]], and conquered by [[Moors]]. In 868, during the [[Reconquista]] (by which Christians reconquered the Iberian peninsula from the Muslim and Moorish domination), the [[First County of Portugal]] was formed. A victory over the Muslims at [[Ourique]] in 1139 is traditionally taken as the occasion when Portugal is transformed from a county into an [[Portuguese monarchy|independent kingdom]].

Portugal traces its national origin to [[June 24]] [[1128]] with the [[Battle of S<U+00E3>o Mamede]]. At the [[Battle of S<U+00E3>o Mamede]], [[Afonso I of Portugal|Afonso Henriques]], Count of Portugal, defeated his mother, [[Teresa, Countess of Portugal|Countess Teresa]], and her lover, [[Fern<U+00E3>o Peres de Trava]], in battle - thereby establishing himself as sole leader. Afonso Henriques proclaimed himself [[List of Portuguese monarchs|king of Portugal]] on [[July 25]], [[1139]], after the [[Battle of Ourique]] and was recognized as such in 1143 by [[Alfonso VII of Le<U+00F3>n|Afonso VII]], king of Le<U+00F3>n and Castile, and in 1179 by [[Pope Alexander III]]. 

Afonso Henriques and his successors, aided by military [[Christian monasticism|monastic orders]], pushed southward to drive out the Moors, as the size of Portugal covered about half of its present area. In 1249, this [[Reconquista]] ended with the capture of the [[Algarve]] on the southern coast, giving Portugal its present day borders, with minor exceptions.
[[Image:Castelo de Guimar<U+00E3>es (Portugal).jpg|thumb|left|The 10th century [[Castle of Guimar<U+00E3>es]], a national symbol, known as the "Cradle of Portugal", [[Guimar<U+00E3>es]]]]
In 1373, Portugal made an [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance|alliance with England]], which is the longest-standing alliance in the world.

In 1383, the king of Castile, husband of the daughter of the Portuguese king who had died without a male heir, claimed his throne. An ensuing popular revolt led to the [[1383-1385 Crisis]]. A faction of petty noblemen and commoners, led by John of Aviz (later [[John I of Portugal|John I]]), seconded by General [[Nuno <U+00C1>lvares Pereira]] defeated the Castilians in the [[Battle of Aljubarrota]]. This celebrated battle is still a symbol of glory and the struggle for independence from neighboring Spain.

In the following decades, Portugal spearheaded the exploration of the world and undertook the [[Portugal in the Age of Discovery|Age of Discovery]]. Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], son of King Jo<U+00E3>o I, became the main sponsor and patron of this endeavor.

In 1415, Portugal gained the first of its overseas colonies when a fleet conquered [[Ceuta]], a prosperous Islamic trade center in North [[Africa]]. There followed the first discoveries in the Atlantic: [[Madeira]] and the [[Azores]], which led to the first [[colonialism|colonization]] movements.

[[Image:Henry the Navigator.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Padr<U+00E3>o dos Descobrimentos]]'', a monument to [[Prince Henry the Navigator]] and the [[Portugal in the Age of Discovery|Portuguese Age of Discovery]], [[Lisbon]]]]
Throughout the 15th century, Portuguese explorers sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts for [[Economic history of Portugal#15th century|several common types of tradable commodities at the time, ranging from gold to slaves]], as they looked for a route to India and its spices, which were coveted in Europe. In 1498, [[Vasco da Gama]] finally reached India and brought economic prosperity to Portugal and its then population of one million residents.

In 1500, [[Pedro <U+00C1>lvares Cabral]], en route to India, discovered [[Brazil]] and claimed it for Portugal.<ref>The standard view of historians is that Cabral was blown off course as he was navigating the currents of the South Atlantic, sighted the coast of South America, thereby accidentally discovering Brazil.  For an account of an alternative view of the discovery of Brazil, however, see [[Alternative theory of the European discovery of Brazil]]</ref> Ten years later, [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] conquered [[Goa]], in [[India]], [[Ormuz]] in the Persian Strait, and [[Malacca]] in what is now a [[state]] in [[Malaysia]]. Thus, the Portuguese empire held dominion over commerce in the [[Indian Ocean]] and South Atlantic.  The Portuguese sailors set out to reach Eastern Asia by sailing eastward from Europe landing in such places like [[Taiwan]], [[Japan]], the island of [[Timor]], and it may also have been Portuguese sailors that were the first Europeans to discover [[Australia]].<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSSYD3449720070321 Map proves Portuguese discovered Australia: new book], in [[Reuters]] (Wed Mar 21, 2007) - (see [[Theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia]])</ref>

Portugal's independence was interrupted between 1580 and 1640. Because the heirless King [[Sebasti<U+00E3>o of Portugal|Sebastian]] died in battle in Morocco, [[Philip II of Spain]] claimed his throne and so became Philip I of Portugal. Although Portugal did not lose its formal independence, it was governed by the same monarch who governed [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], briefly forming a [[Iberian Union|union]] of kingdoms, as a [[personal union]]; in 1640, [[John IV of Portugal|John IV]] spearheaded an uprising backed by disgruntled nobles and was proclaimed king. The [[Portuguese Restoration War]] between Portugal and Spain on the aftermath of the 1640 revolt, ended the sixty-year period of the [[Iberian Union]] under the [[House of Habsburg]]. This was the beginning of the [[House of Braganza]], which was to reign in Portugal until 1910. On [[1 November]] [[1755]], [[Lisbon]], the largest city and capital of the Portuguese Empire, was strongly shaken by [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|an earthquake]] which killed between 60,000 and 90,000 people and destroyed eighty-five percent of the city.

By this time, however, the [[Portuguese empire]] was already under attack from other countries, specifically Britain and the Netherlands. Portugal began a slow but inexorable decline until the 20th century. This decline was hastened by the independence in 1822 of the country's largest colonial possession, [[Brazil]].
[[Image:Portuguese colonial war map1.PNG|thumb|left|upright|Map of the Portuguese Overseas provinces in Africa by the time of the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961-1974)]]
At the height of European [[colonialism]] in the 19th century, Portugal had lost its territory in [[South America]] and all but a few bases in Asia. During this phase, Portuguese colonialism focused on expanding its outposts in Africa into nation-sized territories to compete with other European powers there. Portuguese territories eventually included the modern nations of [[Cape Verde]], [[S<U+00E3>o Tom<U+00E9> and Pr<U+00ED>ncipe]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Angola]], and [[Mozambique]].

In 1910, a revolution deposed the [[Portuguese monarchs|Portuguese monarchy]], but chaos continued and considerable economic problems were aggravated by the [[Portugal in the Great War|military intervention in the First World War]], which led to a [[28 May 1926 coup d'<U+00E9>tat|military coup d'<U+00E9>tat in 1926]]. This in turn led to the establishment of a right-wing dictatorship by [[Ant<U+00F3>nio de Oliveira Salazar]].

In December 1961, the Portuguese army was involved in armed action in its colony of [[Portuguese India]] against an [[Operation Vijay (1961)|Indian invasion]]. The operations resulted in the defeat of the isolated and relatively small Portuguese defense force which was not able to resist a much larger enemy. The outcome was the loss of the Portuguese territories in the [[Indian subcontinent]].

Also in the early 1960s, independence movements in the Portuguese overseas provinces of [[Angola]], [[Mozambique]], and [[Portuguese Guinea]], in Africa, resulted in the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961-1974). In 1974, a bloodless left-wing military [[coup]] in [[Lisbon]], known as the [[Carnation Revolution]], led the way for a modern democracy as well as the independence of the last colonies in Africa shortly after. However, Portugal's last overseas territory, [[Macau]] (Asia), was handed over to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1999.

Portugal was a founding member of [[NATO]], [[OECD]] and [[EFTA]]. In 1986, Portugal joined the [[European Union]] (then the [[European Economic Community]]). It is also a co-founder of the [[CPLP]].

==Government and politics==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
[[Image:Assembleia Republica Portugal 3.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Assembly of the Republic]], [[Lisbon]]]]
{{main|Politics of Portugal}}
Portugal is a democratic republic ruled by the [[Portuguese Constitution of 1976|constitution of 1976]] with [[Lisbon]], the nation's largest city, as its capital. 
The four main governing components are the [[List of Presidents of Portugal|president of the republic]], the [[assembly of the republic]], the [[Government of Portugal|government]], and the courts. The constitution grants the division or separation of powers among legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Portugal like most European countries has no [[state religion]], making it a [[secular state]].

The president, who is elected to a five-year term, has a supervising, nonexecutive role. The current President is [[An<U+00ED>bal Cavaco Silva]]. The Assembly of the Republic is a [[unicameral]] parliament composed of 230 deputies elected for four-year terms.

The government is headed by the [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|prime minister]] (currently [[Jos<U+00E9> S<U+00F3>crates]]), who chooses the Council of Ministers, comprising all the ministers and the respective state secretaries. The national and regional governments, and the [[Assembly of the Republic|Portuguese parliament]], are dominated by two political parties, the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]]. Minority parties [[Unitarian Democratic Coalition|CDU]] ([[Portuguese Communist Party]] plus [[Ecologist Party "The Greens"]]), [[Left Bloc|Bloco de Esquerda]] (Left Bloc) and [[Democratic and Social Center / People's Party|CDS-PP]] (People's Party) are also represented in the [[Assembly of the Republic|parliament]] and local governments.

The [[courts]] are organized into categories, including judicial, administrative, and fiscal. The [[Portuguese Supreme Court|supreme court]]s are the courts of last appeal. A thirteen-member [[Portuguese Constitutional Court|constitutional court]] oversees the constitutionality of legislation.

==Foreign relations==
<!-- If you want to expand this section, please add new info into the main articles: "Foreign Relations of Portugal" and "Military of Portugal", your work there will be very appreciated. -->
{{main|Foreign relations of Portugal}}

Portugal is a founding member of [[NATO]] (1949), [[OECD]] and [[EFTA]]; it left the latter in 1986 to join the [[European Union]]. In 1996 it co-founded the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]]. It has a friendship alliance and [[multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] treaty with Brazil. Portugal is part of  the world's oldest active alliance through its [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance|treaty with the United Kingdom]].

The only international dispute concerns the municipality of [[Olivenza|Oliven<U+00E7>a]]. Under Portuguese sovereignty since 1297, the municipality of Oliven<U+00E7>a was ceded to Spain under the Treaty of Badajoz in 1801, after the [[War of the Oranges]]. Portugal claimed it back in 1815 under the [[Congress of Vienna|Treaty of Vienna]]. Nevertheless, bilateral diplomatic relations between the two neighbouring countries are cordial, as well as within the [[European Union]].

==Military of Portugal==
{{main|Military of Portugal|Military history of Portugal}}
The armed forces have three branches: [[Portuguese Army|Army]], [[Portuguese Navy|Navy]], and [[Portuguese Air Force|Air Force]]. The military of Portugal serves primarily as a self-defense force whose mission is to protect the territorial integrity of the country and providing humanitarian assistance and security at home and abroad. Since the early 2000s, compulsory military service is no longer practised. The changes also turned the forces' focus towards professional military engagements. The age for voluntary recruitment is set at 18.  In the 20th century, Portugal engaged in two major military interventions: the [[Portugal in the Great War|First Great War]] and the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961-1974). Portugal has participated in peacekeeping missions in [[East Timor]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Kosovo]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]] ([[Nasiriyah]]), and [[Lebanon]].

[[Image:Portugal NUTS II.svg|thumb|right|Map of [[Mainland Portugal]] and the two [[autonomous regions of Portugal]] (not in their actual locations)]]
{{main|Administrative divisions of Portugal}}
Portugal has an administrative structure of 308 [[municipalities of Portugal|municipalities]] (Portuguese singular/plural: ''concelho/concelhos''), which are subdivided into more than 4,000 [[freguesia|parishes]] (''freguesia/freguesias''). Municipalities are grouped for administrative purposes into superior units. For continental Portugal the municipalities are gathered in 18 Districts, while the Islands have a Regional Government directly above them. Thus, the largest unit of classification is the one established since 1976 into either [[mainland Portugal]] (''Portugal Continental'') or the [[autonomous regions of Portugal]] ([[Azores]] and [[Madeira]]).

The [[European Union]]'s system of [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics]] is also used. According to this system, Portugal is divided into 7 regions ([[Alentejo]], [[Algarve]], [[A<U+00E7>ores]], [[Centro, Portugal|Centro]], [[Lisboa, Region|Lisboa]], [[Madeira]], and [[Norte, Portugal|Norte]]), which are subdivided into 30 subregions.

==Geography and climate==

[[Image:Burgau, Algarve, Portugal.jpg|thumb|left|[[Burgau, Portugal|Burgau]], [[Algarve]] - a view of the Southwest Alentejo and Cape St. Vicente Coast Natural Park.]]
{{main|Geography of Portugal|Conservation areas of Portugal}}

The climate can be classified as [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] type ''csa'' in the south and ''csb'' in the north, according to the [[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]]. Portugal is one of the warmest European countries, the annual temperature averages in [[mainland Portugal]] are 13 <U+00B0>C (55 <U+00B0>F) in the north and 18 <U+00B0>C (64 <U+00B0>F) in the south. The [[Madeira]] and [[Azores]] Atlantic archipelagos have a narrower temperature range. Generally, spring and summer are sunny, whereas autumn and winter are rainy and windy. 
Extreme temperatures occur in Northeastern parts of the country in winter (where they may fall to -15 <U+00B0>C) and Southeastern parts in summer (where they can soar up to 45 <U+00B0>C). Sea coastal areas are milder, temperatures varying between -2 <U+00B0>C in the coldest winter mornings and 37 <U+00B0>C in the hottest summer afternoons. Absolute extremes registered so far have been -23 <U+00B0>C in [[Serra da Estrela]] and 48 <U+00B0>C in the [[Alentejo]] region. 
[[Image:Serra da Estrela II Portugal.jpg|thumb|[[Serra da Estrela]] during the winter season]]
[[Continental Portugal|Mainland Portugal]] is split by its main river, the [[Tagus]]. The northern landscape is mountainous in the interior areas, with plateaus indented by river valleys. The south, between the [[Tagus]] and the [[Algarve]] (the [[Alentejo]]), features mostly rolling plains and a climate somewhat warmer and drier than in the cooler and rainier north. The [[Algarve]], separated from the [[Alentejo]] by mountains, enjoys a [[Mediterranean climate]] much like southern Spain. [[Snow]] falls occasionally (on some cold winter days) in the northern interior of the country, from October to May. However, it is a very rare event in the south. The coast registers snow usually once in five or six years.
[[Image:Alentejo oak on wheat field.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alentejo]] - Cork Oak on wheat field, a typical image of the Alentejo region, Portugal]]

The islands of the Azores are located in the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] whilst the Madeira islands were formed by the activity of an [[plate tectonics|in-plate]] [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]], much like the [[Hawaii|Hawaiian archipelago]]. Some islands have had volcanic activity as recently as 1957. Portugal's highest point is [[Mount Pico]] on [[Pico Island]]. It is an ancient volcano measuring 2,351 m (7,713 ft). 
[[Continental Portugal|Mainland Portugal]]'s highest point is [[Serra da Estrela]], measuring 1993 m (6,558 ft).

[[Portugal EEZ|Portugal's Exclusive Economic Zone]], a seazone over which the Portuguese have special rights over the exploration and use of marine resources, has 1,727,408 km<U+00B2>. This is the 3rd largest [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] of the [[European Union]] and the 11th in the world.

[[Conservation areas of Portugal]] include one national park (Parque Nacional), 12 natural parks (Parque Natural), 9 natural reserves (Reserva Natural), 5 natural monuments (Monumento Natural), and 7 protected landscapes (Paisagem Protegida), ranging from the [[Parque Nacional da Peneda-Ger<U+00EA>s]] to the [[Parque Natural da Serra da Estrela]] to the [[Paul de Arzila]].

{{main|Economy of Portugal|Economic history of Portugal}}

Portugal's economy is based on industries such as textiles, clothing, footwear, cork and wood products, beverages (wine), porcelain and earthenware, and glass and glassware. In addition, the country has increased its role in Europe's automotive sector and has a world-class mold-making industry. Services, particularly tourism, are playing an increasingly important role. Portugal's [[European Union]] (EU) funding will be cut by 10%, to 22.5 billion euros, during the 2007-2013 period. EU expansion into eastern Europe has erased Portugal's historic competitive advantage and relative low labor costs. The governments are working to change Portugal's [[economic development]] model from one based on [[consumption|public consumption]] and [[public investment]] to one focused on [[exports]], [[investment|private investment]], and development of the [[high-tech]] sector.

Portugal joined the [[European Union]] in 1986 and started a process of modernization within the framework of a stable environment. It has achieved a healthy level of growth. Successive governments have implemented reforms and privatized many state-controlled firms and liberalized key areas of the economy. Portugal was one of the founding countries of the [[euro]] in 1999, and therefore is integrated into the [[Eurozone]].

Major industries include [[oil refineries]], [[automotive]], [[cement]] production, [[pulp and paper industry]], [[textile]], [[footwear]], [[furniture]], and [[cork (material)|cork]] (of which Portugal is the world's leading producer).<ref>''Grande Enciclop<U+00E9>dia Universal'', p. 10543, "Portugal", para. 4</ref> Manufacturing accounts for 33% of exports. Portugal is the world's fifth-largest producer of [[tungsten]], and the world's eighth-largest producer of [[wine]]. Agriculture and Fishing (see [[Portugal EEZ]]) no longer represents the bulk of the economy, but [[Portuguese wines]], namely [[Port Wine]] (named after the country's second largest city, [[Porto]]) and [[Madeira Wine]] (named after [[Madeira|Madeira Island]]), are exported worldwide. [[Tourism]] is also important, especially in mainland Portugal's southernmost region of the [[Algarve]] and in the Atlantic [[Madeira|Madeira archipelago]]. [[Image:Funchal Pico da Cruz.jpg|thumb|[[Funchal]], [[Madeira]] - tourism is an important economic activity in the Portuguese island of Madeira.]]

The Global Competitiveness Report for 2005, published by the [[World Economic Forum]], places Portugal on the 22nd position, ahead of countries such as [[Spain]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[France]], [[Belgium]] and [[Hong Kong]] <!-- Portugal fall behind these countries in more recent Competitve Report so might need to update -->. This represents an increase of two places from the 2004 ranking. Portugal was ranked 20th on the Technology index and 15th on the Public Institutions index.<ref>[http://www.investinportugal.pt/MCMSAPI/HomePage/NewsRoom/PORTUGAL+IMPROVES+ITS+POSITION+IN+THE+WEF+COMPETITIVENESS+RANKING.htm http://www.investinportugal.pt/MCMSAPI/HomePage/NewsRoom/PORTUGAL+IMPROVES+ITS+POSITION+IN+THE+WEF+COMPETITIVENESS+RANKING.htm] ''Investinportugal.pt'' Retrieved on 05-16-07 </ref>

Research about [[standard of living]] by the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]'s [[quality of life]] survey<ref>http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/QUALITY_OF_LIFE.pdf</ref> places Portugal as the country with the 19th-best quality of life in the world, ahead of other economically and technologically advanced countries like [[France]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[South Korea]]. This is despite the fact that Portugal has the lowest per capita GDP in Western Europe (though still very high by global standards). 

[[Caixa Geral de Dep<U+00F3>sitos]], [[Energias de Portugal|EDP]], [[Galp Energia|Galp]], [[Millennium bcp]], [[Portugal Telecom]] and [[Sonae]] are among the largest corporations of Portugal by both number of employees and [[net income]].

The major [[stock exchange]] is the [[Euronext Lisbon]] which is part of the [[NYSE Euronext]], the first global stock exchange. The [[PSI-20]] is Portugal's most selective and widely known [[stock index]].

{{main|Transportation in Portugal|Communications in Portugal|Renewable energy in Portugal|Water supply and sanitation in Portugal}}

In 2006 the world's largest [[solar energy|solar power]] plant began operating in the nation's sunny south while the world's first commercial [[wave power]] farm opened in October 2006 in the [[Norte region]]. As of 2006, 55% of electricity production was from coal and fuel power plants. The other 40% was produced by [[hydroelectric]]s and 5% by [[wind energy]]. The government is channeling $3.8 billion into developing [[renewable energy]] sources over the next five years.

Portugal wants [[renewable energy]] sources like solar, wind and wave power to account for nearly half of the electricity consumed in the country by 2010. "This new goal will place Portugal in the frontline of renewable energy and make it, along with [[Austria]] and [[Sweden]], one of the three nations that most invest in this sector", Prime Minister [[Jos<U+00E9> S<U+00F3>crates]] said.
[[Image:Alqueva3.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alqueva Dam]], [[Alentejo]] - [[irrigation]] and [[hydroelectric power]] generation facility which created the largest artificial lake in Western Europe]]
Transportation was seen as a priority in the 1990s, pushed by the growing use of automobiles and industrialization. The country has a 68,732 km (42,708 mi) network of roads, of which almost 3,000 km (1,864 mi) are part of a 44 [[motorway]]s system.

The two principal metropolitan areas have subway systems: [[Lisbon Metro]] and Metro Sul do Tejo in Lisbon [[Metropolitan Area]] and [[Porto Metro]] in Porto, each with more than 35 km (22&nbsp;mi) of lines. Construction of a high-speed [[TGV]] line connecting Porto with Lisbon and Lisbon with Madrid will begin in 2008; it will replace the [[Pendolino]]s.

Lisbon's geographical position makes it a stopover point for many foreign airlines at airports all over the country. The government is currently studying two locations ([[Ota Airport|Ota]] and Alcochete) to replace the present Lisbon airport. Currently, the most important airports are in [[Portela Airport|Lisbon]], [[Faro Airport (Portugal)|Faro]], [[Francisco S<U+00E1> Carneiro Airport|Porto]], [[Madeira Airport|Funchal]] ([[Madeira]]), and [[Jo<U+00E3>o Paulo II Airport|Ponta Delgada]] ([[Azores]]).
[[Image:A28 No da Povoa de Varzim.JPG|thumb|right|[[A28 (Portugal)|A28]] motorway, [[Norte, Portugal|Norte]] - Portugal has a developed [[motorway]] system.]]
Portugal has one of the highest [[mobile phone]] penetration rates in the [[world]] (the number of operative mobile phones already exceeds the population). This network also provides wireless mobile Internet connections as well, and covers the entire territory. As of October 2006, 36.8% of households had high-speed Internet services and 78% of companies had Internet access. Most Portuguese watch television through cable (June 2004: 73.6% of households). Paid Internet connections are available at many caf<U+00E9>s, as well as many post offices. One can also surf on the Internet at hotels, conference centres and shopping centres, where special areas are reserved for this purpose. Free internet access is also available to Portuguese residents at "Espa<U+00E7>os de Internet" across the country.

Portugal has also modernized its [[Water supply and sanitation in Portugal|water supply and sanitation system]], in particular by increasing the rate of wastewater treated with support from EU subsidies to 80%. The country has also established a modern institutional and legal framework for the water and sanitation sector, including an autonomous regulatory agency, a national asset holding company called Aguas de Portugal and a number of multi-municipal utilities. This replaced an institutionally fragemented sector structure, under which the country's 308 municipalities - many of them very small - had exclusive responsibility for water and sanitation.

{{main|Demographics of Portugal}}
[[Image:Porto Ribeira.jpg|thumb|[[Douro]] river crossing ''[[Grande Porto]]'', Portugal's second most populated subregion]]

The country is fairly homogeneous linguistically and religiously. Native [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] are ethnically a combination of pre-Celts and [[Celts]] along with some other minor contributions by [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] ([[Visigoths]], [[Suebi]], [[Buri (Germanic tribe)|Buri]]), some [[Jew]]s and [[Moors]] (mostly [[Berber people|Berber]]s and some [[Arab]]s). 

In the 2001 census, the population was 10,356,117, of which 51% was female, 48% was male. Portugal, long a country of emigration, has now become a country of net immigration,<ref>Charis Dunn-Chan ,[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4436276.stm Portugal sees integration progress], [[BBC]]</ref> and not just from the former [[Republic of India|India]]n and [[Africa]]n [[Portuguese empire|colonies]]; by the end of 2003, legal [[immigrants]] represented about 5% of the population, and the largest communities were from [[Brazil]], [[Ukraine]], [[Romania]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Angola]], [[Russia]], [[Guinea-Bissau]] and [[Moldova]] with other immigrants from parts of [[Latin America]], [[Han Chinese|China]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. The great majority of Portuguese are [[Catholic Church in Portugal|Roman Catholic]], though a large percentage consider themselves non-practicing, especially in urban areas. The biggest metropolitan areas are [[Lisbon]], [[Porto]], [[Braga]], [[Coimbra]], [[Set<U+00FA>bal]] and [[Aveiro]].

==Education, science and technology==
<!-- If you want to expand this section, please add new info into the main articles: "Education in Portugal" and "Higher education in Portugal", your work there will be very appreciated. -->
[[Image:Coimbra University Tower 2.jpg|thumb|right|The tower of the [[University of Coimbra]], [[Coimbra]]]]
{{main|Education in Portugal|Higher education in Portugal|Science and technology in Portugal}}
The educational system is divided into preschool (for those under age 6), basic education (9 years, in three stages, [[compulsory]]), [[secondary education]] (3 years), and [[higher education]] ([[university]] and [[polytechnic]]). 

Portuguese universities have existed since 1290. The [[University of Coimbra|oldest Portuguese university]] was first established in [[Lisbon]] before moving to [[Coimbra]]. Universities are usually organized into [[faculty (university)|faculties]]. Institutes and schools are also common designations for autonomous subdivisions of [[list of colleges and universities in Portugal|Portuguese higher education institutions]], and are always used in the polytechnical system. The [[Bologna process]] has been adopted since 2006 by Portuguese universities and polytechnical institutes.

Scientific and technological [[research]] activities in Portugal are mainly conducted within a network of [[R&D]] units belonging to [[list of universities in Portugal|public universities]] and state-managed autonomous research institutions like the [[Instituto Nacional de Engenharia, Tecnologia e Inova<U+00E7><U+00E3>o|INETI - Instituto Nacional de Engenharia, Tecnologia e Inova<U+00E7><U+00E3>o]]. The funding of this research system is mainly conducted under the authority of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education. The largest R&D units of the public universities by number of publications which achieved significant international recognition, include [[biosciences]] research institutions like the [[Instituto de Medicina Molecular]], the [[Centre for Neuroscience and Cell Biology]], the [[IPATIMUP]] and the [[Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular]], among others. Internationally notable state-supported research centres in other fields include the [[International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory<U+200E>]], a joint research effort between Portugal and Spain. Among the largest non-state-run research institutions in Portugal are the [[Instituto Gulbenkian de Ci<U+00EA>ncia]] and the [[Champalimaud Foundation]] which yearly awards one of the highest monetary prizes of any science prize in the world. A number of both national and multinational high-tech and industrial companies, are also responsible for research and development projects. 

Portugal have entered into [[Higher education in Portugal#International partnership agreements|cooperation agreements with MIT (USA) and other North American institutions]] in order to further develop and increase the effectiveness of Portuguese higher education.

==Law==
<!-- If you want to expand this section, please add new info into the main article: "Portuguese Legal System", your work there will be very appreciated. -->
{{main|Law of Portugal|Portuguese legal system}}
The [[Portuguese legal system]] is part of the civil law legal system, also called the continental family legal system. Until the end of the 19th century, [[France|French]] law was the main influence. Since then the major influence has been [[German legal system|German law]]. The main laws include the [[Constitution]] (1976, as amended), the [[Civil Code]] (1966, as amended) and the [[Penal Code]] (1982, as amended). Other relevant laws are the ''Commercial Code'' (1888, as amended) and the ''Civil Procedure Code'' (1961, as amended). Portuguese law applied in the former [[Portuguese colonies|colonies and territories]] and continues to be the major influence for those countries.

==Religion==

[[Image:Mosteiro dos Jeronimos - Igreja 2.jpg|thumb|[[Jer<U+00F3>nimos Monastery]], [[Lisbon]]|upright]]
{{main|Religion in Portugal}}
Portuguese society is overwhelmingly [[Roman Catholic]]. 84% of the population are nominally Roman Catholic, but only about 19% attend mass and take the sacraments regularly. A larger number wish to be baptized, married in the church, and receive last rites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ateismo.net/diario/2007/01/portugal-est-mais-secularizado-do-que.php|title=Portugal est<U+00E1> mais secularizado do que a Espanha|accessdate=2007-04-28|publisher=Di<U+00E1>rio Ate<U+00ED>sta|date=[[18 January]] [[2007]]}}</ref>

Many Portuguese holidays, festivals and traditions have a [[Christianity|Christian]] origin or connotation.  Although relations between the Portuguese state and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] were generally amiable and stable since the earliest years of the Portuguese nation, their relative power fluctuated. In the [[History of Portugal (1279-1415)|13th and 14th centuries]], the church enjoyed both riches and power stemming from its role in the [[reconquista|reconquest]] and its close identification with early Portuguese nationalism and the foundation of the Portuguese educational system, including the [[University of Coimbra|first university]]. The growth of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese overseas empire]] made its [[Mission (Christian)|missionaries]] important agents of [[Colonisation|colonization]] with important roles of [[evangelization]] and [[teaching]] in all inhabited continents.

==Culture==

{{main|Culture of Portugal}}
[[Image:Roman temple, Evora, Alentejo, Portugal, 28 September 2005.jpg|thumb|Roman temple, [[<U+00C9>vora]]]]
Portugal has developed a specific culture while being influenced by various civilizations that have crossed the Mediterranean and the European continent, or were introduced when it played an active role during the [[Portugal in the Age of Discovery|Age of Discovery]].
[[Image:Torre de Bel<U+00E9>m1.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Bel<U+00E9>m Tower]], built in the 1510s and a symbol of the [[Age of Discovery]], [[Lisbon]]]]
[[Portuguese literature]], one of the earliest Western literatures, developed through text and song. Until 1350, the [[Portuguese-Galician]] [[troubadour]]s spread their literary influence to most of the Iberian Peninsula.<ref> ''Poesia e Prosa Medievais'', p. 9, para. 4</ref> [[Gil Vicente]] (ca. 1465 - ca. 1536), was one of the founders of both Portuguese and Spanish dramatic traditions. Adventurer and poet [[Lu<U+00ED>s de Cam<U+00F5>es]] (ca. 1524-1580) wrote the epic poem ''[[The Lusiads]]'', with [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]] as his main influence. Modern Portuguese poetry is rooted in neoclassic and contemporary styles, as exemplified by [[Fernando Pessoa]] (1888<U+2013>1935). Modern Portuguese literature is represented by authors such as [[Almeida Garrett]], [[Camilo Castelo Branco]], [[E<U+00E7>a de Queir<U+00F3>s]], [[Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen]], and [[Ant<U+00F3>nio Lobo Antunes]]. Particularly popular and distinguished is [[Jos<U+00E9> Saramago]], winner of the 1998 [[Nobel Prize for literature]].

[[Image:Centro Cultural Belem 1.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Bel<U+00E9>m Cultural Center]], [[Lisbon]]]]
[[Music of Portugal|Portuguese music]] encompasses a wide variety of genres. The most renowned is [[fado]], a melancholy urban music, usually associated with the [[Portuguese guitar]] and ''saudade'', or longing. [[Coimbra fado]], a unique type of fado, is also noteworthy. Internationally notable performers include [[Am<U+00E1>lia Rodrigues]], [[Carlos Paredes]], [[Jos<U+00E9> Afonso]], [[Mariza]], [[Carlos do Carmo]], [[M<U+00ED>sia]], and [[Madredeus]]. One of the most notable Portuguese musical groups outside the country, and specially in [[Germany]], is the goth-metal band [[Moonspell]]. In addition to fado and folk, the Portuguese listen to pop and other types of modern music, particularly from [[North America]] and the [[British Isles]], as well as a wide range of Portuguese and Brazilian artists and bands.<ref>[http://home.planet.nl/~laar2337/apc2/Hitlijsten/Portugese-Top50.htm Portugese-Top50 stats]</ref> Bands with international recognition include [[Blasted Mechanism]] and [[The Gift (band)|The Gift]], both of which were nominated for an [[MTV Music Award]]. Portugal has several summer music festivals, such as ''[[Festival Sudoeste]]'' in [[Zambujeira do Mar]], ''[[Festival de Paredes de Coura]]'' in [[Paredes de Coura]], ''[[Festival Vilar de Mouros]]'' near [[Caminha]], and ''[[Rock in Rio Lisboa]]'' and ''[[Super Bock Super Rock]]'' in [[Lisbon]]. Out of the summer season, Portugal has a large number of festivals, designed more to an urban audience, like Flowfest or Hip Hop Porto. Furthermore, one of the largest international [[Goa trance]] festivals takes place in northern Portugal every two years, and the student festivals of ''[[Queima das Fitas]]'' are major events in a number of cities across Portugal.
In the Classical music domain, Portugal is represented by names as the pianist Maria Jo<U+00E3>o Pires, the violinist Carlos Damas and in the past by the great cellist Guilhermina Suggia.
[[Image:CasadaMusica.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Casa da M<U+00FA>sica]]'' (Music House), [[Porto]]]]
It has also a rich history as far as painting is concerned. The first well-known painters date back to the XV century <U+2013> like [[Nuno Gon<U+00E7>alves]] - were part of the Gothic painting period. 
[[Jos<U+00E9> Malhoa]], known for his work ''Fado'', and [[Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro]] (who painted the portraits of [[Te<U+00F3>filo Braga]] and [[Antero de Quental]]) were both references in naturalist painting.
[[Image:Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian Lisboa.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]], [[Lisbon]]]]
The 20th century saw the arrival of [[Modernism]], and along with it came the most prominent Portuguese painters: [[Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso]], who was heavily influenced by French painters, particularly by the [[Delaunays]]. Among his best known works is ''Can<U+00E7><U+00E3>o Popular a Russa e o F<U+00ED>garo''. Another great modernist painter/writer was [[Almada Negreiros]], friend to the poet [[Fernando Pessoa]], who painted his (Pessoa<U+2019>s) portrait. He was deeply influenced by both [[Cubist]] and [[Futurism (art)|Futurist]] trends. Prominent international figures in visual arts nowadays include painters [[Vieira da Silva]], [[J<U+00FA>lio Pomar]], and [[Paula Rego]].
Traditional architecture is distinctive. Modern Portugal has given the world renowned architects like [[Eduardo Souto de Moura]], [[<U+00C1>lvaro Siza Vieira]] and [[Gon<U+00E7>alo Byrne]]. Internally, [[Tom<U+00E1>s Taveira]] is also noteworthy.

Since the 1990s, Portugal has increased the number of public cultural facilities, in addition to the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]] established in 1956 in Lisbon. These include the [[Bel<U+00E9>m Cultural Center]] in Lisbon, [[Serralves Foundation]] and the [[Casa da M<U+00FA>sica]], both in [[Porto]], as well as new public cultural facilities like municipal libraries and concert halls which were built or renovated in many municipalities across the country.

[[Image:Pasteis.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Past<U+00E9>is de Nata]]'' (cream custards)]]
{{main|Portuguese Cuisine|Portuguese Wine}}
Portuguese cuisine is diverse. The Portuguese love dry [[cod]] (''[[bacalhau]]'' in Portuguese), for which there are hundreds of [[Bacalhau#Bacalhau dishes|recipes]]. There are more than enough ''[[bacalhau]]'' dishes for each day of the year. Two other popular fish recipes are grilled [[sardines]] and [[caldeirada]]. Typical Portuguese meat recipes, that may take [[beef]], [[pork]], [[domestic sheep|lamb]], or [[chicken]], include [[feijoada]], [[cozido <U+00E0> portuguesa]], [[frango de churrasco]], and [[carne de porco <U+00E0> alentejana]].[[Image:Porto.Grahams12.jpg|thumb|Vintage [[port wine|port]] from 1870 and 1873|left]]
Typical [[fast food]] dishes include the [[francesinha]] from Porto, and ''bifanas'' (grilled pork), ''prego'' (grilled beef) or ''leit<U+00E3>o'' ([[pig]]let) [[sandwiches]] which are well known around the country. The Portuguese art of [[pastry]] has its origins in ancient recipes of which [[past<U+00E9>is de Bel<U+00E9>m]] (or ''past<U+00E9>is de nata'') originally from Lisbon, and [[ovos-moles]] from Aveiro are good examples.

Portuguese wines have deserved international recognition since the times of the Roman Empire, which associated Portugal with their God [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. Today the country is known by wine lovers and its wines have won several international prizes. Some of the best Portuguese wines are: [[Vinho Verde]], [[Vinho Alvarinho]], [[Vinho do Douro]], [[Vinho do Alentejo]], [[Vinho do D<U+00E3>o]], [[Vinho da Bairrada]] and the sweet: [[Port Wine]], [[Madeira Wine]] and the [[Moscatel]] from [[Set<U+00FA>bal]] and [[Favaios]].
