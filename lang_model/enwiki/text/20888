'''York City Football Club''' is an [[England|English]] [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in [[York]], [[North Yorkshire]]. The club participates in the [[Conference National]], the fifth tier of English football. Founded in 1922, they joined [[The Football League]] in 1929, and have spent the majority of their history in the lower divisions. The club once rose as high as the second tier of English football, spending two seasons in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in the 1970s. In the 2003<U+2013>04 season the club lost their League status when they were relegated from the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]], and have since remained in the Conference.

York have enjoyed more success in cup competitions than in the league, with highlights including an [[FA Cup]] semi-final appearance in 1955. In the [[1995-96 in English football|1995<U+2013>96]] [[Football League Cup|Coca-Cola Cup]], York beat [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 3<U+2013>0 at [[Old Trafford (football)|Old Trafford]];  Manchester United went on to win the [[FA Cup]] and [[Premier League|Premiership]] [[The Double#The English Double|double]] that season.

York play their home games at [[KitKat Crescent]] in York. This stadium was formerly known as Bootham Crescent, but was renamed KitKat Crescent because of a sponsorship deal with [[Nestl<U+00E9>]], whose confectionery factory, formerly known as [[Rowntrees]], is one the city's largest employers.

The club turned professional in 1912 and joined the [[Midland Football League|Midland League]], where they played for three seasons, rising as high as tenth position.  They played their final season in [[1914-15 in English football|1914<U+2013>15]] before folding in 1917 during the [[First World War]].<ref name="YORK CITY{1}"/>

The club was re-founded in 1922 by members of the former club.  These members founded a [[limited company]] and gained admission to the [[Midland Football League|Midland League]] where they played in  for seven seasons, achieving a highest finish of sixth, in both [[1924-25 in English football|1924<U+2013>25]] and [[1926-27 in English football|1926<U+2013>27]].<ref name="YORK CITY">{{cite web

In 1958, York became founding members of the Fourth Division, as the Third Divisions North and [[Football League Third Division South|South]] were restructured into new Third and [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth]] divisions, based on league positions at the end of the [[1957-58 in English football|1957-58]] season. They missed out on the runner-up spot in the inaugural season only on [[goal difference|goal average]], and were promoted to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in third place, but were relegated back after just one season. A second promotion in [[1964-65 in English football|1964-65]], again in third place in the Fourth Division, saw a similar instant relegation back from the Third Division the next season. York's record of promotion every six years was maintained by a team sporting the future [[England national football team|England]] forward [[Phil Boyer]] in [[1970-71 in English football|1970-71]], and this time the team managed to stay in the Third Division, albeit only on goal difference in both the next two seasons. 

After these two seasons the team hit form in the [[1973-74 in English football|1973<U+2013>74]] season, when "three up, three down" promotion and relegation was introduced to the Football League. After being among the leaders all season York City were eventually promoted to [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] in third place.  Their first season in the Second Division saw York finish in their highest ever league position, 15th place.<ref name="Brief History"/>  On [[March 29]], [[1975]], they played in front of the highest ever League crowd to see them &ndash; 46,802 at [[Old Trafford (football ground)|Old Trafford]] in a 2<U+2013>1 defeat to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].

==Crest==
[[Image:Yorkcityoldlogo.jpg|right|thumb|130px|York City crest: 1978-2002.]]York City originally had a crest which depicted the [[York Minster]] and a [[White Rose of York]]. This was replaced in the 1970s, when the club switched to a Y-shaped logo which featured on the front of the shirts.<ref name="YCFC Kit guide">{{cite web
| title = YCFC Kit guide
| url = http://www.yorkcityfc.com/club/ycfckits.php

In 1978 a new crest was introduced by York City, which depicted the [[York city walls#Bars|Bootham Bar]], two red lions and the club name.<ref name="York City historical"/> When John Batchelor took over as chairman of the club in 2002, the crest was replaced by one showing the club's new name of "York City Soccer Club".<ref name="YCFC Kit guide"/>

After Batchelor's time in charge, the club name returned to "Football Club" and a new logo was introduced. The design for this logo was selected following a competition featured in York's [[The Press (York)|Evening Press]] newspaper.  This logo is still used by the club and shows five lions, four blue on a white background and one white on a red background.

Throughout the majority of the history of the club, York City have worn red shirts with white shorts. However, in the club's first season, [[1922-23 in English football|1922<U+2013>23]], maroon shirts were worn, with white shorts and black socks.  Moreover, in the 1930s, York changed their maroon jerseys to chocolate and cream stripes, a reference to the city's association with the confectionery industry. After five years they changed their colours to what were described as "distinctive red shirts", with the official explanation that the striped jerseys clashed with opponents too often. To mark York's promotion to the Second Division in 1974, a bold white "Y" was added to the teams shirts, with the club coming to be referred to as the "Y-fronts". In 1979, red shirts returned, along with navy shorts.<ref name="York City historical"/>

In June 2003, York City agreed a deal for [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] to provide the clubs kits.<ref name="Minstermen agree Nike deal">{{cite news

[[Image:Kit kat cres 07.jpg|right|thumb|250px|KitKat Crescent in 2007.]]
Between 1921 and 1932 York City played their home games at Fulfordgate.<ref name="Fulfordgate">{{cite web
| title = Fulfordgate
| url = http://www.soccerbase.com/grounds2.sd?groundid=112
| publisher = soccerbase
| accessdate = 2007-03-26}}</ref> York purchased the land for Bootham Crescent, a former cricket ground, in summer 1932, as it was closer to the club's centre of support and the railway station than Fulfordgate. Bootham Crescent was converted into a football ground; a main stand was built and a roof was erected above the Popular stand. The ground opened on [[31 August]] [[1932]]. In March 1938, the ground's record attendance was set when 28,123 people watched York City play [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].<ref name="The History of Bootham Crescent">{{cite web
| title = The History of Bootham Crescent
| url = http://www.yorkcityfc.com/club/bc_history.php
| publisher = Red and Blue NET
| accessdate = 2007-03-26}}</ref> 

Bootham Crescent was damaged during [[World War II]] when a bomb landed on the Shipton Street End, but shortly after the war ended, the terracing was laid properly with concrete. At this point most of the ground was still uncovered. The stadium was fitted with floodlights in 1959, which were used for the first time in a friendly against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on [[28 October]], [[1959]].<ref name="The History of Bootham Crescent"/>

During the mid-1980s, <U+00A3>300,000 was spent on a series of improvements to the Bootham Crescent ground, which was funded by money generated during York City's [[FA Cup]] run in the 1984<U+2013>85 season, which included games against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and then [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], including a replay at Liverpool in front of a crowd of 43,000. The improvements included building hospitality suites behind the main stand, new club offices, turnstiles, new crush barriers, and the addition of more seats to the Popular Stand, giving a seating capacity of 2,883 seats out of a total capacity of 13,185.<ref name="The History of Bootham Crescent"/>

The capacity of Bootham Crescent had at one time been 12,475, with 3,245 seats, but this was reduced in 1994 because of an increase to the family area of the Main stand due to popular demand, and alterations to enable the ground to comply with the recommendations made in the [[Taylor Report]]. It saw 326 seats replacing a standing area, reducing capacity. Stricter rules concerning the density of people standing resulting from the Taylor Report further reduced capacity.<ref name="The History of Bootham Crescent"/>

New floodlights were installed during the summer of 1995, costing <U+00A3>122,000. These floodlights are twice as bright as the original floodlights, and meet the requirements for Division One football. A drainage system was installed to improve the quality of the pitch during winter, costing several thousand pounds. A water tower was also installed in the late 1990s.<ref name="The History of Bootham Crescent"/>

York had planned a move to [[Huntington Stadium]] in 2003, but withdrew their application as they were given a loan of <U+00A3>2 million from the Football Stadia Improvement Fund, which secured the purchase of Bootham Crescent.<ref name="Spread the news on new York City">{{cite news

The new stadium will be similar to [[Princes Park, Dartford|Princes Park]] of [[Dartford F.C.|Dartford FC]], but will hold a larger capacity. Steve Galloway, City of York Council leader, said his aspiration was for a 10,000-seater stadium to be built, which would be home to both York City and [[York City Knights]], although, speaking at the launch of his party's election manifesto on [[3 April]], [[2007]], he said it may be smaller initially, at 6,000 or 7,000 seats.<ref name="York City FC on verge of stadium deal"/>
