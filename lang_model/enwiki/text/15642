'''USS ''Robinson'' (DD-562)''', a [[Fletcher class destroyer|''Fletcher''-class]] [[destroyer]], was the second ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for [[Captain#Naval|Captain]] [[Isaiah Robinson]] (died c. [[1781]]), who served in the [[Continental Navy]].

''Robinson'' was laid down on [[12 August]] [[1942]] by the [[Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corp.]], [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle, Wash.]]; [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] [[28 August]] [[1943]], sponsored by Mrs. [[Howard M. Sayers]]; and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] [[31 January]] [[1944]], [[Commander]] Elonzo B. Grantham, Jr., in command.

After shakedown out of [[Naval Station San Diego|San Diego]], ''Robinson'', departed Seattle [[12 April]] for [[Hawaii]]. Arriving at [[Pearl Harbor]] [[21 April]], she trained until getting underway on [[29 May]] with Task Force 52 (TF&nbsp;52), headed for [[Eniwetok]] and the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]].

== Marianas campaign ==

On the morning of [[15 June]], ''Robinson'' opened fire in the [[battle of Saipan]] and her first salvo set off a large explosion, followed by an oil fire. She then silenced four enemy batteries which had been firing on [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] on the southernmost landing beaches, "Beach Yellow One". She then scored a direct hit on an enemy [[pillbox]] on [[Tinian]]. The destroyer joined the screen of [[battleship]] [[USS Tennessee (BB-43)|''Tennessee'']] (BB-43), at nightfall and in 2 hours fought off five enemy aircraft. She then teamed with destroyers [[USS Selfridge (DD-357)|''Selfridge'']] (DD-357) and [[USS Albert W. Grant (DD-649)|''Albert W. Grant'']] (DD-649) in the screen of [[cruiser]] [[USS Birmingham (CL-62)|''Birmingham'']] (CL-62) off the western coast of Tinian, delivering harassing fire throughout the night.

At daybreak [[16 June]], ''Robinson'' resumed fire support to the Marines on the southernmost invasion beaches of [[Saipan]]. During the morning, she silenced all but one stubborn gun of an enemy [[artillery]] emplacement and her fire assisted in turning back enemy tanks. Toward noon, she began safeguarding the transports off Saipan. At nightfall, she turned to call-fire duty off "Beach Green One". Throughout the night of [[16 June]] and into the morning of the 17th, ''Robinson'' illuminated and fired upon counterattacking Japanese tank divisions twice driving them back from the beachhead. That afternoon, she took fire support station, then spent the night and the next 5 days, protecting troop transports off Saipan.

Retiring to Eniwetok with empty transports [[26 June]], she returned to Saipan on [[6 July]] in the escort screen of a reinforcement [[convoy]].

''Robinson'' took antisubmarine patrol station northwest of Saipan that day and closed the shore at night to provide illumination fire and send salvos into enemy troops east of [[Marpi Point]]. She shifted her fire to the west, to Tanapag Harbor the following morning and during the afternoon, rescued 17 Marines from a reef north of the harbor where they had been isolated by one of the biggest [[banzai attack]]s of the war.

''Robinson'' served on antisubmarine patrol off Saipan, in the ocean area northwest of [[Maniagassa Island]], until [[20 July]], then got underway with [[USS Overton (APD-23)|''Overton'']] (APD-23) to escort 11 [[Tank landing craft|LCT]]s which arrived off [[Guam]] the next morning. She resumed fire support off Saipan that evening. On [[22 July]] ''Robinson'' shifted her fire to Tinian, hitting caves where the enemy had dug in. She bombarded the western shore of Tinian 25 and [[26 July]]; and, after gunfire support on the 29th, she guarded the minesweepers in [[Asiga Bay]].

Departing Tinian on [[31 July]], she escorted the hospital transport ship, [[USS Tryon (APH-1)|''Tryon'']] (APH-1) to Eniwetok; then steamed independently to [[Noum<U+00E9>a]], [[New Caledonia]], where she arrived [[9 August]].

== Peleliu ==

''Robinson'' cleared Noum<U+00E9>a on [[22 August]] and touched at [[Espiritu Santo]], [[New Hebrides Islands]], to rejoin other ships of her division, then arrived at [[Purvis Bay]] of [[Florida Island|Florida]], [[Solomon Islands]] on the 26th. She stood out from Purvis Bay on [[6 September]], with [[Rear Admiral]] [[Jesse B. Oldendorf]]'s bombardment group, and arrived off [[Peleliu]] Island, on the morning of the 12th for pre-invasion bombardment. During the [[Battle of Peleliu]], ''Robinson'' wiped out enemy machine gun emplacements and tumbled snipers out of trees as she blasted enemy troop concentrations near "White" and "Orange" beaches. At various times, she assisted in screening cruisers [[USS Louisville (CA-28)|''Louisville'']] (CA-28) and [[USS Portland (CA-33)|''Portland'']] (CA-33) and battleships [[USS Idaho (BB-42)|''Idaho'']] (BB-42) and [[USS Mississippi (BB-41)|''Mississippi'']] (BB-41). She also raked the beach area during the daylight hours to cover [[underwater demolition team]]s, and she carried out call fire missions on enemy troops and gun batteries. On [[22 September]], she knocked out all guns in her area and disabled two groups of enemy [[tank]]s. She continued to hit emplacements, troop areas and supply dumps until the early morning of [[24 September]] [[1944]] when she teamed with [[USS Heywood L. Edwards (DD-663)|''Heywood L. Edwards'']] (DD-663) in destroying enemy barges attempting to land troops and supplies on the north shore. That evening she screened cruiser ''Louisville'' to [[Kossol Passage]]. 

She spent the night of [[26 September]] providing illumination and harassing fire on the north end of [[Angaur Island]]. She gave the same treatment to [[Ngesebus Island]] the next night and bombarded the beaches south of Ngesebus airfields during the day of the 28th. She spent the night of 28<U+2013>[[29 September]] delivering night illumination fire on the northwest corner of Angaur and entered [[Seeadler Harbor]], [[Manus Island|Manus]], [[Admiralty Islands]], [[1 October]].

== Philippines campaign ==

''Robinson'' cleared Seeadler Harbor on the 12th, and headed for the [[Philippine Islands]]. On [[17 October]] [[1944]], she joined the [[Dinagat Island|Dinagat]] Attack Group. With [[light cruiser]]s [[USS Denver (CL-58)|''Denver'']] (CL-58) and [[USS Columbia (CL-56)|''Columbia'']] (CL-56), and three other destroyers, ''Robinson'' supported the Dinagat Attack Group and set course for Dinagat and the three smaller islands, [[Calicoan]], [[Suluan]], and [[Homonhon]], which divided the two entrances to [[Leyte Gulf]] and were suspected of harboring enemy search radar. To put these enemy warning stations out of action, the attack group arrived off the islands at daybreak of [[17 October]]. Cruiser ''Denver'' had the honor of firing the opening gun for the [[Battle of Leyte|liberation of Leyte]] at 08:00 and Company D of the [[6th Ranger Battalion|6th Rangers]] was landed on [[Suluan Island]] some 20 minutes later<U+2014>the first Americans to "return" to the Philippines. ''Robinson'' escorted the Ranger unit to Dinagat Island where they made an unopposed landing. She then covered [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s in Leyte Gulf until their retirement on the morning of [[19 October]]. Her guns raked the invasion beaches ahead of the troops landing on [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]], [[20 October]] [[1944]], and she delivered illumination fire over the eastern shore of Leyte throughout the night. On [[22 October]], she rescued a downed American fighter pilot. On [[24 October]] ''Robinson'' destroyed enemy installations on the slope of [[Catmon Hill]], Leyte.

At 17:10 on [[24 October]], ''Robinson'' was relieved from fire support duties and joined a screen for five cruisers on the left flank of the northern entrance to [[Surigao Strait]]. The destroyers were divided into three attack sections and severely mauled the attacking [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]]. By early morning [[25 October]], the enemy was limping off in retreat, having lost two battleships, two destroyers and a cruiser. ''Robinson'' made rendezvous with the destroyers of section 3 to the north of [[Hibuson Island]] after her [[torpedo]] attack, and vainly attempted to rescue the many Japanese survivors who refused all efforts to save them. At 07:58, [[25 October]], ''Robinson'' joined other destroyers and cruisers in anticipation of meeting enemy surface and air units retiring from the fierce action with the escort carriers off the east coast of [[Samar]]. She cruised east of Leyte until [[29 October]] to cover shipping in and near Leyte Gulf. She assisted in fighting off enemy air raids and escorted the bomb-damaged [[USS Killen (DD-593)|''Killen'']] (DD-593) to her anchorage in [[San Pedro Bay (Philippines)|San Pedro Bay]] on [[1 November]]. She was temporarily detached from the [[task group]] on [[4 November]] for picket duty in Surigao Strait and rejoined the bombardment group on [[13 November]] as it set course for Manus. She teamed with [[USS Bryant (DD-665)|''Bryant'']] (DD-665) to shoot down an enemy plane which approached the formation on the 16th, and entered Seeadler Harbor on the 21st.

''Robinson'' stood out of Seeadler Harbor on [[28 November]] for Leyte Gulf where on [[1 December]] she was detached from Destroyer Division 112 (DesDiv 112) of [[Destoyer Squadron 56]] (DesRon 56) and reported to [[Destroyer Squadron 22]] for duty. The next day she got underway in the screen of battleships and cruisers for Kossol Passage, where she teamed with 14 other destroyers in the screen of six [[escort aircraft carrier|escort carrier]]s, seven cruisers, and three battleships, acting as distant cover for troop convoys bound for the [[Battle of Mindoro|assault on Mindoro]], Philippine Islands. She assisted in driving off enemy aircraft as she guarded the escort carriers from 13 to [[15 December]]. The troops hit the beach at [[Mindoro]] on the 15th and ''Robinson'' returned to Seeadler Harbor with the task group on the 23d.

On [[31 December]] ''Robinson'' and the five other destroyers of DesRon 22 sailed from Seeadler Harbor in the screen for Transport Group "Able" of the Lingayen Attack Force, carrying the [[27th Infantry Division (United States)|27th Infantry Division]] for the initial landings at [[Lingayen Gulf]], [[Luzon]], in the Philippines. ''Robinson'' screened northwest of the transport area on the morning of [[9 January]] [[1945]] as the first waves of [[amphibious assault]] troops landed. She anchored in the transport area that night and survived a pre-dawn attack by a Japanese suicide boat. The [[underwater explosion]]s temporarily put her [[sonar]] equipment out of commission but did no other serious damage. At daybreak, ''Robinson'''s gunners fought off a diving [[kamikaze]] suicide plane and knocked it down in a spinning ball of flame. At dusk she opened fire on another suicide plane diving at a highspeed transport. That enemy missed its target and crashed into the sea. ''Robinson'' returned to Leyte Gulf with the empty transports on the 15th.

She got underway from San Pedro Bay on [[18 January]] to escort the [[attack transport]] [[USS Comet (APA-166)|''Comet'']] (APA-166) to [[Teluk Yos Sudarso|Humboldt Bay]], [[Hollandia]], [[New Guinea]], and returned on [[3 February]] escorting [[USS Wright (AG-79)|''Wright'']] (AG-79). After installation of fighter-director radio equipment, she cleared port with [[USS Harmon (DE-678)|''Harmon'']] (DE-678) and [[USS Greenwood (DE-679)|''Greenwood'']] (DE-679) in the screen for [[amphibious command ship]] [[USS Blue Ridge (AGC-2)|''Blue Ridge'']] (AGC-2) and three transports; and headed for Lingayen Gulf where she performed patrol duty. She returned to San Pedro Bay with the empty troopship on [[26 February]], and sailed the next day with [[USS Bancroft (DD-598)|''Bancroft'']] (DD-598), escorting Rear Adm. [[Forrest B. Royal]]'s amphibious command ship, [[USS Rocky Mount (AGC-3)|''Rocky Mount'']] (AGC-3) which reached [[Mangarin Bay]], Mindoro, on [[1 March]]. That same day, ''Robinson'' put to sea in the screen for Task Group 78.1 (TG&nbsp;78.1). The American ships arrived off the [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] of [[Mindanao]] early in the morning of [[10 March]], and ''Robinson'' took station off [[Coldera Point]] as troops stormed ashore under the cover of a rocket barrage. During the night, she teamed with [[USS McCalla (DD-488)|''McCalla'']] (DD-488) for gunfire support, knocking out an enemy gun emplacement and hitting enemy pillboxes inland. On the 16th, she bombarded [[Isabela City]], [[Basilan Island]], creating a diversion while [[United States Army|Army troops]] landed at [[Kulibato Point]] to the east. Assisted by spotting aircraft, she shelled a wharf and the area of suspected enemy underground trenches. On the evening of [[18 March]], she responded to the request of shore fire-control parties by blasting a Japanese troop concentration of about 150 men in the [[Gumularang River]] Valley of Basilan Island, giving support to American Army and guerilla troops. She anchored off the [[Santa Cruz Bank]] from 20 to [[24 March]].

''Robinson'' joined Task Group 78.2 at Mangarin Bay on [[10 April]] [[1945]] and sailed 4 days later. She rescued two Marine aviators from the sea on the 16th. The next day, the task group entered [[Polloc Harbor]] of Mindanao and Army troops were landed for the assault against the [[Malabang]]-[[Parang]]-[[Catobato]] area of Mindanao. ''Robinson'' returned to Mangarin Bay with the empty shipping on [[24 April]] and sailed the next day escorting a convoy carrying reinforcements to Polloc Harbor. She cleared that port on [[28 April]] escorting [[Oiler (ship)|oiler]] [[USS Winooski (AO-38)|''Winooski'']] (AO-38) via [[Tawi Tawi]], [[Sulu Archipelago]], Philippine Islands, to [[Muara Batagao]], [[Tarakan Island|Tarakan]], [[Borneo]]. She reached her destination on [[2 May]], the day after the initial assault on Tarakan, and bombarded an enemy-defended ridge north of the airfield and a supply road junction. She got underway from Tarakan Island on [[8 May]], escorting amphibious ships to the [[Netherlands East Indies]], arriving at [[Morotai]] 2 days later.

== Borneo ==

On [[4 June]], ''Robinson'' sailed with Task Group 78.1 which arrived in [[Brunei Bay]], British Northwest Borneo on [[10 June]]. The landing was unopposed and ''Robinson'' joined the antisubmarine screen for [[USS Nashville (CL-43)|''Nashville'']] (CL-43) and [[USS Phoenix (CL-46)|''Phoenix'']] (CL-46) en route to Tawi Tawi. She then sailed with [[USS Philip (DD-498)|''Philip'']] (DD-498) and arrived at Morotai, [[20 June]]. She again stood out to sea on [[26 June]] in the screen for amphibious ships which landed troops on the beach at [[Balikpapan]], Borneo, on the morning of [[1 July]] [[1945]]. She conducted antisubmarine and picket patrol off Balikpapan until [[15 July]] and returned to Morotai with one echelon of the empty troopships on the 19th. Three days later she teamed with [[USS Waller (DD-466)|''Waller'']] (DD-466) to escort small craft to San Pedro Bay, arriving on the 25th.

''Robinson'' departed San Pedro Bay on [[5 August]] [[1945]], and arrived at [[Ulithi]], [[7 August]] [[1945]]. She took [[radar picket]] station some 50&nbsp;miles from Ulithi from 10 to [[13 August]]. Three days later she sailed escorting troopship [[USS Admiral Benson (AP-120)|''Admiral Benson'']] (AP-120) to San Pedro Bay; then continued on alone to [[Subic Bay]], Luzon, where she arrived on the 21st. 

== China ==

On [[3 September]] she put to sea with the [[Yangtze River Patrol Force]] under Rear Adm. [[C. Turner Joy]], but broke off from the main body to head for [[Okinawa]] and arrived in [[Buckner Bay]] on the morning of [[5 September]]. That same day Captain Campbell was designated commander of the newly organized Minesweeper Task Group 73.2 with ''Robinson'' as [[flagship]]. She put to sea with six minesweepers on the night of [[5 September]]; and, 2 days later, the task unit began minesweeping operations in the approaches to and the entrance of the [[Yangtze]]. These lasted until December. On the 12th ''Robinson'' sailed from [[Shanghai]] for the United States and reached San Diego on [[30 December]].

''Robinson'', with ''Waller'', [[USS Saufley (DD-465)|''Saufley'']] (DD-465), ''Philip'', and [[USS Renshaw (DD-499)|''Renshaw'']] (DD-499) was assigned to the newly formed Destroyer Division 301 of [[Destroyer Squadron 30]] at San Diego. She cleared San Diego on [[12 January]] [[1946]] and arrived at [[Brooklyn, N.Y.]], on the 26th. She cleared port on [[4 March]], and entered the [[Charleston Navy Yard]] on the 7th for inactivation overhaul, and decommissioned on [[12 June]] [[1946]].

== 1951 <U+2013> 1954 ==

''Robinson'' remained in reserve until recommissioned at the Charleston Naval Shipyard on [[3 August]] [[1951]]. She was assigned to Destroyer Division 321 and on [[9 September]] became the flagship of [[Destroyer Squadron 32]]. After sea trials off [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston, S.C.]], she arrived at [[Naval Station Norfolk|Norfolk, Va.]] on [[2 December]] for shakedown training in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and off the [[Virginia Capes]]. She got underway from Norfolk on [[10 January]] [[1952]] for maneuvers in the [[Caribbean Sea]] and returned on [[6 March]] for squadron tactics and plane guard exercises with [[USS Saipan (CVL-48)|''Saipan'']] (CVL-48) and [[USS Midway (CVB-41)|''Midway'']] (CVB-41) off the Virginia Capes. She subsequently operated off the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean until getting underway from Norfolk on [[29 June]] [[1953]] for 6 months in the [[Pacific Ocean|western Pacific]]. The destroyer transited the [[Panama Canal]] and arrived at [[U.S. Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka, Japan]] on [[3 August]] [[1953]]. ''Robinson'' performed plane guard duty with Carrier Task Force 77 off the coast of [[Korea]], participated in hunter-killer exercises off [[Kobe, Hyogo|Kobe]], [[Japan]], escorted [[USS Point Cruz (CVE-119)|''Point Cruz'']] (CVE-119) to [[Inchon]], Korea, patrolled off the east coast of Korea, and visited [[Pusan]] and [[Asau Wan]], [[Tsushima]]. ''Robinson'' then returned home via the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Mediterranean]], reaching Norfolk on [[6 February]] [[1954]].

After operations along the Atlantic coast, ''Robinson'' made a [[midshipman]] practice cruise with battleship [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|''Missouri'']] (BB-63) visiting [[Vigo]], [[Spain]], and [[Le Havre]], [[France]], and [[Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]], [[Cuba]], before returning to Norfolk on [[3 August]].

== 1955 <U+2013> 1958 ==

After operations off the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean, ''Robinson'' was again bound for the Mediterranean in company with Destroyer Squadrons 8 and 32 on [[5 November]] [[1955]]. She visited such Mediterranean ports as [[Rhodes]], [[Greece]]; and [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]; before steaming for [[Greenwich]], [[England]]; [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]]; [[Bremerhaven]], [[Germany]]; and [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]. After independent operations in waters to the north of the [[Shetland Islands]], she arrived at [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]] on [[27 January]] for [[antisubmarine warfare]] and convoy exercises with British warships. This duty terminated [[13 February]] [[1956]] and ''Robinson'' returned to Norfolk on the 22d for antisubmarine operations in the Virginia Capes, and shore bombardment practice at [[Bloodsworth Island]].

Early in June 1956, ''Robinson'' embarked midshipmen at [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]] and cleared Norfolk on [[5 June]] for a midshipman cruise. After exercise "Coppersmith" with units of the [[Danish Navy]], she visited [[Copenhagen]] until the 26th, then set course for [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]], England. She visited Guantanamo Bay before debarking the midshipmen at Annapolis and returning to Norfolk on [[1 August]].

''Robinson'' cleared Norfolk with Destroyer Squadron 32 on [[22 October]] [[1957]] and touched at [[Bermuda]] before arrival at [[Gibraltar]] on [[31 October]]. She put to sea the next day in company with [[USS Ross (DD-563)|''Ross'']] (DD-563) for the [[Persian Gulf]], visiting [[Piraeus]], Greece, and touching at [[Port Said]] on [[7 November]] before transit of the Suez Canal for visits to [[Aden]], [[Arabia]]; and [[Massawa]], [[Eritrea]]. She arrived at [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]], [[25 November]] [[1957]]. Based at the last named port, she participated in Operation Crescent with Navy warships of Pakistan, [[Turkey]], [[Great Britain]], and [[Iran]]. She got underway from Karachi, Pakistan, on [[11 December]], steamed by way of Massawa, and transited the Suez Canal on the 19th for maneuvers with the [[U.S. 6th Fleet|6th Fleet]] in the Mediterranean. She sailed from Gibraltar on the 16th and arrived at Norfolk on [[5 March]] [[1958]].

== 1958 <U+2013> 1964 ==

''Robinson'' departed Norfolk again on [[9 June]] [[1958]] on a midshipmen training cruise to [[A Coru<U+00F1>a]], [[Galicia (Spain)]]; [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]]; and [[Hamburg]], Germany, before debarking the midshipmen at Annapolis on 4 and [[5 August]]. After 7 months of operations from Norfolk, on [[8 April]] [[1959]], ''Robinson'' was assigned to Reserve Destroyer Squadron 4, Destroyer Flotilla 4, [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet]], and began a new career training reservists. On [[1 July]], the destroyer sailed for [[Naval Station Charleston|Charleston]], her new [[homeport]] where she operated for the next 5 years.
