The '''music of Minnesota''' has played a role in the historical and cultural development of [[Minnesota]].  As with the culture of Minnesota in general, the state's music scene centers on the [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul]] area, and most of the Minnesotan artists who have become nationally popular either came from that area or debuted there.  Rural Minnesota has also produced a flourishing folk music scene, with a long tradition of traditional [[music of Sweden|Swedish]], [[music of Finland|Finnish]] and [[music of Norway|Norwegian music]].<ref name="Garland">''Garland'', pp. 866 - 881</ref> Minnesota's modern local music scene is home to thousands of local bands, many of which perform with some regularity.<ref>[http://musicscene.org/ Music Scene.org] <small>An incomplete listing of local bands at MusicScene.org has 2,241 entries as of February 2005, while a concert calendar compiled by the [[University of Minnesota Twin Cities|University of Minnesota]]'s radio station usually lists dozens of performances each week in the Twin Cities</ref>  Some performers from nearby regions of neighboring states, such as western Wisconsin and Fargo, North Dakota, are often considered a part of the Minnesota music scene.  

Minneapolis has produced a number of famous performers, such as [[Bob Dylan]], who was born in Duluth, grew up in Hibbing, and began his musical career in the Minneapolis area, and [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]], who eventually formed [[The Time (band)|The Time]] and [[record producer|produced]] for [[Gladys Knight]] and [[Janet Jackson]].  Minneapolis' most influential contributions to [[American popular music]] began in the 1970s and 1980s, when the city's music scene "expanded the state's cultural identity" and launched the careers of acclaimed performers like the multi-platinum [[soul music|soul]] singer [[Prince (artist)|Prince]], and cult favorites [[The Replacements]] and [[H<U+00FC>sker D<U+00FC>]]. More recently, the Twin Cities has played a role in the national hip-hop scene with artists such as [[Atmosphere (music group)|Atmosphere]] and [[P.O.S.]].<ref>[http://www.mnhs.org/collections/mplsmusic/index.htm Minneapolis Music Collection] <small>''In the mid-1970s and early 1980s, the creative explosion in Minnesota's thriving black and white rock music scenes expanded the state's cultural identity far beyond the shores of Lake Wobegon.''</ref>

== Institutions and venues ==
[[Image:Orch hall.jpg|thumb|[[Orchestra Hall (Minneapolis)|Orchestra Hall]], [[Nicollet Mall]], [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]]]]
Music institutions in modern Minnesota include the [[Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra]], the only full-time professional chamber orchestra in the country, and the [[Minnesota Orchestra]], a pioneering institution that was among the first orchestras to perform on the radio and to record.  The Minnesota Orchestra was founded in 1903 as the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra.  The Minnesota Orchestra is widely respected in the classical music world, and has toured widely; as of 2005, the orchestra is led by music director [[Osmo V<U+00E4>nsk<U+00E4>]], a Finnish [[Conducting|conductor]], who has recently launched a program to record the complete works of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]].<ref>[http://www.minnesotaorchestra.org/about/index.cfm About the MOA] <small>The first disc was released on the [[BIS]] label in 2005, covering the 4th and 5th symphonies.</ref>  The [[Minnesota Opera]] is an important local music institution, and claims to be the sixteenth largest opera company in the United States.  The Opera was founded in 1963, as part of the [[Walker Art Center]], and became an independent company in 1969.  The Minnesota Opera described its early reputation as "progressive (and) 'alternative'" in comparison to the more staid [[St. Paul Opera]], which merged with the Minnesota Opera in 1975.<ref>[http://www.mnopera.org/ Minnesota Opera]</ref>  In the field of folk music, Minnesota has produced the [[Scandinavian Music Ensemble]], a long-running group that performs in the traditional styles of Scandinavian-Americans, particularly [[music of Norway|Norwegian music]].<ref>[http://www.musicoutfitters.com/artists/larson.htm Leroy Larson and the Scandinavian Music Ensemble]</ref>

=== Industry and media ===
[[Image:MPR-2006-12-19.jpg|thumb|[[Minnesota Public Radio]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]]]]
The [[Independent Public Radio]] is a state-wide network of twelve independently-owned stations that play music by local artists.  These stations include [[KFAI]], [[KUMB]], [[KAXE]] and [[KVSC]], most of whom also operate [[Internet radio]] streams.  Local music is also a part of the [[playlist]]s of Minnesota's [[Campus radio|college radio]] stations like the [[University of Minnesota]]'s [[Radio K]] and [[Macalaster College]]'s [[WMCN]].  Most other radio stations in the state are owned by conglomerates like [[Clear Channel]], and play few, if any local artists; they instead use a national [[radio format]], mostly playing classic rock, pop, and contemporary hip hop and R&B.  [[Minnesota Public Radio]] is also a major part of the Minnesota radio industry; it is one of the most successful public radio organizations in the country, and has grown from a small station associated with [[College of Saint Benedict/Saint John's University|St. John's University]] in [[Collegeville, Minnesota|Collegeville]] in 1967, to a part of the [[American Public Media Group]] and is now the dominant network of radio stations in the state. Recently MPR launched a new station, KCMP 89.3, [[KCMP|The Current]], which has gained a cult following throughout the country and indeed throughout the world thanks to its Internet presence.<ref>[http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/features/weekly/05-02-21-minnesota-becomes-eclectic.shtml Pitchfork]</ref>

The Minneapolis-St Paul area is home to a free alternative [[weekly]] that promotes local music performers and venues, called the ''Pulse of the Twin Cities''.<ref>[http://www.pulsetc.com/mod.php?mod=userpage&menu=902&page_id=4 ''Pulse of the Twin Cities'']</ref>Minnesota is also home to [http://www.earplugradio.com Earplug Radio] a social music community for local artists. Minnesota is home to music festivals devoted to several styles of music, including Ironworld U.S.A.'s [[International Polkafest]], [[Minnesota Bluegrass and Old-Time Music Festival]] and the [[Minnesota Folk Festival]].  The [[Detroit Lakes, Minnesota|Detroit Lakes]] annual [[10,000 Lakes Festival]] is an important part of modern Minnesota's music; it features major [[jam band]]s and [[indie rock]] bands at concerts like [[WE Fest]] and the [[Moondance Jam]].  The [[Bayfront Blues Festival]] is held on [[Lake Superior]] in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]; the Bayfront Festival promoters also put on the Blues on the Range Festival in [[Chisholm, Minnesota|Chisholm]] and the [[Apple River Blues Festival]] in [[Somerset, Wisconsin]].  The original Bayfront Blues Festival dates to 1989, and it has since grown to become one of the premier blues festivals in the country.<ref>[http://www.mnblues.com/review/pr-bayfront99.html Minnesota Blues]</ref>  The Minnesota blues scene includes several other regionally important festivals, such as the [[Boundary Waters Blues Festival]], founded by [[Michael Jankovec]] a radio host on local station [[WELY]],<ref>[http://www.elyblues.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3&Itemid=5%20 Ely Blues]</ref> and the [[St. Paul Bluesfest]]. 

Many local performers record for one of several regional labels in Minneapolis and elsewhere in the state. Some of these labels are well-known in their field, such as [[Red House Records|Red House]], a prominent folk label, and the Twin/Tone indie rock label. In addition to record labels, Minneapolis has been home to several important recording studios. The first studio in the state was [[Kay Bank]], established by studio engineer [[Bruce Swedien]] in the 1950s; the studio's first hits were from [[The Trashmen]] ("Surfin' Bird") and [[Dave Dudley]] ("Six Days on the Road"), which helped popularize a distinctive Kay Bank style based on using three-track recording and echo effects. [[Herb Pilhofer]] and [[Tom Jung]] worked at Kay Banks before founding [[Sound 80]] in 1969.  Sound 80 recorded numerous local artists over the years, ranging from part of Bob Dylan's ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'' to works from [[Dave Brubeck]]. Though the Sound 80 building was sold in 1990, the studio is now an [[anechoic chamber]] labeled the "quietest place on Earth" by the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]''. [[Flyte Tyme Productions]], a soul and R&B studio led by [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]], defined the ''[[Minneapolis sound]]'' in the 1980s with albums like [[Janet Jackson]]'s ''[[Control (Janet Jackson album)|Control]]''. Other important studios in Minneapolis include the [[Dove (recording studio)|Dove]] studio, which released several cult classic psychedelic and garage rock recordings in the 1960s, and [[Blackberry Wray]], founded by [[Paul Stark]], who would later found the Twin/Tone record label. Blackberry Wray recorded many local alternative rock performers like [[The Replacements]] and [[Soul Asylum]], while Twin/Tone was home to [[The Suburbs]] and [[The Fingerprints]], among others.<ref>[http://citypages.com/databank/26/1279/article13395.asp City Pages]</ref>

[[Minneapolis]] is home to a few legendary record stores, [[Oar Folkjokeopus]] (now known as Treehouse Records) and the [[Electric Fetus]], as well as other stores such as [[Cheapo]].

=== Venues ===
[[Image:First Avenue-Minneapolis-2005-05-18.jpg|thumb|[[First Avenue]] nightclub]]
Large venues frequently hosting widely popular national music acts in Minnesota include the [[Target Center]], [[Xcel Energy Center]], and, more rarely due to poor [[acoustics]], the [[Metrodome]].  

The most influential small musical venue in the state is [[First Avenue]], a nightclub that initially opened (as ''The Depot'') in 1970; it was soon renamed ''Uncle Sam's'', and became a franchise of the [[American Events Company]], before finally becoming ''First Avenue'' in 1978.  It's central location in the heart of downtown on 1st Avenue and historic value of launching renown acts such as [[Prince, musician|Prince]] solidifies its importance in the current local scene and in Minnesota music history.<ref>Scholtes, Peter. "First Love." City Pages. September 3, 2003. http://www.citypages.com/databank/24/1187/article11480.asp</ref><ref>[http://www.first-ave.com/ First Avenue (homepage)]; <small>[http://www.minneapolis.com/nightlife/index.shtml Minneapolis Music and Nightlife]</ref>

The Twin Cities is also home to older traditional theaters of less than 2,000 capacity including [[The Historic Orpheum Theatre]], [[Pantages Theatre (Minneapolis)|Pantages Theatre]], and [[http://www.hennepintheatredistrict.org/history/state/ State Theatre]], all in the Hennepin Theatre District.  There is also a mix of modern clubs and simple bar and stage venues which generally host local acts. In Minneapolis these include the Fine Line Music Cafe, 400 Bar, the [[Triple Rock Social Club]], [[Theater in Minnesota|Varsity Theater]], Foundation, Acadia Cafe, and the Uptown Bar. In St. Paul these include Station 4 and the [[Turf Club (venue)|Turf Club]]. Just outside of St. Paul in [[Maplewood, Minnesota|Maplewood]] there are The Rock, and [[Myth Nightclub]].

In 1990, Prince opened The Quest (then under a different name) in downtown's Warehouse District and the club built a reputation of booking the best local and national acts, competing directly with First Avenue. With a string of misfortunes in the early 2000s, it closed indefinitely by 2007.<ref>Anderson Jr., G.R. "RIP: The Quest club." City Pages. January 12, 2007. http://blogs.citypages.com/blotter/2007/01/rip_the_quest_nightclub.php</ref>

Venues generally exclusive to classical, choral, vocal and acoustic music or productions include [[Orchestra Hall, Minneapolis|Orchestra Hall]], the [[Basilica of St. Mary]], [[Ted Mann|Ted Mann Concert Hall]], [[Ordway Center for the Performing Arts|Ordway Center]] and the [[Fitzgerald Theater]], a major music and theater venue owned by [[Minnesota Public Radio]]. The [[Dakota Jazz Club]] on [[Nicollet Mall]] offers the region's best jazz. Along with collegiate music, choral and opera productions, [[Northrop Auditorium]] on the [[University of Minnesota]] campus sometimes hosts up and coming national acts to appeal to a college-aged crowd but has a limited capacity of less than 5,000. 

The region also contains youth music venues, many of which operate as youth centers by day. These include the [[THE GARAGE]] in [[Burnsville, Minnesota|Burnsville]], [[http://www.thedepotcoffeehouse.com The Depot Coffee House]] in [[Hopkins, Minnesota|Hopkins]], Enigma Teen Center in [[Shakopee, Minnesota|Shakopee]], and on some occasions the [[Apple Valley, Minnesota|Apple Valley Teen Center]].  Also, a few venues catering to all ages crowds, now gone, are remembered as significant to the Twin Cities music scene. These include the Foxfire Coffee Lounge in downtown Minneapolis and the Fireball Espresso Cafe in Falcon Heights, St. Paul. 

Outside of the Minneapolis-St. Paul region, important local venues include [[Chisholm, Minnesota|Chisholm]]'s [[Ironworld U.S.A.]], which hosts major country stars, [[Ralph's Corner]], which closed in 2005 but was for many years one of the premier indie rock clubs in the Fargo-Moorhead area.<ref>Byron, pg. 111 <small>Byron calls Ironworld a "theme park of iron-ore mining and European immigrant cultures"</ref>

Defunct but historically important venues include the former cinema, the [[Pence Opera House]], [[Perpich Center for Arts Education]], NorShor Theater ([[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]) and the [[Prom Ballroom]], which showed many prominent jazz, rock and other bands in the mid-20th century.

== Education ==
[[Music education]] is part of the curriculum at Minnesota public schools.  All students take music at the [[elementary school|elementary]] and [[middle school]] ages, and many choose to take it as an elective in high school, where schools often organize [[marching band]]s, [[choir|chorus]]es or other performance opportunities.  The [[Perpich Center for Arts Education]] is a school of choice which draws students from all over the state and has an extensive modern and classical music education program. [[Higher education]] in music is an important part of the programs at several of Minnesota's [[university|universities]], including the [[University of Minnesota]], which offers the Bachelors of Music degree in music education, [[music therapy|therapy]] or performance, and graduate degrees in education, [[conducting]] and [[musicology]].<ref>[http://www.music.umn.edu/ University of Minnesota: School of Music]</ref> [[McNally Smith College of Music]], a preeminent college of contemporary music based in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], offers Bachelors of Music in music [[performance]] and [[music business]], as well as Associates Degrees and diploma programs in [[recording technology]].

Elementary school music education introduces elements of music like [[melody]], [[rhythm]] and [[harmony]], and examines the music of a "variety of cultures and historical times".  Students are expected to perform simply melodies and rhythms and perform songs and on instruments, and to use [[musical notation]].  Older students are exposed to more complex forms of music, and more scholarly approaches to music education.  Middle school students further learn about "the connection between a work of music, its purpose, and its cultural and historical contexts" and comparisons between music and other art forms.  Students also perform and listen to music, and are expected to evaluate performances using personal feelings and objective criteria.  At the high school level, performance, critical and scholarly expectations are higher and more complex, and may require participation in extracurricular programs like a school band or chorus.<ref>[http://www.mmea.org/PDFs/ArtsStandards2003.pdf Arts standards in 2003]</ref>

== History ==
[[Image:ApolloClub.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Apollo Club's 1889 cast of ''Romeo and Juliet'']]

Music in Minnesota extends prior to historical documentation, with the [[Native American music|music of the Native Americans]] of the area.  The [[Dakota music]]al traditions of what is now Minnesota are generally based around vocal, percussive and dance music; folk songs among the Dakota can be celebratory, martial or ceremonial.<ref>[http://www.mpls.lib.mn.us/history/ae1.asp A History of Minneapolis: Music]</ref> European settlers to Minnesota brought their own tradition of folk and classical music, especially choral and Christian-themed music, opera, and various kinds of ethnic folk music, most prominently including Scandinavian styles.  Traditional dance music is based mostly around [[schottisch]]es, [[polka]]s and [[waltz]]es with instrumentation including [[fiddle]], [[button-box]], [[mandola]], [[accordion]] and [[banjo]].<ref>[http://www.musicoutfitters.com/artists/larson.htm Leroy Larson and the Scandinavian Music Ensemble]</ref>

The first singing school in Minnesota was in St. Anthony (now part of Minneapolis), opened in 1851.  Later in the century, the Plymouth Congregational Church of Minneapolis began a singing group in 1857, followed by the first such club for women only, the Lorelei Club (later the ''Ladies' Thursday Musical Chorus''), in 1892.<ref>[http://www.mpls.lib.mn.us/history/ae1.asp A History of Minneapolis: Music]</ref>

[[Image:MacPhail.jpg|thumb|left|200px|1920 image from the [[MacPhail Center for Music]] yearbook]]
Thousands of [[Norwegian people|Norwegians]] settled in Minnesota between 1825 and 1925. Subcultures formed based around village of origin (''bygde''), and then formed organizations to maintain their home dialect and musical traditions. These organizations held annual meetings (''stevne'') which featured folk dancing, singing, fiddling and poetry. In the late 1860s, male choirs with primarily Norwegian and Swedish singers formed in cities and Lutheran colleges in Minnesota. These choirs sang a variety of popular and patriotic songs, hymns and folk tunes. In the 1880s, these choirs inspired the organization of singing societies that sponsored music festivals; the largest of these singing societies is the [[Norwegian Singers Association of America]] and the [[Union of Scandinavian Singers]].<ref name="Garland"/>

The end of the 19th century also saw the foundation of two long-running music groups, the [[Thursday Musical Chorus]] and the [[Apollo Men's Musical Group]].  Two of the most important Minnesota institutions were founded in the early 20th century, namely the MacPhail School of Violin (1907, later becoming the [[MacPhail Center for Music]]) and the [[Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra]] (1903, later the [[Minnesota Orchestra]]).<ref>[http://www.mpls.lib.mn.us/history/ae1.asp A History of Minneapolis: Music]</ref>

Minneapolis became a home for [[vaudeville]], especially Scandinavian-American vaudeville. This field was known as ''bondkomik'' (Norwegian) or ''bondkomiker'' (Swedish), and featured multi-act plays, dances, songs and monologues. Vaudeville shows usually ended with social dancing. Minneapolis' most famous performers were the [[Olson sisters]], [[Hjalmar Peterson]] and Ernest and Clarence Iverson ([[Slim Jim & the Vagabond Kid]]). After World War 1, Scandinavian musical pride diminished, a process accelerated by economic decline in the 1930s; rural and regional dance music slowly died out and became largely unknown.  During this era, however, the ''[[Leikarring]]'' movement began, which celebrated national Norwegian folk dance and song through musical societies like Minnesota's ''Norrona Leikarring''.<ref name="Garland"/>  

Around the time of [[World War II]], the [[Andrews Sisters]] from Minneapolis were very popular.  Today they are perhaps best known for the song "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy," which was [[cover version|covered]] by [[Bette Midler]] decades later.  There was also a thriving [[jazz]] scene at the time of the war.  Local [[radio]] host [[Leigh Kamman]] is linked to jazz in Minnesota, as he has now been covering it for more than sixty years.  The oldest recording studio in the state, [[Kay Banks]], was established in 1955 by [[Bruce Swedien]], a recording engineer, using the building of the [[Garrick Theatre]].<ref>[http://citypages.com/databank/26/1279/article13395.asp City Pages]</ref>

== Folk music ==
[[Image:Polka-Nyes-20061014.jpg|thumb|Ruth Adams and ''The World's Most Dangerous Polka Band'', Nye's Polonaise]]
Minnesota is home to many ethnic groups, but the state's folk music is best known in the areas of [[music of Sweden|Swedish]], [[music of Finland|Finnish]] and [[music of Norway|Norwegian musics]].  These ethnic communities frequently settled near each other, in Minnesota and in Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, North Dakota and South Dakota, and their musical and cultural identities grew blurred.  Norwegians and Swedes very frequently lived near each other in Minnesota, for example, and their music merged into a perceived Scandinavian identity, rather than uniquely Swedish or Norwegian. Their music is perceived as ''[[old-time music]]'', and is also influenced by the area's German, Irish, English, Polish and other Northern and Central European musics.<ref name="Garland"/>
 
Norwegian folk dance (''bygdedanser'') includes participatory social dances and performance dances like ''springar'', ''springdans'', ''pols'', ''rull'' and ''halling''. The Norwegian ''[[gammeldans]]'' tradition continues in ethnic communities in Minnesota, where [[two-step]]s, [[waltz]]es, [[polka]]s, [[schottische]]s and [[mazurka]]s are know as ''[[old-time music]]''.  Vocal music includes short poetic songs called ''stev'', [[emigrant ballad]]s which expressed nostalgia for Norway and express hope, despair and loss about life in the United States.  Musical accompaniment includes the [[accordion]], [[violin]], [[guitar]], [[bass guitar]], [[piano]], [[harmonica]], [[organ (musical instrument)|organ]], [[banjo]] and [[mandolin]].  The Norwegian [[Hardanger fiddle]], or ''hardingfele'', tradition has been played at weddings and taverns in Minnesota.<ref name="Garland"/>

== Modern music ==
[[Image:Copenhagen-Dylan-band-20070402.jpg|thumb|[[Bob Dylan]] and his band, 2007]]
[[Image:Prince.jpg|thumb|[[Prince (musician)|Prince]]]]
Minnesotan musicians from all genres have gained notoriety over the years, with the singing [[The Andrews Sisters|Andrews Sisters]] gaining worldwide prominence during World War II.  The modern music scene includes [[rock (music)|rock]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[electronic music]], and is especially known for [[punk rock]] and [[hardcore punk|hardcore]].  Prior to the evolution of punk in the 1970s, there was little rock and roll tradition from Minneapolis, which author Steven Blush attributed to a lack of anything to "rebel against", noting that it was Minneapolis' friendly atmosphere that made future hardcore punk musicians "crazy and rebellious"<ref>Blush, pg. 224 <small>''Prior to Punk, Minneapolis provided little fodder for the music industry.  No Rock & Roll tradition existed.  Maybe there was nothing to rebel against.  Life in friendly places tends to make kids crazy and rebellious.  Thus, Mpls cultivated its own brand of alienation and self-loathing.'' (sic)</small></ref> The first rock band from Minneapolis to achieve national prominence was the [[surf rock]] group [[The Trashmen]] who formed in 1962 and had a hit two years later with "Surfin' Bird".  That song, along with [[Dave Dudley]]'s "Six Days on the Road", helped to establish the [[Kay Banks]] studio, which would go on to record bands like [[The Guess Who]] and would become known for a distinctive sound characterized by three-track recording and the use of echo effects.  [[Dove (recording studio)|Dove Studios]] was another prominent studio in the 60s, known for releasing a series of psychedelic and garage rock singles that have become collector's items, including [[Calico Wall]]'s "Flight Reaction" and [[The Litter]]'s ''Distortions''.<ref>[http://citypages.com/databank/26/1279/article13395.asp City Pages]</ref>

Bob Dylan, a [[Hibbing, Minnesota|Hibbing]] native, became the first major mainstream solo star from Minnesota in the 1960s, known for his unique lyricism and [[folk-rock]] style.  He spent a brief period in Minneapolis, attending the University of Minnesota, where he played free shows on the West Bank of the [[University of Minnesota]] Minneapolis campus.  He was associated with [[Dinkytown]], the local center for young fans of folk music, where he listened to a wide variety of folk and blues.  The city's local folk scene produced a few well-known performers in the 1960s, besides Dylan, who spent much of his early career based out New York; these include the guitarist [[Leo Kottke]] and the trio [[Koerner, Ray & Glover]].  Folk music continues to be a major part of the Minnesota music scene, and is broadcast by the ''[[Prairie Home Companion]]'', a radio show hosted by author [[Garrison Keillor]]; the [[Red House Records|Red House]] record label is the most influential local label, and releases records by [[Peter Ostroushko]] and [[Greg Brown (folk musician)|Greg Brown]], among others.<ref>Unterberger, pg. 326</ref>

These influences contributed to the rise of [[punk music|punk]] rockers [[H<U+00FC>sker D<U+00FC>]], [[Soul Asylum]], [[the Replacements]], and the [[rhythm and blues]] stylings of [[The Time (band)|Morris Day and the Time]] and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] in the 1980s.<ref name="Compass">{{cite book | last = Breining | first = Greg | title = Compass American Guides: Minnesota, 3rd Edition | edition = 3rd  |publisher = [[Fodor's|Compass American Guides]] | year = 2005 | month = December | id = ISBN 1-4000-1484-0 }}</ref> R&B mega-producing team [[Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis]] have origins in the Twin Cities, and jazz musician [[Lester Young]] lived there for a time in his youth. 
 
These later sources brought the Minneapolis music scene to national attention; the period from about 1977 to 1987 was a period of incredible dynamism in the Minneapolis music scene, with offshoots in the punk scene including Soul Asylum, [[Babes in Toyland (band)|Babes in Toyland]], the Clams and many other seminal favorites, while Prince's immense power in the industry (which peaked during this period) created a rhythm and blues mini-empire at his [[Paisley Park Studios]], based in suburban [[Chanhassen, Minnesota|Chanhassen]].

Contemporary local artists continue to enjoy critical acclaim such as [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] duo [[Atmosphere (music group)|Atmosphere]] and frontman [[Slug (rapper)|Slug]]'s label [[Rhymesayers Entertainment]], the smaller [[Doomtree]], and  commercially successful pop-rockers [[Semisonic]]. While things have slowed considerably, the Twin Cities are still the region's musical hotbed. More recently, the music scene has showed signs of revival with the success of the Minneapolis-based rock bands [[Motion City Soundtrack]], [[Tapes 'n Tapes]], and [[Quietdrive]]. The area has also shown an unusual affinity for certain artists. For instance, while largely unnoticed on their home turf in New York City, the Twin Cities accounted for the majority of national sales for [[Soul Coughing]]'s second album ''[[Irresistible Bliss]]'' during its first eight weeks of release; this followed from the fledgling fan base that Soul Coughing found here while touring for their first effort, ''[[Ruby Vroom]]''. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

=== R&B ===
{{main|Minneapolis sound}}

Minneapolis became noted as a center for R&B in the 1980s, when the singing star [[Prince Rogers Nelson|Prince]] rose to fame. The city had little history in African American popular music, like R&B, until Prince debuted in 1978. He became the first architect of the ''Minneapolis sound'', a [[funk]] and [[disco]]-influenced style of R&B, and inspired a legion of subsequent performers, including [[The Time]], [[Wendy & Lisa]] and [[Vanity Six]].<ref>Unterberger, pgs. 323<U+2013>325</ref>

In 1980, a group of session musicians, recording as [[Lipps Inc.]], recorded the song "Funkytown" at [[Sound 80 Studios]].  The song launched the [[record production]] careers of [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]], whose [[Flyte Tyme Productions]] helped define the Minneapolis sound. The pair's first big break was [[Janet Jackson]]'s ''[[Control (Janet Jackson album)|Control]]'' in 1986, which launched her career and spawned numerous projects between Jam and Lewis with artists as varied as [[Mint Condition]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Sounds of Blackness]], [[New Edition]], [[Alexander O'Neal]], [[Cherrelle]], [[The S.O.S. Band]], [[Boyz II Men]]  [[Patti LaBelle]], and many others.<ref>Unterberger, pgs. 325<U+2013>326</ref>

=== Rock ===
In the mid-1970s, the local music scene in the Minneapolis area began producing popular and innovative acts.  Many signed to major record labels, and by the mid 1980s, had achieved national prominence. The first may have been [[Lipps Inc]], who gained some popularity in the late 1970s during the [[disco]] era with the global hit "[[Funkytown]]" (though the song itself was not in the rock genre).  [[The Suburbs]] also formed around the same time.  They were the first group to be released under the local [[Twin/Tone Records]] label in 1978.  Largely only known locally, the group developed a [[New Wave music|New Wave]] sound in the 1980s and opened for national acts such as [[Iggy Pop]] and [[The B-52's]].

Originally based out of [[Jay's Longhorn Bar]], the [[Minneapolis hardcore|Minneapolis hardcore punk]] scene grew slowly.  [[The Suicide Commandos]] were perhaps first, and they were quickly followed by [[H<U+00FC>sker D<U+00FC>]] and [[The Replacements]], who started as [[hardcore punk]] bands and became pivotal in the development of [[alternative rock]]. The Replacements eventually achieved some limited mainstream success, while H<U+00FC>sker D<U+00FC> became the first hardcore outfit to sign to a major label. [[Soul Asylum]] was originally a Minneapolis hardcore band called Loud Fast Rules, which played with bands like [[Man Sized Action]], [[Rifle Sport]] and [[Breaking Circus]] who mixed [[funk]], [[thrash metal]] and other influences.<ref>Blush, pg. 224</ref> The Twin Cities rock scene had fully come to national prominence by 1984, when the ''[[Village Voice]]'''s renowned critics poll, Pazz and Jop, named three Minneapolis recordings among the top ten of the year: Prince's ''[[Purple Rain]]'', The Replacements' ''[[Let It Be (Replacements album)|Let It Be]]'', and H<U+00FC>sker D<U+00FC>'s ''[[Zen Arcade]]''.<ref>[http://www.mnhs.org/collections/mplsmusic/index.htm Minnesota Historical Society] <small>''Purple Rain'' was at #2, ''Let It Be'' was at #4 and ''Zen Arcade'' at #8.''</ref>

The late 1980s saw new sounds coming out of the state, when [[Information Society]] came to the attention of [[nightclub]]s and record labels in [[New York, New York|New York City]].  The group had formed in 1982 at [[Macalester College]] in St. Paul and made an initial release on the local Wide Angle Records label two years later.  "What's on Your Mind (Pure Energy)" became a huge hit in 1988, and they continued to make music through most of the 1990s.  Beginning in 1986, [[The Jayhawks]] began recording, achieving critical acclaim with a modern [[folk-rock]] sound.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:tyeq97l7krat~T1 Allmusic.com: Jayhawks]</ref>

Another group to form around the same time was [[Babes in Toyland (band)|Babes in Toyland]], an early [[riot grrl]] band that saw moderate popularity through the 1990s as well.  They toured with [[Lollapalooza]] in 1993.  Many groups of the 1980s and 1990s eventually split up, and a number of other bands formed from the remnants.  [[Bob Mould]] left H<U+00FC>sker D<U+00FC> to head [[Sugar (band)|Sugar]] and do solo projects.  [[Trip Shakespeare]] eventually transformed into [[Semisonic]], who gained popularity in the late 1990s.  A former member of Semisonic met up with another from Trip Shakespeare to form [[The Flops]].

=== Hip hop ===

{{main|Twin Cities Hip Hop}}

The Twin Cities region is home to a thriving [[underground hip hop]] scene due largely to the presence of [[Rhymesayers Entertainment]]. Rhymesayers artists including, among others, [[Eyedea & Abilities]], [[Brother Ali]], [[Los Nativos]], [[Musab]], and, most notably, [[Atmosphere (music group)|Atmosphere]], began to receive national attention in recent years.  [[Heiruspecs]] is another notable group.  Also recently, the Twin Cities [[hip hop music|hip hop]] scene owes some of its success to the annual [[Twin Cities Celebration of Hip Hop]] founded by Larry Lucio, Jr. & [[Toki Wright]] and sponsored by [[YO! The Movement]], as well as D.U. Nation's [http://www.dunation.com website]. The next most respectable hip-hop crew of the Twin Cities is [[Doomtree]].  The Twin Cities scene is unique as most crews have a friendly relationship and perform many shows together. Doomtree includes such artists as; [[P.O.S.]], [[Doomtree|Sims]], [[Doomtree|Turbo Nemesis]], and [[Doomtree|Lazerbeak]].  There are many other hip hop crews in the Twin Cities.

===Techno/Dance===
Minnesota is home to a burgeoning [[electronic music]] scene in the area, though the genre tends to get little radio airplay in the state.  Dance music in Minnesota is often played on local [[pirate radio]] outlets.  The most famous of these was Beat Radio 97.7, started by area programmer and DJ [[Alan Freed (XM Radio)|Alan Freed]] (not to be confused with the [[Alan Freed]] who was an early promoter of [[rock and roll]]).  After his transmitter was shut down by the [[Federal Communications Commission]], Freed brought the music to special programs on several local stations, including during most of 1998 with night-long broadcasts on the former [[Radio Aahs]] network, which reached 10 cities around the country.  He now programs dance stations of [[XM Satellite Radio]].
