Durrani's father, Mohammed Zaman Khan, was chief of the [[Durrani|Abdalis]] [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]]. He was killed in a battle with the [[Hotaki dynasty|Hotakis]] between 1722 and 1723, around the time of Ahmad Khan's birth. His family were from the [[Sadozai (Pastun tribe)|Sadozai]] section of the [[Popalzai]] clan of the Abdalis. In 1729, after the invasion of [[Nader Shah]], the young Ahmad Khan fled with his family south to Kandahar and took refuge with the [[Ghilzai]]s.<ref>Fall of the Mughal Empire, Volume 1, by Sir Jadunath Sarkar (1964), p. 124</ref> He and his brother, Zulfikar, were later imprisoned inside a fortress by [[Hussain Hotaki]], the Ghilzai ruler of southern Afghanistan. Shah Hussain commanded a powerful tribe of Pashtun fighters, having conquered the eastern part of Persia in 1722 with his brother [[Mahmud Hotaki|Mahmud]], and trodden the throne of the Persian [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]].

In around 1731, Nader Shah Afshar, the rising new ruler of Persia, began enlisting the Abdali Pashtuns from Herat in his army. After [[Siege of Kandahar|conquering Kandahar]] in 1738, Ahmad Khan and his brother were freed by Nader Shah and provided with leading careers in his administration. The Ghilzais were pushed eastward while the Abdalis began to re-settle in and around the city of Kandahar.<ref name=EofI>C. Collin-Davies (1999). "Ahmad Shah Durrani".

==Commander in the Afsharid military==
{{See|Afsharid dynasty}}
[[File:A Nawab of Awadh, Lucknow, India. 19th century.jpg|thumb|300px|Delegation of [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharids]] negotiating with a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Nawab]].]]
Nader Shah favored Abdali not only because he came from a well respected noble Afghan family but also due to his handsome features as well as both being Khorasanians. Ahmad Khan proved himself in Nader Shah's service and was promoted from a personal attendant (''yas<U+0101>wal'') to command a cavalry of Abdali tribesmen. He quickly rose to command a cavalry contingent estimated at four thousand strong,<ref name="Griffiths">Griffiths, John. C (2001) Afghanistan: A History of Conflict p12</ref> composed chiefly of Abdalis, in the service of the Shah on his [[Nader Shah#Invasion of India|invasion of India]].

Popular history has it that the brilliant but megalomaniac Nader Shah could see the talent in his young commander. Later on, according to Pashtun legend, it is said that in Delhi Nader Shah summoned Ahmad Shah, and said, "Come forward Ahmad Abdali. Remember Ahmad Khan Abdali, that after me the Kingship will pass on to you.<ref name="Singer">Singer, Andre (1983) Lords of the Khyber. The story of the North West Frontier</ref> "Nader Shah used to say in admiration that he had not met in Iran, Turan, and Hindustan any man of such laudable talents as Ahmad Abdali possessed."<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=4_SB95ZA-_cC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA81#v=onepage&q&f=false Decisive Battles India Lost (326 B. C. to 1803 A. D.)]'', by Jaywant D. Joglekar, pg. 81. Lulu.com, 2006. ISBN 1-8472-8302-0</ref>

Nader Shah's rule abruptly ended in June 1747 when he was assassinated by his own guards. The guards involved in the assassination did so secretly so as to prevent the Abdalis from coming to their King's rescue. However, Ahmad Khan was told that Nader Shah had been killed by one of his wives. Despite the danger of being attacked, the Abdali contingent led by Ahmad Khan rushed either to save Nader Shah or to confirm what happened. Upon reaching the King's tent, they were only to see Nader Shah's body and severed head. Having served him so loyally, the Abdalis wept at having failed their leader,<ref>[[Olaf Caroe]], ''The Pathans'' (1981 reprint)</ref> and headed back to Kandahar. On their way back to Kandahar, the Abdalis had decided that Ahmad Khan would be their new leader, and already began calling him as ''Ahmad Shah''.<ref name="EofI"/>

At the time of Nadir's death, he commanded a contingent of Abdali Pashtuns. Realizing that his life was in jeopardy if he stayed among the Persians who had murdered Nadir Shah, he decided to leave the Persian camp, and with his 4,000 troops he proceeded to Qandahar. Along the way and by sheer luck, they managed to capture a caravan with booty from India. He and his troops were rich; moreover, they were experienced fighters. In short, they formed a formidable force of young Pashtun soldiers who were loyal to their high-ranking leader.<ref name="Vogelsang"/>}}

==Rise to power==
{{Further|Durrani dynasty}}
[[File:Coronation of Ahmad Shah Durrani in 1747 by Breshna.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Coronation]] of Ahmad Shah Durrani in 1747 by a 20th century Afghan artist, Breshna.]]
In October 1747, the chiefs of the Abdali tribes met near Kandahar for a [[Loya Jirga]] to choose a leader. For nine days serious discussions were held among the candidates in the Argah. Ahmad Shah kept silent by not campaigning for himself. At last Sabir Shah, a religious figure from the area, came out of his sanctuary and stood before those in the Jirga and said, "He found no one worthy for leadership except Ahmah Shah. He is the most trustworthy and talented for the job. He had Sabir's blessing for the nomination because only his shoulders could carry this responsibility". The leaders and everyone agreed unanimously. Ahmad Shah was chosen to lead the Afghan tribes. Coins where struck after his coronation as King occurred near the tomb of Shaikh Surkh, adjacent to Nader Abad Fort.

Despite being younger than other claimants, Ahmad Shah had several overriding factors in his favour:
* He was a direct descendant of Sado, patriarch of the Sadozai clan, the most prominent tribe amongst the Pashtuns at the time;
* He was unquestionably a charismatic leader and seasoned warrior who had at his disposal a trained, mobile force of several thousand cavalrymen;
* Haji Ajmal Khan, the chief of the [[Mohammedzai]]s (also known as [[Barakzai]]s) which were rivals of the Sadodzais, already withdrew out of the election<ref name="EofI"/>

One of Ahmad Shah's first acts as chief was to adopt the title ''Padshah durr-i dawran'' ('King, "pearl of the age").<ref name="LoC"/>

==Forming the last Afghan empire==
{{See|Durrani Empire}}
[[File:Afghan royal soldiers of the Durrani Empire.jpg|thumb|150px|Afghan royal soldiers of the [[Durrani Empire]] (also referred to as the Afghan Empire).]]
Following his predecessor, Ahmad Shah Durrani set up a special force closest to him consisting mostly of his fellow Durranis and other Pashtuns, as well as [[Tajik people|Tajiks]], [[Qizilbash]] and others.<ref name="EofI"/> Durrani began his military conquest by capturing [[Ghazni]] from the Ghilzais and then wresting [[Kabul]] from the local ruler, and thus strengthened his hold over eastern Khorasan which is most of present-day Afghanistan. Leadership of the various Afghan tribes rested mainly on the ability to provide booty for the clan, and Durrani proved remarkably successful in providing both booty and occupation for his followers. Apart from invading the [[Punjab region]] three times between the years 1747<U+2013>1753, he captured [[Herat]] in 1750 and both [[Nishapur]] (Neysh<U+0101>b<U+016B>r) and [[Mashhad]] in 1751.

Durrani first crossed the [[Indus River]] in 1748, the year after his ascension <U+2013> his forces sacked and absorbed [[Lahore]] during that expedition. The following year (1749), the Mughal ruler was induced to cede [[Sindh]] and all of the Punjab including the vital trans Indus River to him, in order to save his capital from being attacked by the Afghan forces of the Durrani Empire. Having thus gained substantial territories to the east without a fight, Ahmad Shah and his Afghan forces turned westward to take possession of Herat, which was ruled by Nader Shah's grandson, [[Shah Rukh of Persia]]. The city fell to Ahmad Shah in 1750, after almost a year of siege and bloody conflict; Ahmad Shah and his forces then pushed on into present-day [[Iran]], capturing Nishapur and Mashhad in 1751. He then pardoned Shah Rukh and reconstituted Khorasan, but a tributary of the Durrani Empire. This marked the westernmost border of the Durrani Empire as set by the [[Pul-i-Abrisham]], on the Mashhad-Tehran road.<ref name="Sykes">Sykes, Percy (2008)''A History of Persia'' READ books. ISBN 978-1-4437-2408-1</ref>

Meanwhile, in the preceding three years, the [[Sikh]]s had occupied the city of Lahore, and Ahmad Shah had to return in 1751 to oust them. In 1752, Ahmad Shah with his forces invaded and reduced [[Kashmir]]. He next sent an army to subdue the areas north of the [[Hindu Kush]]. In short order, the powerful army brought under its control the [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]], Tajik and [[Hazara people]]s of northern, central, and western Afghanistan. In 1752, Kashmiri nobles invited Ahmad Shah Durrani to invade the province and oust the ineffectual Mughal rulers.

Then in 1756-57, in what was his fourth invasion of India, Ahmad Shah sacked [[Delhi]] and plundered [[Agra]], [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], and [[Vrndavana]]. However, he did not displace the Mughal dynasty, which remained in nominal control as long as the ruler acknowledged Ahmad's suzerainty over the Punjab, Sindh, and Kashmir. He installed a puppet emperor, [[Alamgir II]], on the Mughal throne, and arranged marriages for himself and his son [[Timur Shah Durrani|Timur]] into the imperial family that same year. He married the daughter of the Mughal emperor [[Muhammad Shah]]. His de facto suzerainity was accepted by the [[East India Company]].<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-2TH8UYeAaoC&lpg=PA170&ots=Q207U6gF1K&dq=Ahmad%20Shah%20Bangash&pg=PA57#v=onepage&q=Panipat&f=false The rise of the Indo-Afghan empire, c.1710-1780 By Jos J. L. Gommans]</ref> Leaving his second son Timur Shah (who was wed to the daughter of (Alamgir II) to safeguard his interests, Durrani finally left India to return to Afghanistan.

On his way back he attacked the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]] in [[Amritsar]] and filled its sacred pool with the blood of slaughtered cows. Durrani captured Amritsar in 1757, and sacked the [[Harmandir Sahib]] at which point the famous [[Baba Deep Singh]] and some of his loyalists were killed by the Afghans.<ref name=deol>{{cite book

===Third battle of Panipat===
{{Main|Battle of Panipat (1761)}}
[[File:The Third battle of Panipat 13 January 1761.jpg|thumb|250px|Durrani sitting on a brown horse during the [[Battle of Panipat (1761)|1761 Battle of Panipat]] in [[Northern India]].]]
The Mughal power in northern India had been declining since the reign of [[Aurangzeb]], who died in 1707. In 1751<U+2013>52, the ''Ahamdiya'' treaty was signed between the Marathas and Mughals, when [[Balaji Bajirao]] was the [[Peshwa]].<ref name="Panipat">Patil, Vishwas. ''Panipat''.</ref> Through this treaty, the Marathas controlled virtually the whole of India from their capital at [[Pune]] and Mughal rule was restricted only to Delhi(Mughals remained the nominal heads of Delhi). Marathas were now straining to expand their area of control towards the Northwest of India. Ahmad Shah sacked the Mughal capital and withdrew with the booty he coveted. To counter the Afghans, Peshwa [[Balaji Bajirao]] sent Raghunathrao. He succeeded in ousting Timur Shah and his court from India and brought Lahore, Multan, Kashmir and other subahs on the Indian side of Attock under Maratha rule.<ref name="K. RoyIHB">{{cite book | last=Roy |first=Kaushik |title=India's Historic Battles: From Alexander the Great to Kargil |publisher=Permanent Black, India |pages=80<U+2013>1 |isbn=978-81-7824-109-8}}</ref> Thus, upon his return to Kandahar in 1757, Amidst appeals from Muslim leaders like [[Shah Waliullah]],<ref>[http://storyofpakistan.com/person.asp?perid=P064 Shah Wali Ullah 1703-1762]</ref> Ahmad Shah chose to return to India and confront the Maratha Confederacy.

He declared a [[jihad]] ([[Islam]]ic holy war) against the [[Maratha]]s, and warriors from various Pashtun tribes, as well as other tribes such as the Baloch, Tajiks, and Muslims from South Asia answered his call. Early skirmishes ended in victory for the Afghans against the smaller Maratha garrisons in northwest India. By 1759, Durrani and his army had reached Lahore and were poised to confront the Marathas. By 1760, the Maratha groups had coalesced into a big enough army under the command of [[Sadashivrao Bhau]]. Once again, [[Panipat]] was the scene of a battle for control of [[northern India]]. The [[Third battle of Panipat]] (January 1761), fought between largely [[Islam|Muslim]] armies of Abdali and Nawabs and largely [[Hinduism|Hindu]] Maratha army was waged along a twelve-kilometre front, and resulted in a decisive victory for Ahmad Shah.<ref>for a detailed account of the battle fought see Chapter VI of The Fall of the Moghul Empire of Hindustan by H.G.

===East Turkistan and the Uyghurs===
{{See|Kashgar#Qing_Reconquest}}
Plagued by the plight of the [[Uyghurs]] whose lands were conquered by the warring [[Qing]] dynasty, Ahmad Shah laboriously attempted to rally Muslim nations to check Qing expansion.<ref>Holy War in China, By Ho-dong Kim, pg. 20</ref> Ahmad Shah halted trade with Qing China and dispatched troops to [[Kokand]].<ref>L. J. Newby ''The Empire and the Khanate''p34</ref> However, with his campaigns in India exhausting the state treasury, and with his troops stretched thin throughout Central Asia, Ahmad Shah did not have enough resources to check Qing forces. In an effort to alleviate the situation in [[East Turkistan]], Ahmad Shah sent envoys to [[Beijing]], but the talks did not yield favorable prospects for the Uyghurs.<ref>John K. Fairbank(1968) ''China and Central Asia, 1368-1884 In The Chinese World Order'' pp. 206<U+2013>224, 337<U+2013>68. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press.</ref>

===Rise of the Sikhs in the Punjab===
During the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] between [[Marathas]] and Ahmad Shah, The Sikhs did not support either side and decided to sitback and see what would happen. The exception was Ala Singh of [[Patiala]], who sided with the Afghans and was actually being granted and crowned the first Sikh Maharajah at the Sikh holy temple.<ref>{{cite book |title=Rise of the Sikh power|last=Sinha|first=Narendra Krishna|coauthors=|origyear=1973|year=2008|publisher=University of Michigan|chapter=Ala Singh |location= |page=37}}</ref>

The victory at Panipat was the high point of Ahmad Shah's and Afghan power, this situation was not to last long; the empire soon began to unravel. As early as by the end of 1761, the Sikhs had begun to rebel in much of the Punjab. In 1762, Ahmad Shah crossed the passes from Afghanistan for the sixth time to crush the Sikhs. He assaulted Lahore and Amritsar. Within two years, the Sikhs rebelled again, and he launched another campaign against them in 1764, resulting in an even battle. During his 8th invasion of India, the Sikhs vacated Lahore, but faced Abdali's army and general, Jahan Khan. The fear of his Indian territory falling to the Sikhs continued to obsess the Durrani's mind and he let out another campaign against Sikhs towards the close of 1766, which was his eighth invasion into India.

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Mosque in Kandahar.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[mausoleum]] of Ahmad Shah Durrani in [[Kandahar|Kandahar City]], which also serves as the [[Friday Mosque]] and contains the [[Shrine of the Cloak|sacred cloak]] that [[Islamic Prophet]] [[Muhammad]] wore.]]
Ahmad Shah Durrani died in 1772-73 in Kandahar Province. He was buried at a spot in Kandahar City, where a large mausoleum was built. It has been described in the following way:
{{quote|Under the shimmering turquoise dome that dominates the sand-blown city of Kandahar lies the body of Ahmad Shah Abdali, the young Kandahari warrior who in 1747 became the region's first Durrani king. The mausoleum is covered in deep blue and white tiles behind a small grove of trees, one of which is said to cure toothache, and is a place of pilgrimage. In front of it is a small mosque with a marble vault containing one of the holiest relics in the Islamic World, a ''kherqa'', the Sacred Cloak of Prophet Mohammed that was given to Ahmad Shah by [[Mir Muhammad Murad Beg|Mured Beg]], the Emir of [[Bokhara]]. The Sacred Cloak is kept locked away, taken out only at times of great crisis but the mausoleum is open and there is a constant line of men leaving their sandals at the door and shuffling through to marvel at the surprisingly long marble tomb and touch the glass case containing Ahmad Shah's brass helmet. Before leaving they bend to kiss a length of pink velvet said to be from his robe. It bears the unmistakable scent of jasmine.<ref>Lamb, Christina (2002). ''The Sewing Circles of Herat''.

In his tomb his epitaph is written:
{{quote|<poem>
The King of high rank, Ahmad Shah Durrani,
Was equal to [[Khosrau I|Kisra]] in managing the affairs of his government.
In his time, from the awe of his glory and greatness,
The lioness nourished the stag with her milk.
From all sides in the ear of his enemies there arrived
A thousand reproofs from the tongue of his dagger.
The date of his departure for the house of mortality
Was the year of the Hijra 1186 (1772&nbsp;A.D.)<ref name="Dupree">[[Nancy Hatch Dupree]] <U+2013> An Historical Guide To Afghanistan <U+2013> ''The South (Chapter 16)''</ref></poem>}}

Ahmad Shah's victory over the Marathas influenced the history of the subcontinent and, in particular, [[United Kingdom|British]] policy in the region. His refusal to continue his campaigns deeper into India prevented a clash with the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] and allowed them to continue to acquire power and influence after their acquisition of [[Bengal]] in 1757. However, fear of another Afghan invasion was to haunt British policy for almost half a century after the [[Battle of Panipat (1761)|battle of Panipat]]. The acknowledgment of Abdali's military accomplishments is reflected in a British intelligence report on the Battle of Panipat, which referred to Ahmad Shah as the 'King of Kings'.<ref name="British library">[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelpregion/asia/afghanistan/afghanistancollection/afghansources/sources1747to1809.html "Afghanistan 1747-1809: Sources in the India Office Records"]</ref> This fear led in 1798 to a British envoy being sent to the Persian court in part to instigate the Persians in their claims on Herat to forestall an Afghan invasion of British India.<ref name="British library"/> [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]] wrote of Ahmad Shah:
{{quote|His military courage and activity are spoken of with admiration, both by his own subjects and the nations with whom he was engaged, either in wars or alliances. He seems to have been naturally disposed to mildness and clemency and though it is impossible to acquire sovereign power and perhaps, in Asia, to maintain it, without crimes; yet the memory of no eastern prince is stained with fewer acts of cruelty and injustice.|[[Mountstuart Elphinstone]]}}

His successors, beginning with his son [[Timur Shah Durrani|Timur]] and ending with [[Shuja Shah Durrani]], proved largely incapable of governing the last Afghan empire and faced with advancing enemies on all sides. Much of the territory conquered by Ahmad Shah fell to others by the end of the 19th century. They not only lost the outlying territories but also alienated some [[Pashtun tribes]] and those of other Durrani lineages. Until [[Dost Mohammad Khan]]'s ascendancy in 1826, chaos reigned in Afghanistan, which effectively ceased to exist as a single entity, disintegrating into a fragmented collection of small countries or units. This policy ensured that he did not continue on the path of other conquerors like [[Babur]] or [[Muhammad of Ghor]] and make India the base for his empire.

In Pakistan, a [[short-range ballistic missile]] [[Abdali-I]], is named in the honour of Ahmed Shah Abdali.<ref>http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/GI03Df02.html</ref>

==Ahmad Shah's poetry==
Ahmad Shah wrote a collection of [[ode]]s in his native [[Pashto language]]. He was also the author of several poems in [[Persian language|Persian]]. The most famous Pashto poem he wrote was ''Love of a Nation'':{{quote|<poem>
By blood, we are immersed in love of you.
The youth lose their heads for your sake.
I come to you and my heart finds rest.
Away from you, grief clings to my heart like a snake.
I forget the throne of [[Delhi]]
when I remember the mountain tops of my Afghan land.
If I must choose between the world and you,
I shall not hesitate to claim your barren deserts as my own.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.afghan-web.com/culture/poetry/poems.html# |title=Ahmad Shah Durrani (Pashto Poet)|work=Abdullah Qazi|publisher=Afghanistan Online|accessdate=2010-09-23| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100908224421/http://www.afghan-web.com/culture/poetry/poems.html| archivedate= 8 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://maic.jmu.edu/journal/8.1/features/kim/kim.htm |title=A Profile of Afghanistan - Ahmad Shah Durrani (Pashto Poet)| work=Kimberly Kim |publisher=[[Mine Action Information Center]]|accessdate=2010-09-23}}</ref></poem>}}
