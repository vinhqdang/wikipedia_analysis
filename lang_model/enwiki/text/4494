The '''Vezina Trophy''' is awarded annually to the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[goaltender]] who is "adjudged to be the best at this position".<ref name="Vezina history"/> At the end of each season, the 30 [[List of NHL General Managers|General Managers]] of the teams in the [[National Hockey League]] vote to determine the goaltender who was the most valuable to his team during the regular season.

==History==
[[Image:Turk Broda.jpg|left|thumb|[[Turk Broda]] with the Vezina Trophy in 1948.]]
The Vezina Trophy was named in honour of [[Georges V<U+00E9>zina]], an exceptional goaltender with the [[Montreal Canadiens]], who collapsed during a game in [[1925-26 NHL season|1925]] and was diagnosed as having [[tuberculosis]]. Upon Vezina's death, the trophy was donated to the League by the Canadiens former owners, [[Leo Dandurand]], Louis Letourneau and Joe Cattarinichthe. It was first awarded at the end of the [[1926-27 NHL season]].<ref name="Vezina history">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/trophies/vezina.html|title=Vezina Trophy history|accessdate=2007-08-17|publisher=NHL.com}}</ref>  

Until the [[1980-81 NHL season|1980-81 season]], the trophy was awarded to the goaltender(s) of the team allowing the fewest number of goals during the [[regular season]].<ref name="Vezina history"/> However, it was recognized that this system often meant the trophy went to the goaltender of the better team rather than the individual. and hence the change was made to offer the [[William M. Jennings Trophy]] to the goaltender(s) playing for the team with the fewest goals against. Since 1981, the Vezina Trophy has been awarded by the NHL General Managers to the most outstanding goaltender. [[Billy Smith]] of the [[New York Islanders]] was the first winner of the Vezina under the current system.<ref name="Vezina history3">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/silver_splashvezina.htm|title=Vezina Trophy history|accessdate=2007-08-17|publisher=LegendsofHockey.net}}</ref>  

[[Jacques Plante]] holds the record for winning the most Vezinas with seven, trailed by [[Bill Durnan]] and [[Dominik Hasek]] both of who have won six. Hasek has won the most under the current system of honouring the best individual goalie. Players for the [[Montreal Canadiens]] have won the Vezina 28 times.<ref name="Vezina history2">{{cite web|url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008355|title=Vezina Trophy history|accessdate=2007-08-17|publisher=canadianencyclopedia.com}}</ref>

Under the original definition, there would often be multiple winners from the same team during one season. In the [[1973-74 NHL season]], [[Tony Esposito]] of the [[Chicago Black Hawks]] and [[Bernie Parent]] of the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] finished tied for the fewest goals against, the only time that there would be a tie between two players from different teams.<ref name="Vezina history"/>

There are only three players that have won both the Vezina and [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] for the same season: Jacques Plante, who won both trophies for the [[1961-62 NHL season|1961-62 season]]; Dominik Hasek who won both for the [[1996-97 NHL season|1996-97]] and [[1997-98 NHL season|1997-98]] seasons; and [[ Jose Theodore]], who won the Vezina and Hart for the [[2001-02 NHL season]]. Two other Vezina winning goaltenders have also won the Hart Memorial Trophy: [[Roy Worters]] and [[Al Rollins]]. [[Chuck Rayner]] was the only goaltender to the Hart Memorial Trophy, but never the Vezina.<ref name="Hart history">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/trophies/hart.html|title=Hart Memorial Trophy history|accessdate=2007-08-17|publisher=NHL.com}}</ref>

The voting is conducted at the end of the regular season by the 30 [[List of NHL General Managers|general managers]] of the teams in the [[National Hockey League]], and each individual voter ranks their top five candidates on a 5-3-1 points system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/jon_dolezar/news/2003/04/01/dolie_insider/|title=Foppa shows the most Hart|accessdate=2007-08-17|date=[[2003-04-20]]|author=Jon Dolezar |publisher=SI.com}}</ref> Three finalists are named and the trophy is awarded at the NHL Awards ceremony after the playoffs.
