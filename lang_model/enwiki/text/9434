The '''Imperial Japanese Navy''' ('''IJN''') ([[Ky<U+016B>jitai|{{unicode|Ky<U+016B>jitai}}]]: <U+5927><U+65E5><U+672C><U+5E1D><U+570B><U+6D77><U+8ECD> [[Shinjitai]]: <U+5927><U+65E5><U+672C><U+5E1D><U+56FD><U+6D77><U+8ECD> ''{{Audio|ja-Dai-Nippon_teikoku_kaigun.ogg|Dai-Nippon Teikoku Kaigun}}'' or <U+65E5><U+672C><U+6D77><U+8ECD> ''Nippon Kaigun''), officially '''Navy of the Greater Japanese Empire''', also known as the '''Japanese Navy''' was the [[navy]] of the [[Empire of Japan]] from 1869 until 1947, when it was dissolved following Japan's constitutional [[Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan|renunciation of the use of force]] as a means of settling international disputes. It was the third largest navy in the world by 1920 behind the [[United States Navy]] and [[Royal Navy]],<ref>Evans, Kaigun</ref>. It was supported by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] for aircraft and airstrike operation from the fleet. It was a major force in the [[Pacific War]].

The origins of the Imperial Japanese Navy trace back to early interactions with nations on the [[Asia|Asian continent]], beginning in the early [[history of Japan#Feudal Japan|medieval period]] and reaching a peak of activity during the 16th and 17th centuries at a time of [[cultural diffusion|cultural exchange]] with [[Europe]]an [[power (international)|powers]] during the [[Age of Discovery]]. After two centuries of stagnation during the country's ensuing [[Sakoku|seclusion policy]] under the [[shogun]]s of the [[Edo period]], Japan's navy was comparatively backward when the country was forced open to trade by [[Convention of Kanagawa|American intervention]] in 1854. This eventually led to the [[Meiji Restoration]]. Accompanying the re-ascendance of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] came a period of frantic [[modernization]] and [[industrialization]]. The navy's history of successes, sometimes against much more powerful foes as in the 1895 [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese war]] and the 1905 [[Russo-Japanese War]], ended in almost complete annihilation during the concluding days of [[World War II]]. The IJN was officially dissolved in 1947.

==Origins==
{{main|Naval history of Japan}}
[[Image:DanNoUra.jpg|thumb|Naval battle of [[Battle of Dan-no-ura|Dan-no-Ura]] in 1185]]

Japan has a long history of naval interaction with the Asian continent, involving transportation of troops between [[Korea]] and Japan, starting at least with the beginning of the [[Kofun era|Kofun period]] in the 3rd century.

Following the attempts at [[Mongol invasions of Japan]] by [[Kublai Khan|Kubilai Khan]] in 1274 and 1281, Japanese [[Wokou|''wak<U+014D>'']] became very active in [[plunder]]ing the coast of the [[History of China#The Chinese Empire|Chinese Empire]].

[[Image:RedSealShip.JPG|thumb|left|A 1634 Japanese [[Red seal ship]], combining eastern and western naval technologies]]

[[Japan]] undertook major naval building efforts in the 16th century, during the [[Sengoku period|Warring States period]], when feudal rulers vying for supremacy built vast coastal navies of several hundred ships. Around that time, Japan may have developed one of the first [[Ironclad warship|ironclad]] warships, when [[Oda Nobunaga]], a [[Japan]]ese [[daimyo]], had six iron-covered [[Atakebune|Oatakebune]] made in 1576.<ref>''THE FIRST IRONCLADS'' In Japanese: [http://s-mizoe.hp.infoseek.co.jp/m160.html], [http://www12.plala.or.jp/k-hakuyo/index_ship/ship_9/3000.htm]. Also in English: [http://www.samurai-archives.com/mth.html]: ''"Iron clad ships, however, were not new to Japan and Hideyoshi; [[Oda Nobunaga]], in fact, had many iron clad ships in his fleet."'' (referring to the anteriority of Japanese ironclads (1578) to the Korean [[Turtle ship]]s (1592)). In Western sources, Japanese ironclads are described in CR Boxer "The Christian Century in Japan 1549&ndash;1650", p122, quoting the account of the Italian Jesuit Organtino visiting Japan in 1578. Nobunaga's ironclad fleet is also described in "A History of Japan, 1334&ndash;1615", Georges Samson, p309 ISBN 0-8047-0525-9. Korea's "ironclad Turtle ships" were invented by Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]], and are first documented in 1592. Incidentally, Korea's iron plates only covered the roof (to prevent intrusion), and not the sides of their ships. The first Western ironclads date to 1859 with the French [[FS La Gloire (1858-1883)|''Gloire'']] ("Steam, Steel and Shellfire").</ref> In 1588, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] issued a ban on Wak<U+014D> piracy; the pirates then became vassals of Hideyoshi, and comprised the naval force used in the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592-1598)|Japanese invasion of Korea]]. It has been stated Admiral Yi built the first combat ironclad seabound, to wreak havoc on the Japanese supply ships during the Imjin Waeran War of 1592<U+2013>97.

Japan built her first large ocean-going warships in the beginning of the 17th century, following contacts with the Western nations during the [[Nanban trade period]]. In 1613, the Daimyo of [[Sendai, Miyagi|Sendai]], in agreement with the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] [[Shogun|Bakufu]], built [[Japanese warship San Juan Bautista|''Date Maru'']], a 500 ton [[galleon]]-type ship that transported the Japanese embassy of [[Hasekura Tsunenaga]] to the Americas, which then continued to Europe. From 1604, about 350 [[Red seal ship]]s, usually armed and incorporating some Western technologies, were also commissioned by the Bakufu, mainly for [[Southeast Asia]]n trade.

===Seclusion and Western studies===
[[Image:ShoheiMaru.JPG|thumb|[[Japanese warship Shohei Maru|''Sh<U+014D>hei Maru'']] (1854) was built from Dutch technical drawings.]]

Beginning in 1640, for more than 200 years Japan chose "''[[sakoku]]''" (seclusion), which forbade contacts with the West, eradicated [[Christianity]], and prohibited the construction of ocean-going ships on pain of death. Contacts were maintained through the Dutch enclave of [[Dejima]] however, allowing for the transfer of a vast amount of knowledge related to the Western technological and [[scientific revolution]]. This study of Western sciences, called "''[[rangaku]]''", also allowed Japan to remain updated in areas relevant to naval sciences, such as [[cartography]], [[optics]] or mechanical sciences. The full study of Western [[shipbuilding]] techniques resumed in the 1840s during the [[Late Tokugawa shogunate]] (''Bakumatsu'').

===Early modernization of the Shogunal Navy===
In 1853 and 1854, [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] Commodore [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Matthew Perry]] made a demonstration of force with the newest steam warships of the U.S. Navy. Perry finally obtained the opening of the country to international trade through the 1854 [[Convention of Kanagawa]]. This was soon followed by the 1858 "[[Unequal Treaties|unequal]]" [[U.S.-Japan Treaty of Amity and Commerce]], which allowed the establishment of foreign concessions, extra-territoriality for foreigners, and minimal import taxes for foreign goods.

[[Image:Kanrinmaru.jpg|thumb|[[Japanese warship Kanrin Maru|''Kanrin Maru'']], Japan's first screw-driven steam warship, 1857]]

As soon as Japan agreed to open up to foreign influence, the Tokugawa shogun government initiated an active policy of assimilation of Western naval technologies. In 1855, with Dutch assistance, the Shogunate acquired its first steam warship, ''Kank<U+014D> Maru'', which was used for training, and established the [[Nagasaki Naval Training Center]]. In 1857, it acquired its first screw-driven steam warship, the [[Japanese warship Kanrin Maru|''Kanrin Maru'']]. In 1859, the Naval Training Center was transferred to [[Tsukiji]] in [[Tokyo]]. Naval students were sent to study in Western naval schools for several years, such as the future Admiral [[Enomoto Takeaki|Takeaki Enomoto]] (who studied in the [[Netherlands]] from 1862&ndash;1867), starting a tradition of foreign-educated future leaders such as Admirals [[Togo Heihachiro|Heihachiro Togo]] and, later, [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]. 

[[Image:Chiyodagata.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Japan's first domestically-built steam warship, the 1863 [[Japanese gunboat Chiyodagata|''Chiyodagata'']].]]

As early as 1863, less than 10 years after opening the country to foreign interaction, Japan completed her first domestically-built steam warship, [[Japanese gunboat Chiyodagata|''Chiyodagata'']]. In 1865, the French naval engineer [[L<U+00E9>once Verny]] was hired to build Japan's first modern naval arsenals, at [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka]] and [[Nagasaki]]. In 1867<U+2013>1868, a British Naval mission headed by [[Tracey Mission|Captain Tracey]]<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/ijn-rise.htm Source]</ref> was sent to Japan to assist the development of the Navy and organize the naval school of Tsukiji.<ref>Described in "Soie et Lumiere", in a parallel to the [[French Military Mission to Japan (1867-1868)]] for the Army.</ref>

[[Image:Stonewall-Kotetsu.jpg|thumb|''[[Kotetsu]]'' (ex-CSS ''Stonewall''), Japan's first modern [[Ironclad warship|ironclad]], 1869]]

By the end of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1867, the Tokugawa navy was already the largest of Eastern Asia, organized around eight Western-style steam warships and the flagship [[Japanese battleship Kaiy<U+014D> Maru|''Kaiy<U+014D> Maru'']], which were used against pro-imperial forces during the [[Boshin War]], under the command of Admiral Enomoto. The conflict culminated with the [[Naval Battle of Hakodate]] in 1869, Japan's first large-scale modern naval battle, and ended with the defeat of the last Tokugawa forces and the restoration of Imperial rule. The revolutionary French-built ironclad ''Kotetsu'', originally ordered by the Tokugawa shogunate, was received by the Imperial side and was used decisively towards the end of the conflict.

==Creation of the Imperial Japanese Navy (1869)==
[[Image:DaiNipponTeikokuKaigun.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Chinese characters|Kanji]] for "Imperial Japanese Navy"]]

From 1868, the restored [[Emperor Meiji|Meiji Emperor]] continued with reforms to industrialize and militarize Japan to prevent the United States and European powers from overwhelming her. On [[17 January]] [[1868]], the Ministry of Military Affairs (<U+5175><U+90E8><U+7701>, also known as the Army-Navy Ministry) was established, with [[Iwakura Tomomi]], [[Shimazu Tadayoshi]] and [[Prince Komatsu Akihito|Prince Komatsu-no-miya Akihito]] as the First Secretaries.

[[Image:Japanese Ironclad warship Ryujo.jpg|thumb||The British-built [[Japanese battleship Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D> (1864)|''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'']] was the flagship of the Imperial Japanese Navy until 1881.]]

On [[26 March]] [[1868]], the first Naval Review was held in Japan (in [[Osaka Bay]]), with 6 ships from the private domainal navies of [[Saga]], [[Ch<U+014D>sh<U+016B>]], [[Satsuma han|Satsuma]], [[Kurume]], [[Kumamoto]] and [[Hiroshima]] participating. The total tonnage of these ships was 2252 tons, which was far smaller than the tonnage of the single foreign vessel (from the French Navy) that also participated. The following year, in July 1869, the Imperial Japanese Navy was formally established, two months after the last combat of the Boshin War. 

In July 1869, the private domanial navies were abolished, and their 11 ships were added to the 7 surviving vessels of the defunct Tokugawa ''bakufu'' navy to form the core of the new Imperial Japanese Navy. In February 1872, the Ministry of Military Affairs was replaced by a separate Army Ministry (<U+9678><U+8ECD><U+7701>) and Navy Ministry (<U+6D77><U+8ECD><U+7701>). In October 1873, [[Katsu Kaishu]] became Navy Minister. The new government drafted an ambitious plan to create a Navy with 200 ships organized into 10 fleets. It was abandoned within a year due to lack of resources. 

===British support===

During the 1870s and 1880s, the Imperial Japanese Navy remained an essentially coastal defense force, although the Meiji government continued to modernize it. ''[[Jho Sho Maru]]'' (soon renamed ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D> Maru'') commissioned by [[Thomas Glover]] was launched at [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]] on [[March 27]], [[1869]]. In 1870, an Imperial decree determined that [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s [[Royal Navy]] should be the model for development, instead of the [[Netherlands]].<ref>"Togo Heihachiro", II</ref> 

From September 1870, the English Lieutenant Horse, a former gunnery instructor for the [[Saga Prefecture|Saga fief]] during the [[Bakumatsu]] period, was put in charge of gunnery practice onboard the ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>''.<ref>"Togo Heiachiro", I7</ref> In 1871, the Ministry resolved to send 16 trainees abroad for training in naval sciences (14 to Great Britain, 2 to the United States), among which was [[Togo Heihachiro]].<ref>"Togo Heihachiro", II</ref> A 34-member British naval mission visited Japan in 1873 for two years, headed by Comdr. [[Archibald Lucius Douglas|Archibald Douglas]].<ref>"Togo Heihachiro", II</ref> Later, Comdr. [[L.P. Willan]] was hired in 1879 to train naval cadets.

===First interventions abroad (Taiwan 1874, Korea 1875<U+2013>76)===
[[Image:GanghwaLanding.jpg|thumb|The landing of the Japanese [[marines]] from the [[Japanese gunboat Unyo|''Unyo'']] at [[Ganghwa Island]], Korea, in the 1875 [[Ganghwa Island incident]].]]
[[Image:KanfadoKantai.jpg|thumb|The Imperial Japanese Navy, in [[Pusan]], on its way to [[Ganghwa Island]] (<U+6C5F><U+83EF><U+5CF6>), [[Korea]], January 16th, 1876. There were 2 warships (''Nisshin'', ''[[Japanese warship Moshun|Moshun]]''), 3 troop transports, and one liner for the embassy led by [[Kuroda Kiyotaka]].]] 

During 1873, a plan to invade the [[Korean peninsula]] (the [[Seikanron]] proposal made by [[Saigo Takamori]]) was narrowly abandoned by decision of the central government in Tokyo. In 1874, the [[Taiwan Expedition of 1874|Taiwan expedition]] was the first foray abroad of the new Imperial Japanese Navy and the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. 

Various interventions in the Korean peninsula continued in 1875<U+2013>1876, starting with the [[Ganghwa Island incident]] (<U+6C5F><U+83EF><U+5CF6><U+4E8B><U+4EF6>) provoked by the Japanese gunboat [[Japanese gunboat Unyo|''Unyo'']], leading to the dispatch of a large force of the Imperial Japanese Navy. As a result, the [[Treaty of Ganghwa]] was signed, marking the official opening of Korea to foreign trade, and Japan's first example of Western-style interventionism and adoption of "unequal treaties" tactics. 

Soon, however domestic rebellions, the [[Saga Rebellion]] (1874) and especially the [[Satsuma Rebellion]] (1877), forced the government to focus on land warfare. Naval policy, expressed by the slogan ''Shusei Kokub<U+014D>'' (Jp:<U+5B88><U+52E2><U+56FD><U+9632>, lit. "Static Defense"), focused on coastal defenses and a standing army (established with the assistance of the second [[French Military Mission to Japan (1872-1880)|French Military Mission to Japan]]), and a coastal Navy, leading to a military organization under the ''Rikushu Kaij<U+016B>'' (Jp:<U+9678><U+4E3B><U+6D77><U+5F93>, Army first, Navy second) principle.

In 1878, the Japanese cruiser Seiki sailed to Europe with an entirely Japanese crew.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/ijn-rise.htm Source]</ref>

===Further modernization (1870s)===
Ships such as the [[Japanese ironclad warship Fus<U+014D>|''Fus<U+014D>'']], [[Japanese corvette Kong<U+014D> (1877)|''Kong<U+014D>'' (1877)]] and the [[Japanese corvette Hiei (1877)|''Hiei'' (1877)]] were built in British shipyards specifically for the Imperial Japanese Navy. Private construction companies such as [[Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries|Ishikawajima]] and [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.|Kawasaki]] also emerged around this time.

[[Image:Kongo(1878).jpg|thumb|Armoured [[corvette]] [[Japanese corvette Kong<U+014D> (1877)|''Kong<U+014D>'' (1877)]].]]
In 1883 two large warships were ordered from British shipyards. [[Japanese cruiser Naniwa|''Naniwa'']] and the [[Japanese cruiser Takachiho|''Takachiho'']] were 3,650-ton ships. They were capable of speeds up to 18&nbsp;knots (33&nbsp;km/h) and were armed with 2 to 3-inch deck armor and two 10.2-in (260&nbsp;mm) [[Krupp]] guns. The naval architect Sas<U+014D> Sach<U+016B> designed these on the line of the [[Elswick]] class of [[protected cruisers]] but with superior specifications. An [[arms race]] was taking place with [[China]] however, who equipped herself with two German-built [[battleship]]s of 7,335 tons ([[Chinese turret ship Dingyuan|''Ting Y<U+00FC>an'']] and [[Chinese turret ship Zhenyuan|''Chen-Y<U+00FC>an'']]). Unable to confront the Chinese fleet with only two modern cruisers, Japan resorted to French assistance to build a large, modern fleet which could prevail in the upcoming conflict.

===Influence of the French "Jeune Ecole" (1880s)===
[[Image:Matsushima(Bertin).jpg|thumb|The French-built ''Matsushima'', flagship of the Imperial Japanese Navy at the [[Battle of Yalu River (1894)|Battle of Yalu River]] (1894).]]

During the 1880s, France took the lead in influence, due to its "[[Jeune Ecole]]" ("young school") doctrine, favoring small, fast warships, especially [[Cruiser (warship)|cruiser]]s and  [[torpedo boat]]s, against bigger units. The choice of France may also have been influenced by the Minister of the Japanese Navy (<U+6D77><U+8ECD><U+537F>), who happened to be [[Enomoto Takeaki]] at that time (Navy Minister 1880<U+2013>1885), a former ally of the French during the Boshin War.

The ''Meiji'' government issued its First Naval Expansion bill in 1882, requiring the construction of 48 warships, of which 22 were to be torpedo boats. The naval successes of the [[French Navy]] against China in the [[Sino-French War]] of 1883<U+2013>85 seemed to validate the potential of torpedo boats, an approach which was also attractive to the limited resources of Japan. In 1885, the new Navy slogan became ''Kaikoku Nippon'' (Jp:<U+6D77><U+56FD><U+65E5><U+672C>, lit. "Maritime Japan").

In 1885, the leading French Navy engineer [[Louis-Emile Bertin|Emile Bertin]] was hired for four years to reinforce the Japanese Navy and to direct the construction of the arsenals of [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]] and [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]]. He developed the ''Sanseikan'' class of cruisers; 3 units featuring a single powerful main gun, the 12.6in (320 mm) [[Canet gun]]. Altogether, Bertin supervised the building of more than twenty units. They helped establish the first true modern naval force of Japan. It allowed Japan to achieve mastery in the building of large units, since some of the ships were imported, and some others were built domestically at the arsenal of [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka]]:

[[Image:CanetGun.jpg|thumb|The 12.6in [[Canet gun]] aboard ''Matsushima''.]]
* 3 cruisers: the 4,700 ton [[Japanese cruiser Matsushima|''Matsushima'']] and [[Japanese cruiser Itsukushima|''Itsukushima'']], built in France, and the [[Japanese cruiser Hashidate|''Hashidate'']], built at Yokosuka.
* 3 coastal warships of 4,278 tons.
* 2 small cruisers: the [[Japanese cruiser Chiyoda|''Chiyoda'']], a small cruiser of 2,439 tons built in Britain, and the [[Japanese cruiser Yaeyama|''Yaeyama'']], 1800 tons, built at Yokosuka.
* 1 [[frigate]], the 1600 ton [[Japanese warship Takao|''Takao'']], built at Yokosuka.
* 1 [[destroyer]]: the 726 ton [[Japanese warship Chishima|''Chishima'']], built in France.
* 16 torpedo boats of 54 tons each, built in France by the [[Companie du Creusot]] in 1888, and assembled in Japan.

This period also allowed Japan "to embrace the revolutionary new technologies embodied in [[torpedo]]es, torpedo-boats and [[Naval mine|mines]], of which the French at the time were probably the world's best exponents".<ref> Howe, p.281</ref> Japan acquired its first torpedoes in 1884, and established a "Torpedo Training Center" at Yokosuka in 1886.

These ships, ordered during the fiscal years 1885 and 1886, were the last major orders placed with France. The unexplained sinking  of [[Japanese cruiser Unebi|''Unebi'']] ''en route'' from France to Japan in December 1886, created diplomatic frictions and doubts about the French designs.

===British shipbuilding===
[[Image:Kotaka.jpg|thumb|The torpedo boat [[Japanese warship Kotaka|''Kotaka'']] (1887)]]

Japan turned again to Britain, with the order of a revolutionary torpedo boat, ''Kotaka'' (considered the first ever effective design of a destroyer),<ref>Peattie & Evans, ''Kaigun'', p.17</ref> in 1887 and with the purchase of [[Japanese cruiser Yoshino|''Yoshino]], built at the [[Armstrong Whitworth|Armstrong]] works in [[Elswick]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], the fastest cruiser in the world at the time of her launch in 1892.<ref>''ibid.''</ref> In 1889, she ordered the [[River Clyde|Clyde-built]] [[Japanese cruiser Chiyoda|''Chiyoda'']], which defined the type for [[armored cruiser]]s.<ref name="milanovich">''Chiyoda (II): First Armoured Cruiser of the Imperial Japanese Navy'', Kathrin Milanovich, Warship 2006, Conway Maritime Press, 2006, ISBN 1-01844-86030-2</ref>

After 1882 (until 1918, with the visit of the [[French Military Mission to Japan (1918-1919)|French Military Mission to Japan]]), the Imperial Japanese Navy stopped relying on foreign instructors altogether. In 1886, she manufactured her own [[brown powder|prismatic powder]], and in 1892 one of her officers invented a powerful explosive, the [[Shimose powder]].<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/ijn-rise.htm Source]</ref>

==Sino-Japanese War (1894<U+2013>1895)==
{{main|First Sino-Japanese War}}
[[Image:Weihaiwei surrender.jpg|right|thumb|Chinese forces, with their foreign advisors, surrendering to Admiral [[Itoh Sukeyuki]] at the [[Battle of Weihaiwei]].]]

Japan continued the modernization of its navy, especially as China was also building a powerful modern fleet with foreign, especially German, assistance, and the pressure was building between the two countries to take control of [[Korea]]. The [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese war]] was officially declared on [[August 1]], [[1894]], though some naval fighting had already taken place.

[[Image:NisshinBattle.jpg|thumb|left|Video footage of a naval battle during the first Sino-Japanese war<ref>Video footage of the Sino-Japanese war: [http://www2.open.ed.jp/real/15655/01.mp2 Video (external link)]. {{multi-video start}}
{{multi-video item|filename=Naval battle.ogg|title=IJN Naval battle|description=Video footage of a naval battle during the [[First Sino-Japanese war]] (1894)|format=[[Theora]]}}
{{multi-video end}}
</ref>]]

The Japanese navy devastated Qing's [[Beiyang Fleet]] off the mouth of the [[Yalu River]] at the [[Battle of Yalu River (1894)|Battle of Yalu River]] on [[September 17]] [[1894]], in which the Chinese fleet lost 8 out of 12 warships. Although Japan turned out victorious, the two large German-made battleships of the Chinese Navy remained almost impervious to Japanese guns, highlighting the need for bigger capital ships in the Japanese Navy ([[Chinese turret ship Dingyuan|''Ting Yuan'']] was finally sunk by torpedoes, and [[Chinese turret ship Zhenyuan|''Chen-Yuan'']] was captured with little damage). The next step of the Imperial Japanese Navy's expansion would thus involve a combination of heavily armed large warships, with smaller and innovative offensive units permitting aggressive tactics.


As a result of the conflict, under the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] (April 17th, 1895), [[Taiwan]] and the [[Pescadores Islands]] were transferred to Japan. The Imperial Japanese Navy took possession of the island and quelled opposition movements between March to October 1895, and the islands continued to be a Japanese colony until 1945. Japan also obtained the [[Liaodong Peninsula]], although she was forced by Russia to return it to China, only to see Russia take possession of it soon after.

==Suppression of the Boxer rebellion (1900)==
[[Image:BoxerJapaneseMarines.jpg|thumb|Japanese marines serving under British commander [[Edward Hobart Seymour|Edward Seymour]] during the [[Boxer Rebellion]].]]
{{main|Boxer rebellion}}
The Imperial Japanese Navy further intervened in China in 1900, by participating together with Western Powers to the suppression of the Chinese [[Boxer Rebellion]]. The Navy supplied the largest number of warships (18 out of a total of 50) and delivered the largest contingent of troops among the intervening nations (20,840 Imperial Japanese Army and Navy soldiers, out of total of 54,000).

The conflict allowed Japan to combat together with Western nations, and to acquire first hand understanding of their fighting methods.

==Russo-Japanese War (1904<U+2013>1905)==
[[Image:ADMIRALTOGO.JPG|left|thumb|Admiral [[Togo Heihachiro]], age 58, at the time of the [[Russo-Japanese War]].]]

Following the Sino-Japanese War, and the humiliation of the forced return of the [[Liaodong Peninsula|Liaotung peninsula]] to [[China]] under [[Russia]]n pressure (the "[[Triple Intervention]]"), [[Japan]] began to build up its military strength in preparation for further confrontations.
Japan promulgated a ten-year naval build-up program, under the slogan "Perseverance and determination" (Jp:<U+81E5><U+85AA><U+5617><U+80C6>, Gashinsh<U+014D>tan), in which it commissioned 109 warships, for a total of 200,000 tons, and increased its Navy personnel from 15,100 to 40,800. The new fleet consisted of:

* 6 [[battleship]]s (all British-built)
* 8 [[armored cruiser]]s (4 British-, 2 Italian-, 1 German-built [[Japanese cruiser Yakumo|''Yakumo'']], and 1 French-built [[Japanese cruiser Azuma|''Azuma'']])
* 9 [[cruiser]]s (5 Japanese, 2 British and 2 U.S.-built)
* 24 [[destroyer]]s (16 British- and 8 Japanese-built)
* 63 [[torpedo boat]]s (26 German-, 10 British-, 17 French-, and 10 Japanese-built)

[[Image:JBMikasa.jpg|right|thumb|''Mikasa'', the most powerful battleship of her time, in 1905.]]

One of these battleships, [[Japanese battleship Mikasa|''Mikasa'']], the most advanced ship of her time,<ref>Evans ''Kaigun'', p.60<U+2013>61</ref> was ordered from the [[Vickers]] shipyard in the [[United Kingdom]] at the end of 1898, for delivery to Japan in 1902. Commercial shipbuilding in Japan was exhibited by construction of the twin screw steamer ''Aki-Maru'', built for [[Nippon Yusen Kaisha]] by the [[Mitsubishi]] Dockyard & Engine Works, [[Nagasaki]]. The Imperial Japanese cruiser [[Japanese cruiser Chitose|''Chitose'']] was built at the [[Union Iron Works]] in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].

These dispositions culminated with the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904&ndash;1905). At the [[Battle of Tsushima]], Admiral Togo aboard ''Mikasa'' led the combined Japanese fleet into the decisive engagement of the war.<ref>Corbett ''Maritime Operations in the Russo-Japanese War'', 2:333</ref> The Russian fleet was almost completely annihilated: out of 38 Russian ships, 21 were sunk, 7 captured, 6 disarmed, 4,545 Russian servicemen died and 6,106 were taken prisoner. On the other hand, the Japanese only lost 116 men and 3 torpedo boats. These victories broke Russian strength in [[East Asia]], and triggered waves of mutinies in the Russian Navy at [[Sevastopol]], [[Vladivostok]] and [[Kronstadt]], peaking in June with the [[Battleship Potemkin uprising|''Potemkin'' rising]], thereby contributing to the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]].

[[Image:Holland 1 Class Submarine in the IJN.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Philip Holland|Holland 1]]-class submarine, the first [[Imperial Japanese Navy submarines|Japanese navy submarine]], purchased during the Russo Japanese War.]]

During the Russo-Japanese war, Japan also made frantic efforts to develop and construct a fleet of submarines. Submarines had only recently become operational military engines, and were considered to be special weapons of considerable potential.
The Imperial Japanese Navy acquired its first submarines in 1905 from the United States [[Electric Boat Corporation|Electric Boat Company]], barely four years after the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] had commissioned its own first submarine, [[USS Holland (SS-1)|USS ''Holland'']]. The ships were [[John Philip Holland|Holland]] designs. They were shipped in kit to Japan and then assembled at the [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka]] Naval Yard, to become hulls ''No1'' through ''5'', and became operational at the end of 1905.

==Towards an autonomous national Navy==
[[Image:IJN Satsuma.jpg|thumb|''Satsuma'', the first ship in the world to be designed and laid down as an "[[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|all-big-gun]]" battleship]]

Japan continued in its efforts to build up a strong national naval industry. Following a strategy of "Copy, improve, innovate",<ref>Howe, p.284</ref> foreign ships of various designs were usually analysed in depth, their specifications often improved on, and then were purchased in pairs so as to organize comparative testing and improvements. Over the years, the importation of whole classes of ships was progressively substituted by local assembly, and then complete local production, starting with the smallest ships, such as torpedo boats and cruisers in the 1880s, to finish with whole battleships in the early 1900s. The last major purchase was in 1913 when the [[battlecruiser]] [[Japanese battleship Kong<U+014D>|''Kong<U+014D>'']] was purchased from the [[Vickers]] shipyard. By 1918, there was no aspect of shipbuilding technology where Japanese capabilities fell significantly below world standards.<ref>Howe, p.268</ref> By 1920, the Imperial Japanese Navy was the world's third largest navy, and was a leader in many aspects of naval development:

* The Japanese Navy was the first navy in the world to use [[wireless telegraphy]] in combat (following its 1897 invention by [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]]), at the 1905 Battle of Tsushima.<ref>Evans, ''Kaigun'', p.84</ref>
* In 1905, it began building the battleship [[Japanese battleship Satsuma|''Satsuma'']], at the time the largest warship in the world by displacement, and the first ship in the world to be designed, ordered and laid down as an "all-big-gun" battleship, about one year before [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']]. She was however finished afterwards and with mixed calibre guns due to a lack of 12 inch guns.<ref> Jane's ''Battleships of the 20th Century'', p.68</ref>
* Between 1905 and 1910, Japan started to build battleships domestically. The 1906 battleship ''Satsuma'' was built in Japan with about 80% parts from Britain, but the next battleship class, the 1910 [[Japanese battleship Kawachi|''Kawachi'']] was built with only 20% imported parts.

==World War I==
{{main|Asian and Pacific theatre of World War I}} {{main|Japan during World War I}}
Japan entered [[World War I]] on the side of the Allies, against [[Imperial Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], as a natural prolongation of the 1902 [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]]. 

[[Image:Wakamiya.jpg|thumb|The Japanese [[seaplane carrier]] [[Japanese seaplane carrier Wakamiya|''Wakamiya'']] conducted the world's first sea-launched air raids in September 1914.]]

In the [[Battle of Tsingtao]], the Japanese Navy seized the German naval base of [[Qingdao|Tsingtao]]. During the battle, beginning on [[September 5]], [[1914]], ''Wakamiya'' conducted the world's first sea-launched air strikes.<ref>Wakamiya is "credited with conducting the first successful carrier air raid in history"[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/index.html Source:GlobalSecurity.org]</ref> from [[Kiaochow Bay]].<ref>"Sabre et pinceau", Christian Polak, p92</ref> Four [[Maurice Farman]] seaplanes bombarded German land targets (communication centers and command centers) and damaged a German minelayer in the Tsingtao peninsula from September to [[November 6]] [[1914]] when the Germans surrendered.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/wakamiya-av.htm]</ref>

Concurrently, a battle group was sent to the central Pacific in August and September to pursue the [[German East Asiatic squadron]], which then moved into the Southern Atlantic, where it encountered British naval forces and was destroyed at the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]]. Japan seized former German possessions in [[Micronesia]] (the [[Mariana Islands]], excluding [[Guam]]); the [[Caroline Islands]]; and the [[Marshall Islands]]), which remained Japanese colonies until the end of World War II, under the [[League of Nations]]' [[South Pacific Mandate]].

Hard pressed in Europe, where she had only a narrow margin of superiority against [[Germany]], Britain had requested, but was denied, the loan of Japan's four newest ''Kong<U+014D>''-class battleships ([[Japanese battleship Kong<U+014D>|''Kong<U+014D>'']], [[Japanese battleship Hiei|''Hiei'']], [[Japanese battleship Haruna|''Haruna'']], and [[Japanese battleship Kirishima|''Kirishima'']]), the first ships in the world to be equipped with 14-inch (356&nbsp;mm) guns, and the most formidable capital ships in the world at the time.<ref>Peattie and Evans, ''Kaigun'', p.161</ref> The British 15-inch-gunned battleships would come into use during the war.

[[Image:NisshinMalta.jpg|thumb|Japanese armoured cruiser ''[[Japanese cruiser Nisshin|Nisshin]]'' in the [[Mediterranean]] ([[Malta]], 1919).]]

Following a further request to contribute to the conflict, and the advent of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] by Germany, the Imperial Navy in March 1917 sent a special force of destroyers to the Mediterranean. This force, consisting of one armoured cruiser, [[Japanese cruiser Akashi|''Akashi'']], as [[flotilla]] leader, and eight of the Navy's newest destroyers ([[Japanese destroyer Ume|''Ume'']], [[Japanese destroyer Kusunoki|''Kusunoki'']], [[Japanese destroyer Kaede|''Kaede'']], [[Japanese destroyer Katsura|''Katsura'']], [[Japanese destroyer Kashiwa|''Kashiwa'']], [[Japanese destroyer Matsu|''Matsu'']], [[Japanese destroyer Matsu|''Matsu'']], [[Japanese destroyer Sugi|''Sugi'']], and [[Japanese destroyer Sakaki|''Sakaki'']]), under Admiral Sat<U+014D> K<U+014D>z<U+014D>, was based in [[Malta]] and efficiently protected allied shipping between [[Marseille]], [[Taranto]], and ports in [[Egypt]] until the end of the War. In June, ''Akashi'' was replaced by [[Japanese cruiser Izumo|''Izumo'']], and four more destroyers were added (''Kashi'', ''Hinoki'', ''Momo'', and ''Yanagi''). They were later joined by the cruiser [[Japanese cruiser Nisshin|''Nisshin'']]. By the end of the war, the Japanese had escorted 788 allied transports. One destroyer, ''Sakaki'', was torpedoed by an Austrian submarine with the loss of 59 officers and men.  

In 1918, ships such as [[Japanese cruiser Azuma|''Azuma'']] were assigned to [[convoy]] escort in the [[Indian Ocean]] between [[Singapore]] and the [[Suez Canal]] as part of Japan<U+2019>s contribution to the war effort under the [[Anglo-Japanese alliance]].

After the conflict, the Japanese Navy received seven German submarines as spoils of war, which were brought to Japan and analysed, contributing greatly to the development of the Japanese submarine industry.<ref>Evans, ''Kaigun'', p212</ref>

==Interwar years==
In the years before [[World War II]] the IJN began to structure itself specifically to fight the United States. A long stretch of [[militarism|militaristic]] expansion and the start of the [[Second Sino-Japanese war]] in 1937 had alienated the United States, which was seen as a rival of Japan. 

[[Image:Japanese aircraft carrier Hosho.jpg|thumb|left|[[Japanese aircraft carrier Hosho|''Hosho'']], the first purpose-designed [[aircraft carrier]] in the world, completed (1922)]]

The Imperial Japanese Navy was faced, before and during World War II, with considerable challenges, probably more so than any other navy in the world.<ref>Lyon ''World War II warships'' p34</ref> Japan, like Britain, was almost entirely dependent on foreign resources to supply its economy. To achieve Japan<U+2019>s expansionist policies, IJN had to secure and protect distant sources of raw material (especially Southeast Asian oil and raw materials), controlled by foreign countries (Britain, France, and [[Netherlands#Naming conventions|the Netherlands]]). To achieve this goal, she had to build large warships capable of long range. 

This was in conflict with Japan's doctrine of "decisive battle" (<U+8266><U+968A><U+6C7A><U+6226>, ''[[Kantai Kessen]]'', which did not require long range),<ref>Peattie & Evans, ''Kaigun''.</ref> in which IJN would allow the U.S. to sail across the Pacific, using submarines to weaken it, then engage the U.S. Navy in a "decisive battle area", near Japan, after inflicting such [[attrition]].<ref>Miller, Edward S. ''War Plan Orange''. Annapolis, MD: United States Naval Institute Press, 1991.</ref> This is in keeping with the theory of [[Alfred T. Mahan]], to which every major navy subscribed before [[World War II]], in which wars would be decided by engagements between opposing surface fleets<ref>Mahan, Alfred T. ''Influence of Seapower on History, 1660<U+2013>1783''. Boston: Little, Brown.</ref> (as they had been for over 300 years). It was the basis for Japan's demand for a 70% ratio (10:10:7) at the [[Washington Naval Conference]], which would give Japan superiority in the "decisive battle area", and the U.S.'s insistence on a 60% ratio, which meant parity.<ref>Miller, ''op. cit.''</ref> Japan, unlike other navies, clung to it even after it had been demonstrated to be obsolete.

It was also in conflict with her past experience. Japan's numerical and industrial inferiority led her to seek technical superiority (fewer, but faster, more powerful ships), qualitative superiority (better training), and aggressive tactics (daring and speedy attacks overwhelming the enemy, a recipe for success in her previous conflicts). She failed to take account of the fact her opponents in the [[Pacific War]] did not face the political and geographical constraints of her previous wars, nor did she allow for losses in ships and crews.<ref>Peattie & Evans, ''op. cit.'', and Willmott, H. P.,''The Barrier and the Javelin''. Annapolis, MD: United States Naval Institute Press, 1983.</ref> 

During the interwar, Japan took the lead in many areas of warship development:
* In 1921 it launched the [[Japanese aircraft carrier H<U+014D>sh<U+014D>|''H<U+014D>sh<U+014D>'']], the first purpose-designed [[aircraft carrier]] in the world to be completed,<ref>"The Imperial Japanese Navy was a pioneer in naval aviation, having commissioned the world's first built-from-the-keel-up carrier, the ''Hosho''." [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/ijn.htm Source].</ref> and subsequently developed a fleet of aircraft carriers second to none.
* In keeping with its doctrine, the Imperial Navy was the first navy in the World to mount 14-in (356&nbsp;mm) guns (in ''[[Japanese battleship Kong<U+014D>|Kong<U+014D>]]''), 16-in (406&nbsp;mm) guns (in ''[[Japanese battleship Nagato|Nagato]]''), and the only Navy ever to mount [[18.1"/45|18.1-in (460&nbsp;mm) guns]] (in the ''[[Yamato class battleship|Yamato]]-class ships'').<ref>The British had used 18-inch guns during the First World War as experiments and then to arm monitors.</ref>
* In 1928, she launched the innovative ''[[Fubuki class destroyer|Fubuki]]''-class [[destroyer]], introducing enclosed dual 5-inch turrets capable of anti-aircraft fire. The new destroyer design was soon emulated by other navies. The ''Fubuki''s also featured the first [[torpedo tube]]s enclosed in [[splinter]]proof [[turret]]s.<ref>Fitzsimons, Bernard, ed. ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons and Warfare'' (London: Phoebus, 1978), Volum3 10, p.1041, "''Fubuki''".</ref>
* Japan developed the 24-inch (610&nbsp;mm) oxygen fuelled [[Type 93 torpedo|Type 93]] torpedo, generally recognized as the best torpedo in the world, to the end of World War II.<ref>Westwood, ''Fighting Ships''</ref>

[[Image:SempillMission.jpg|thumb|left|Captain Sempill showing a Sparrowhawk to Admiral [[Togo Heihachiro]], 1921.]]

By 1921, Japan's naval expenditure reached nearly 32% of the national budget. By 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy possessed 10 battleships, 10 aircraft carriers, 38 cruisers (heavy and light), 112 destroyers, 65 submarines, and various auxiliary ships.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/ijn-rise.htm globalsecurity.org]</ref>

Japan at times continued to solicit foreign expertise in areas in which the IJN was inexperienced in, such as naval aviation. In 1918 Japan invited the [[French Military Mission to Japan (1918-1919)]], composed of 50 members and equipped with several of the newest types of airplanes to establish the fundamentals of Japanese naval aviation (the planes were several [[Salmson 2]]A2, [[Nieuport]], [[Spad XIII]], two [[Breguet XIV]], as well as [[Caquot]] [[dirigible]]s). In 1921, Japan hosted for a year and a half the [[Sempill Mission]], a group of British instructors who were able to train and advise the Imperial Japanese Navy on several new aircraft such as the [[Gloster Aircraft Company|Gloster]] [[Gloster Sparrowhawk|Sparrowhawk]], and on various techniques such as torpedo bombing and flight control.

During the pre-war years, two schools of thought battled over whether the Navy should be organized around powerful battleships, ultimately able to defeat American ones in Japanese waters, or around aircraft carriers. Neither really prevailed, and both lines of ships were developed, with the result neither solution displayed overwhelming strength over the American adversary. A consistent weakness of Japanese warship development was the tendency to incorporate too much armament, and too much engine power, in comparison to ship size (a side-effect of the Washington Treaty), leading to shortcomings in stability, protection and structural strength.<ref>Lyon ''World War II warships'' p.35</ref> This was a failing of Japanese naval architects, reflecting her industrial and engineering weakness.

==World War II==
{{main|List of Japanese government and military commanders of World War II|Imperial Japanese Navy of World War II}}

[[Image:IJN Izumo in Shanghai.jpg|thumb|Imperial Japanese Navy cruiser ''[[Japanese cruiser Izumo|Izumo]]'' in [[Shanghai]] in 1937.]]
The Imperial Japanese Navy of World War II was administered by the [[Ministry of the Navy of Japan]] and controlled by the Chief of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff]] at [[Imperial General Headquarters]]. In order to combat the numerically superior American navy, the IJN devoted large amounts of resources to creating a force superior in quality to any navy at the time. Consequently, at the beginning of [[World War II]], Japan probably had the most sophisticated Navy in the world.<ref>Howe, p286</ref> Betting on the speedy success of aggressive tactics (stemming from Mahanian doctrine and the lure of "decisive battle"), Japan did not invest significantly on defensive organization: she needed to protect her long shipping lines against enemy submarines, which she never managed to do, particularly under-investing in the vital role of [[antisubmarine warfare]] (both escort ships and [[escort aircraft carrier]]s), and in the specialized training and organization to support it.<ref>Parillo, Mark. ''Japanese Merchant Marine in World War II''. Annapolis, MD: United States Naval Institute Press, 1993.</ref>

IJN enjoyed spectacular success during the first part of the hostilities, but American forces ultimately managed to gain the upper hand through technological upgrades to its air and naval forces and a vastly stronger industrial output. Japan's reluctance to use their [[submarine]] fleet for commerce raiding and failure to secure their communications also hastened her defeat. During the last phase of the war, the Imperial Japanese Navy resorted to a series of desperate measures, including a variety of [[Japanese Special Attack Units|Special Attack Units]] (popularly called ''[[kamikaze]]'').

===Battleships===
[[Image:Yamatotrials.jpg|thumb|right|[[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']], the largest [[battleship]] in history, in 1941.]]

Japan continued to attribute considerable prestige to [[battleship]]s and endeavoured to build the largest and most powerful ships of the period. [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']], the largest and most heavily-armed battleship in history, was launched in 1941.

The second half of World War II saw the last battleship duels. In the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal|Battle of Guadalcanal]] on [[November 15]] [[1942]], the United States battleships [[USS South Dakota (BB-57)|''South Dakota'']] and [[USS Washington (BB-56)|''Washington'']] fought and destroyed the Japanese battleship [[Japanese battleship Kirishima|''Kirishima'']]. In the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] on [[25 October]] [[1944]] six battleships, led by Admiral [[Jesse B. Oldendorf|Jesse Oldendorf]] of the [[U.S. 7th Fleet]] fired upon and claimed credit for sinking Admiral [[Shoji Nishimura]]'s battleships [[Japanese battleship Yamashiro|''Yamashiro'']] and [[Japanese battleship Fus<U+014D>|''Fus<U+014D>'']] during the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]]; in fact, both battleships were fatally crippled by destroyer attacks before being brought under fire by Oldendorf's old battleships.

Nevertheless, the [[Battle off Samar]] on [[25 October]] [[1944]] during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] showed battleships could still be useful. Only the indecision of Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]] and the fight by American destroyers and [[destroyer escort]]s saved the American aircraft carriers of "[[Taffy 3]]" from destruction by the gunfire of ''Yamato'', ''[[Japanese battleship Kong<U+014D>|Kong<U+014D>]]'', ''Haruna'', and ''[[Japanese battleship Nagato|Nagato]]'' and their cruiser escort. Miraculously for the Americans, only [[USS Gambier Bay (CVE-73)|USS ''Gambier Bay'']], along with two destroyers and one destroyer escort, were lost in this action.

Ultimately, the maturity of air power spelled doom for the battleship. Battleships in the Pacific ended up primarily performing shore bombardment and anti-aircraft defense for the carriers. ''Yamato'' and [[Japanese battleship Musashi|''Musashi'']] were sunk by air attacks long before coming in gun range of the American fleet. As a result of the changing technology, plans for even larger battleships, such as the Japanese [[Super Yamato class|Super ''Yamato'' class]], were cancelled.

===Aircraft carriers===<!-- This section is linked from [[World War II]] -->
In the 1920s, the ''Kaga'' (originally laid down as a battleship) and a similar ship, the ''Akagi'' (originally laid down as a battlecruiser) were converted to aircraft carriers to satisfy the terms of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]].

By 1935-1938, senior IJN admirals believed the aircraft carrier to be the equal of the capital ship.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}<!--Not judging by doctrine, or their actions in the war--> ''Akagi'' and ''Kaga'' received extensive rebuilds to improve aircraft handling capacity. Japan put particular emphasis on [[aircraft carrier]]s. The Imperial Japanese Navy started the [[Pacific War]] with 10 aircraft carriers, the largest and most modern carrier fleet in the world at that time. There were seven American aircraft carriers at the beginning of hostilities, only three operating in the Pacific; and eight British aircraft carriers, of which a single one operated in the Indian Ocean. The IJN's two [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh<U+014D>kaku|''Sh<U+014D>kaku'']]-class carriers were superior to any carrier in the world, until the wartime appearance of the American [[Essex class aircraft carrier|''Essex'']]-class.<ref>"In many ways the Japanese were in the forefront of carrier design, and in 1941, the two ''Sh<U+014D>kakus'' &mdash; the culmination of prewar Japanese design &mdash; were superior to any carrier in the world then in commission" Evans, ''Kaigun'' p323</ref> A large number of these Japanese carriers were of small size, however, in accordance with the limitations placed upon the Navy by the London and Washington Naval Conferences.

Following the [[Battle of Midway]], in which four Japanese fleet carriers were sunk, the Japanese Navy suddenly found itself short of fleet carriers (as well as trained aircrews), resulting in an ambitious set of projects to convert commercial and military vessels into escort carriers, such as the [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiy<U+014D>|''Hiy<U+014D>'']]. Another conversion project, [[Japanese aircraft carrier Shinano|''Shinano'']], was based on an incomplete ''Yamato''-class super battleship and became the largest-displacement carrier of World War II. The IJN also attempted to build a number of fleet carriers, though most of these projects were not completed by the end of the war. One exception being the [[Japanese aircraft carrier Taih<U+014D>|''Taih<U+014D>'']], which was the first and only Japanese carrier with an armored flight deck and first to incorporate a closed hurricane bow.

===Naval aviation===
{{main|Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service}}
[[Image:Carrier shokaku.jpg|thumb|right|Planes from the Japanese aircraft carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Shokaku|''Shokaku'']] preparing the attack on [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]].]]

Japan began the war with a highly competent naval air force designed around some of the best airplanes in the world: the [[A6M Zero|Zero]] was considered the best carrier aircraft of the beginning of the war, the [[Mitsubishi G3M]] bomber was remarkable for its range and speed, and the [[Kawanishi H8K]] was world's best flying boat.<ref>"For speed and maneuverability, for example the Zero was matchless; for range and speed few bombers surpassed the Mitsubishi G3M, and in the Kawanishi H8K, the Japanese navy had the world's best flying boat" Evans, ''Kaigun'', p312</ref> The Japanese pilot corps at the beginning of the war were of high caliber as compared to their contemporaries around the world due to intense training and frontline experience in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]].<ref>"by 1941, by training and experience, Japan's naval aviators were undoubtedly the best among the world's three carrier forces" Evans, ''Kaigun'', p325</ref> The Navy also had a competent tactical bombing force based around the Mitsubishi G3M and [[Mitsubishi G4M|G4M]] bombers, which astonished the world by being the first planes to sink enemy capital ships underway, claiming battleship [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|''Prince of Wales'']] and the battlecruiser [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|''Repulse'']].

As the war dragged on, the Allies found weaknesses in Japanese Naval Aviation. Though most Japanese aircraft were characterized by great operating ranges, they had very little in the way of defensive armament and armor. As a result, the more numerous, heavily armed and armored American aircraft were able to develop techniques that nullified the advantages of the Japanese aircraft. Although there were delays in engine development, several new competitive designs were developed during the war, but industrial weaknesses, lack of raw materials and disorganization due to Allied bombing raids hampered their mass-production. Furthermore, the IJN didn't have an efficient process for rapid training of aviators, as two years of training were usually considered necessary for a carrier flyer.  Therefore, they weren't able to effectively replace seasoned pilots lost through attrition following their initial successes in the Pacific campaign. The IJN pilots' later inexperience was especially evident during the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], when their aircraft were shot down in droves by the American naval pilots in what the Americans later called the "[[Great Marianas Turkey Shoot#Japanese_raids:_The_Great_Marianas_Turkey_Shoot |Great Marianas Turkey Shoot]]." Following the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], the Japanese Navy increasingly opted towards deploying aircraft in the ''kamikaze'' role.

[[Image:Kikka.jpg|thumb|Japan's first jet-powered aircraft, the Imperial Japanese Navy's [[Nakajima J9Y|Nakajima J9Y Kikka]] (1945).]]

Towards the end of the conflict, several competitive plane designs were developed, such as the 1943 [[Kawanishi N1K-J|Shiden]], but such planes were produced too late and in insufficient numbers (415 units for the Shiden) to affect the outcome of the war. Radical new plane designs were also developed, such as the [[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]] design [[Ky<U+016B>sh<U+016B> J7W|''Shinden'']], and especially jet-powered aircraft such as the [[Nakajima J9Y|Nakajima ''Kikka'']] and the rocket-propelled [[Mitsubishi J8M]]. These jet designs were partially based on technology received from Nazi Germany, usually in the form of a few drawings only, ''Kikka'' being based on the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] and the J8M on the [[Messerschmitt Me 163]]), so Japanese manufacturers had to play a key role in the final engineering. These developments also happened too late in the conflict to have any influence on the outcome. The ''Kikka'' only flew once before the end of the war.
<br clear=all>

===Submarines===
[[Image:I-400.jpg|thumb|An Imperial Japanese Navy's ''[[I-400 class submarine]]'', the largest submarine type of World War II.]]
{{main|Imperial Japanese Navy submarines}}

Japan had by far the most varied fleet of [[submarines]] of [[World War II]], including manned torpedoes (''[[Kaiten]]''), midget submarines ([[Ko-hyoteki class submarine|''Ko-hyoteki'']], [[Kairyu class submarine|''Kairyu'']]), medium-range submarines, purpose-built supply submarines (many for use by the Army), long-range fleet submarines (many of which carried an aircraft), submarines with the highest submerged speeds of the conflict ([[I-200 class submarine|''Senkou I-200'']]), and submarines that could carry multiple bombers (World War II's largest submarine, the [[I-400 class submarine|''Sentoku I-400'']]). These submarines were also equipped with the most advanced torpedo of the conflict, the Type 95 torpedo, a 21" (533 mm) version of the famous 24" (61cm) Type 91. 

A plane from one such long-range fleet submarine, ''[[I-25 (submarine)|I-25]]'', conducted what is still the only aerial bombing attack on the continental United States when Warrant Flying Officer [[Nobuo Fujita]] attempted to start massive forest fires in the Pacific Northwest outside the town of [[Brookings, Oregon|Brookings]], [[Oregon]] on September 9th, 1942. Other submarines undertook trans-oceanic missions to German-occupied Europe, such as [[Japanese submarine I-30|''I-30'']], [[Japanese submarine I-8|''I-8'']], [[Japanese submarine I-34|''I-34'']], [[Japanese submarine I-29|''I-29'']] and ''[[Japanese submarine I-52|I-52]]'', in one case flying a Japanese [[seaplane]] over France in a propaganda coup.<ref>''Japanese submarines'', p70</ref> In May 1942, [[Ko-hyoteki class submarine|Type A]] midget submarines were used in the [[Attack on Sydney Harbour]], and the [[Battle of Madagascar]].

[[Image:I-8Brest.jpg|thumb|Submarine ''[[Japanese submarine I-8|I-8]]'' in [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[France]] in 1943.]]

Overall, despite their technical prowesses, Japanese submarines were relatively unsuccessful. They were often used in offensive roles against warships (''per'' Mahanian doctrine), which were fast, maneuverable and well-defended compared to merchant ships. In 1942, Japanese submarines managed to sink two fleet carriers, one cruiser, and a few destroyers and other warships, and damage several others. They were not able to sustain these results afterwards, as Allied fleets were reinforced and started using better anti-submarine tactics. By the end of the war, submarines were instead often used to transport supplies to island garrisons. During the war, Japan managed to sink about 1 million tons of merchant shipping (184 ships), compared to 1.5 million tons for Britain (493 ships), 4.65 million tons for the US (1079 ships)<ref>[http://www.valoratsea.com/month1.htm Tonnage Sunk, Pacific 1941 - 1945]</ref> and 14.3 million tons for Germany (2840 ships).

Early models were not very maneuverable under water, could not dive very deep, and lacked [[radar]]. Later in the war, units fitted with radar were in some instances sunk due to the ability of US radar sets to detect their emissions. For example, [[USS Batfish (SS-310)|''Batfish'']] (SS-310) sank three such in the span of four days. After the end of the conflict, several of Japan's most original submarines were sent to Hawaii for inspection in "Operation Road's End" ([[I-400 class submarine|''I-400'']], ''I-401'', [[I-200 class submarine|''I-201'']] and ''I-203'') before being scuttled by the U.S. Navy in 1946 when the Soviets demanded access to the submarines as well.

===Special Attack Units===

{{main|Japanese Special Attack Units}}
At the end of the [[Second World War]], numerous [[Japanese Special Attack Units|Special Attack Units]] (Japanese: <U+7279><U+5225><U+653B><U+6483><U+968A>, ''tokubetsu k<U+014D>geki tai'', also abbreviated to <U+7279><U+653B><U+968A>, ''tokk<U+014D>tai'') were developed for suicide missions, in a desperate move to compensate for the annihilation of the main fleet. These units included ''[[Kamikaze]]'' ("Divine Wind") bombers, ''[[Shinyo]]'' ("Sea Quake") suicide boats, ''[[Kairyu class submarine|Kairyu]]'' ("Sea Dragon") suicide [[midget submarine]]s, ''[[Kaiten]]'' ("Turn of Heaven") suicide [[torpedoes]], and ''[[Fukuryu]]'' ("Crouching Dragon") suicide scuba divers who would swim under boats and use explosives mounted on bamboo poles to destroy both the boat and themselves. Kamikaze planes were particularly effective during the defense of [[Okinawa]], in which 1465 planes were expended to damage around 250 American warships.

A considerable number of Special Attack Units were built and stored in coastal hideouts for the desperate defense of the Home islands, with the potential to destroy or damage thousands of enemy warships.

==Self-Defense Forces==

Following Japan's surrender to the [[Allies]] at the conclusion of [[World War II]], and Japan's subsequent occupation, Japan's entire imperial military was dissolved in the new 1947 [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]] which states, "The Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes." Japan's current navy falls under the umbrella of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] (JSDF) as the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] (JMSDF).
