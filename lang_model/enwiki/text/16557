A '''gamelan''' is a kind of [[musical ensemble]] of [[Indonesia]] typically featuring a variety of instruments such as [[metallophones]], [[xylophone]]s, [[drum]]s, and [[gong]]s; bamboo flutes, bowed and plucked strings, and vocalists may also be included. The term refers more to the set of instruments than the players of those instruments. A gamelan as a set of instruments is a distinct entity, built and tuned to stay together <U+2014> instruments from different gamelan are not interchangeable.

The word "gamelan" comes from the [[Javanese language|Javanese]] word "gamel", meaning to strike or hammer, and the suffix "an", which makes the root a collective noun.

== Instruments and characteristics ==

'''Gamelan''' is found in the Indonesian islands of [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Madura]], [[Bali]], and [[Lombok]] (and other [[Sunda Islands]]), in a wide variety of ensemble sizes and formations. In Bali and Lombok today, and in Java through the 18th century, the term "gong" has been preferred to or synonymous with gamelan. Traditions of gamelan-like ensembles (a well known example of which is [[Kulintang]], sometimes called "[[gong-chime ensemble]]s" by ethnomusicologists) also exist in the [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Suriname]], sometimes due to emigration, historic trade, or diplomacy. More recently, through immigration and local enthusiasm, gamelan ensembles have become active throughout Europe, America, Asia, and Australia.

Although gamelan ensembles sometimes include solo and choral voices, plucked and/or bowed [[string instruments|string]] and [[wind instrument]]s, they are most notable for the large number of metal [[percussion instrument]]s. The percussion instruments of a central Javanese gamelan ensemble include: 
* [[metallophone]]s, such as the ''[[saron (instrument)|saron]]'', ''[[gend<U+00E9>r]]'', ''[[gangsa]]'', and ''[[ugal]]'' (sets of metals bars laid out in a single row and struck like a [[glockenspiel]])
* cradled [[gong chime]]s called ''[[bonang]]'' and ''[[kenong]]'' (sets of large, drum-shaped gongs laid out horizontally on stands)
* hanging [[gong]]s called ''[[kempul]]'' and the large ''[[gong ageng]]''
* [[xylophone]]-like instruments called ''[[gambang]]'' (similar to ''saron'' and ''gend<U+00E9>r'' but with wooden bars instead of metal ones)
* drums called ''[[kendhang]]''

Metals used include [[bronze]], [[brass]], and [[iron]], with a 10:3 copper-to-tin bronze [[alloy]] usually considered the best material. In addition, there are gamelan ensembles composed entirely of [[bamboo]]-keyed instruments, of bamboo [[flute]]s, of [[zither]]s, or of unaccompanied voices with the functions of metallophones or gongs in the metal ensemble transferred to surrogates.

'''Gamelan''' music is built up in layers. At its centre is a basic melody (core melody) known as the [[balungan]]. Further layers, including singing in vocal pieces, elaborate upon this melody in certain ways, but the notes of each layer of music relate to the balungan, and generally coincide at the ends of phrases (called ''[[seleh]]'' in Javanese). There are also a set of instruments which delineate a [[colotomic structure]], usually ending in the stroke of the largest gong.

==History==
The gamelan has an old and mysterious origin. Apparently it predates the Hindu-Buddhist culture that dominated Indonesia in its earliest records, and instead represents a native art form. The instruments developed into their current form during the [[Majapahit Empire]].<ref>The Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia, ''Bulletin for National Museum of Canada'' (Ottawa: April 1961), p. 2, cited in Donald A. Lentz. ''The Gamelan Music of Java and Bali: An Artistic Anomaly Complementary to Primary Tonal Theoretical Systems''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1965. Page 5.</ref> In contrast to the heavy Indian influence in other art forms, the only obvious Indian influence in gamelan music is in the Javanese style of singing.<ref>Lentz, 5.</ref>

In Javanese mythology, the gamelan was created by [[Sang Hyang Guru]] in [[Saka era]] 167 (c. AD 230), the god who ruled as king of all Java from a palace on the Maendra mountains in Medangkamulan (now [[Mount Lawu]]). He needed a signal to summon the gods, and thus invented the gong. For more complex messages, he invented two other Gongs, thus forming the original gamelan set.<ref>R.T. Warsodiningrat, ''Serat Weda Pradangga''. Cited in Roth, A. R. ''New Compositions for Javanese Gamelan''. University of Durham, Doctoral Thesis, 1986. Page 4.</ref>

In the palaces of Java are the oldest known ensembles, the [[Munggang]] and [[Kodokngorek]] gamelans, apparently from the 12th century. These formed the basis of a "loud style." A different, "soft style" developed out of the [[kemanak]] tradition and is related to the traditions of singing [[Javanese poetry]], in a manner which is often believed to be similar to performance of modern [[bedhaya]] dance. In the 17th century, these loud and soft styles mixed, and to a large extent the variety of modern gamelan styles of Bali, Java, and Sunda resulted from different ways of mixing these elements. Thus, despite the seeming diversity of styles, many of the same theoretical concepts, instruments, and techniques are shared between the styles.<ref>Roth, 4-8</ref>

== Varieties of gamelan ensembles ==
{{seealso|List of gamelan varieties}}
There are a wide variety of gamelan ensembles, distinguished by their collection of instruments and use of voice, tunings, repertoire, style, and cultural context. In general, no two gamelan ensembles are the same, and those that arose in prestigious courts are often considered to have their own style. Certain styles may also be shared by nearby ensembles, leading to a regional style. 

The varieties are generally grouped geographically, with the principal division between the styles favored by the Balinese, Javanese, and Sundanese peoples. Balinese gamelan is often associated with the virtuosity and rapid changes of tempo and dynamics of [[Gamelan gong kebyar]], its best-known style. Other popular Balinese styles include [[Gamelan angklung]] and [[kecak]], also known as the "monkey chant." Javanese gamelan was largely dominated by the courts of the 19th century central Javanese rulers, each with its own style, but overall is known for a slower, more meditative style than that of Bali. 

Outside of the main core on Java and Bali, gamelans have spread through migration and cultural interest, new styles sometimes result as well. Malay gamelans are designed in ways that are similar to the Javanese gamelan except that the tune is higher. The gamelans were traditionally played in [[Riau]]. Gamelan is also related to the Philippine [[kulintang]] ensemble. There is also a wide variety of gamelan in the West, including both traditional and experimental ensembles. See [[gamelan outside Indonesia]] for more information on these styles.

== Cultural context ==
In Indonesia, gamelan usually accompanies dance, [[wayang]] puppet performances, or rituals or ceremonies. Typically players in the gamelan will be familiar with dance moves and poetry, while dancers are able to play in the ensemble. In wayang, the [[dalang]] (puppeteer) must have a thorough knowledge of gamelan, as he gives the cues for the music. Gamelan can be performed by itself - in "klenengan" style, or for radio broadcasts - but concerts in the Western style are not traditional.<ref>Broughton, Simon, et al., eds. ''World Music: The Rough Guide''. London: The Rough Guides, 1994. ISBN 1858280176. Page 419-420</ref>

Gamelan's role in rituals is so important that there is a Javanese saying that "It's not official until the gong is hung."<ref name="B420">Broughton, 420</ref> Some performances are associated with royalty, such as visits by the [[sultan of Yogyakarta]]. Certain gamelans are associated with specific rituals, such as the [[Gamelan Sekaten]], which is used in celebration of [[Mawlid an-Nabi]] ([[Muhammad]]'s birthday). In Bali, almost all religious rituals include gamelan performance. Gamelan is also used in the ceremonies of the [[Catholicism in Indonesia|Catholic church in Indonesia]].<ref>Lindsay, 45</ref> Certain pieces are designated for starting and ending performances or ceremonies. When a "leaving" piece (such as "[[Udan Mas]]") is begun, the audience will know that the event is nearly finished and will begin to leave. Certain pieces are also believed to possess magic powers, and can be used to ward off evil spirits.<ref name="B420"/>

Gamelan is frequently played on the radio. For example, the [[Pura Pakualaman]] gamelan performs live on the radio every Minggu Pon (a day in the 35-day cycle of the [[Javanese calendar]]).<ref name="B420"/> In major towns, the [[Radio Republik Indonesia]] employs professional musicians and actors, and broadcast programs of a wide variety of gamelan music and drama.<ref name="B421">Broughton, 421.</ref>

In the court tradition of central Java, gamelan is often played in the [[pendopo]], an open pavilion with a cavernous, double-pitched roof, no side walls, and a hard marble or tile floor. The instruments are placed on a platform to one side, which allows the sound to reverberate in the roof space and enhances the acoustics.<ref>Roth, 17</ref> 

In Bali, the Gamelan instruments are all kept together in the balai banjar, a community meeting hall which has a large open space with a roof over top of it with several open sides. The instruments are all kept here together because they believe that all of the instruments belong to the community as a whole and no one person has ownership over an instrument. Not only is this where the instruments are stored, but this is also the practice space for the sekaha (Gamelan orchestra). The open walls allow for the music to flow out into the community where the rest of the people can enjoy it.

The sekaha is led by a single instructor whose job it is in the community to lead this group and to come up with new songs. When they are working on a new song, the instructor will lead the group in practice and help the group form the new piece of music as they are practicing. When the instructor creates a new song, he leaves enough open for interpretation that the group can improvise and as a group they will be writing the music as they are practicing it. 

The Balinese Gamelan groups are constantly changing their music by taking older pieces they know and mixing them together as well as trying new variations on their music. Their music is always constantly changing because they believe that music should grow and change; the only exception to this is with their most sacred songs which they will not change. A single new piece of music can take several months before it is completed.

Men and women usually perform in separate groups, with the exception of the [[pesindhen]], the female singer who performs with male groups.<ref name="B421"/>

In the West, gamelan is often performed in a concert context, but may also incorporate dance or wayang.

== Tuning ==
[[Image:Traditional indonesian stringed instrument.jpg|thumb|Celempung - Indonesian Embassy in [[Canberra]].]]
The tuning and construction of a gamelan orchestra is a complex process. Javanese gamelans use two [[musical tuning|tuning systems]]: ''[[sl<U+00E9>ndro]]'' and ''[[p<U+00E9>log]]''. There are other tuning systems such as ''[[degung]]'' (exclusive to Sunda, or West Java), and ''[[madenda]]'' (also known as ''diatonis'', similar to a European [[natural minor scale]]). In central Javanese gamelan, ''sl<U+00E9>ndro'' is a system with five notes to the [[pythagorean interval|diapason]] ([[octave]]), fairly evenly spaced, while ''p<U+00E9>log'' has seven notes to the octave, with uneven intervals, usually played in five note subsets of the seven-tone collection. This results in sound quite different from music played in a western tuning system. Many gamelan orchestras will include instruments in each tuning, but each individual instrument will only be able to play notes in one. The precise tuning used differs from ensemble to ensemble, and give each ensemble its own particular flavour. The intervals between notes in a scale are very close to identical for different instruments ''within'' each gamelan, but the intervals vary from one gamelan to the next.  

[[Colin McPhee]] remarked, "Deviations in what is considered the same scale are so large that one might with reason state that there are as many scales as there are gamelans."<ref>Colin McPhee, ''Music in Bali''. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1966.</ref> However, this view is contested by some teachers of gamelan, and there have been efforts to combine multiple ensembles and tuning structures into one gamelan to ease transportation at festival time. One such ensemble is gamelan Manikasanti, which can play the repertoire of many different ensembles.

Balinese gamelan instruments are commonly played in pairs which are tuned slightly apart to produce [[interference]] [[beat (acoustics)|beats]], ideally at a consistent speed for all pairs of notes in all registers. It is thought that this contributes to the very "busy" and "shimmering" sound of gamelan ensembles. In the religious ceremonies that contain gamelan, these interference beats are meant to give the listener a feeling of a god's presence or a stepping stone to a meditative state.

==Notation==
Traditionally gamelan music is not notated, and began as an [[oral tradition]]. However, in the 19th century the kratons of Yogyakarta and Surakarta developed distinct notations for transcribing the reportoire. These were not used to read the music, which was memorized, but to preserve pieces in the court records. The Yogyanese notation is a checkerboard notation, which uses six vertical lines to represent notes of higher pitch in the [[balungan]] (core melody), and horizontal lines which represent the series of beats, read downward with time. The fourth vertical line and every fourth horizontal line (completing a [[gatra]]) are darkened for legibility. Symbols on the left indicate the [[colotomic structure]] of gongs and so forth, while specific drum features are notated in symbols to the right. The Solonese notation reads horizontally, like Western notation, but does not use barlines. Instead, note values and rests are squiggled between the notes.<ref>Lindsay, Jennifer. ''Javanese Gamelan''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1979. Pp. 27-28. ISBN 0195804139</ref> 

Today this notation is relatively rare, and has been replaced by [[kepatihan notation]], which is a cipher system. Kepatihan notation developed around 1900 at the [[kepatihan]] in Surakarta. The pitches are numbered (see the articles on the scales [[slendro]] and [[p<U+00E9>log]] for an explanation of how), and are read across with dots and lines indicating the register and time values. Like the palace notations, however, they record only the balungan part, and to a large extent what is heard relies on memorized patterns the performers call upon during performance. However, teachers have also devised certain notations, generally using kepatihan principles, for the [[cengkok]] (melodic patterns) of each [[elaborating instrument]]. In ethnomusicological studies, transcriptions are often made onto a Western staff, sometimes with unusual [[clef]]s.<ref>For example, in Sorrell, Neil. ''A Guide to the Gamelan''. United Kingdom: Faber and Faber, 1990.</ref>

== Influence on Western music ==

The gamelan has been appreciated by several western composers of [[European classical music|classical music]], most famously [[Claude Debussy]] who heard a Javanese gamelan play at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Paris Exposition of 1889]] ([[World's Fair]]). (The gamelan Debussy heard was in the ''slendro'' scale and was played by Central Javanese musicians.<ref>Neil Sorrell. ''A Guide to the Gamelan''. London: Faber and Faber, 2000. Page 2-7 discusses the incident, about which much remains uncertain. In particular, it is unknown whether they played the [[Cirebon]]ese instruments that the [[Paris Conservatoire]] received in 1887, which would be substantially different from their ordinary set, or if they brought their own set.</ref>) Despite his enthusiasm, direct citations of gamelan scales, melodies, rhythms, or ensemble textures have not been located in any of Debussy's own compositions. However, the equal-tempered [[whole tone]] scale appears in his music of this time and afterward,<ref>Ibid. Although the five notes of the ''slendro'' set are closest in pitch to a [[pentatonic scale]], this scale would have been familiar from other folk sources, as it is a common scale worldwide. It is the equally tempered whole-tone scale that is more analogous of the exotic ''slendro'' scale.</ref> and a Javanese gamelan-like heterophonic texture is emulated on occasion, particularly in "Pagodes", from ''Estampes'' (solo piano, 1903), in which the [[gong ageng|great gong]]'s [[colotomy|cyclic punctuation]] is symbolized by a prominent perfect fifth.

Direct homages to gamelan music are to be found in works for western instruments by [[B<U+00E9>la Bart<U+00F3>k]], [[Francis Poulenc]], [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Colin McPhee]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[Pat Metheny]], and [[Steve Reich]]. In more recent times, [[United States|American]] composers such as [[Barbara Benary]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Lou Harrison]], [[Dennis Murphy (musician)|Dennis Murphy]], [[Loren Nerell]], [[Michael Tenzer]], [[Evan Ziporyn]], [[Daniel James Wolf]] and [[Jody Diamond]] as well as [[Australia]]n composers such as [[Peter Sculthorpe]], [[Andrew Schultz]] and [[Ross Edwards (composer)|Ross Edwards]] have written several works with parts for gamelan instruments or full gamelan ensembles. [[I Nyoman Windha]] is among contemporary Indonesian composers that have written compositions using western instruments along with Gamelan. Hungarian composer [[Gy<U+00F6>rgy Ligeti]] wrote a piano <U+00E9>tude called ''Galamb Borong'' influenced by gamelan. American folk guitarist [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]] included elements of gamelan in many of his late-60s sound collages, and again in his 1997 collaboration with [[Cul de Sac (band)|Cul de Sac]], ''The Epiphany of Glenn Jones.'' The experimental art-rock band [[King Crimson]], while not using gamelan instruments, used interlocking rhythmic paired guitars that were influenced by gamelan.<ref>[http://www.progressiveears.com/frippbook/ch09.htm http://www.progressiveears.com/frippbook/ch09.htm]</ref> Experimental pop groups [[The Residents]], [[Mouse on Mars]], [[His Name Is Alive]], [[Xiu Xiu]], [[Macha (band)|Macha]] and the [[Sun City Girls]] have used gamelan percussion. The gamelan has also been used by British multi-instrumentalist [[Mike Oldfield]] at least three times, "Woodhenge" (1979), "The Wind Chimes (Part II)" (1987) and "Nightshade" (2005).

Recently, many Americans were first introduced to the sounds of gamelan by the popular anime film ''[[Akira (film)|Akira]]''. Gamelan elements are used in this film to punctuate several exciting fight scenes, as well as to symbolize the emerging psychic powers of the tragic hero, Tetsuo. The gamelan in the film's score was performed by the members of the [[Japan]]ese musical collective [[Geinoh Yamashirogumi]]. Gamelan and kecak are also used in the soundtrack to the video game [[Secret of Mana]]. The musical soundtrack for the Sci Fi Channel series [[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|Battlestar Galactica]] features extensive use of the gamelan, particularly in the 3rd season.<ref>[http://www.soundtrack.net/news/article/?id=941 SoundtrackNet 2/28/07 article]</ref> 

The most recent use of gamelan was in the prodigy's song 'hot ride'. this combined the rhythms of modern dance music with a melody produced by the gamelan, another example is EXEC_PAJA/.#Orica extracting, a song sung by [[Haruka Shimotsuki]] as part of [[Ar tonelico: Melody of Elemia]] soundtracks, the song starts with gamelan melody.
