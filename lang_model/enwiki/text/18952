After winning two championships with [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]], Schumacher moved to the [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] team in 1996, which had not won a drivers' championship since 1979, with [[Jody Scheckter]]. From 2000 to 2004, Schumacher won five consecutive drivers' titles with the team.

==Early years==
[[Image:Reynard F 903-001 1990 Michael Schuhmacher Formula 3 EMS.jpg|thumb|right|Schumacher's title-winning German [[Formula Three]] car from 1990.]]
Schumacher is the son of Rolf, a bricklayer who ran the local kart track in [[Kerpen]] for a second job. His mother Elisabeth<ref name="blogcritics">{{cite news | title = Michael Schumacher Says Goodbye To F1 | publisher = Sports@Blogcritics.org | date = 2006-09-10 | url = http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/09/10/155725.php |first = Ashleigh |last = Charlesworth | accessdate = 2006-10-30}}</ref> worked in the canteen. He began [[kart racing]] at the age of four, using a homemade kart built by his father. It was nothing more than a pedal-kart that had been fitted with a small motorcycle engine. He quickly mastered the vehicle, winning his first kart championship at the age of six. Schumacher's parents could not afford to develop his driving talents further. Instead, they had to rely upon the generosity and sponsorship of a few affluent people who also saw the potential of their son.<ref name="schumacher hof" />

From 1984 Schumacher won numerous German and [[European]] kart championships, including the Formula Konig Series. By 1987 he was the German and European kart champion, at which point he withdrew from school and began working as a mechanic. In 1988 Schumacher raced in the [[Formula Ford]] series and competed in the German [[Formula 3]] series for the next two years, winning the title in 1990. Towards the end of 1990 he joined the [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] junior racing programme in the [[1990 World Sportscar Championship season|World Sports-Prototype Championship]], gaining a victory at the season finale at the [[Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez]] in a [[Sauber]]-[[Mercedes-Benz C11|Mercedes C11]] and finishing fifth in the drivers championship.  He continued with the team into the [[1991 World Sportscar Championship season|1991]] season, winning again at the season finale at Autopolis in Japan with a [[Sauber]]-[[Mercedes-Benz C291]], leading to a ninth place finish in the drivers championship.  He also briefly competed in the [[Japan|Japanese]] [[Formula 3000]] Championship and the [[DTM (racing)|German Touring Car Championship]] in the early 1990s.

==Formula One career==
Schumacher was noted throughout his career for his ability to produce fast laps at crucial moments in a race, his ability to push his car to the very limit, and for his driving abilities in wet conditions. Wet conditions are often thought of as the great equaliser in Formula One racing, where driver skills trump all else. Some of Schumacher's best performances occurred in such conditions, earning him the title "Regenk<U+00F6>nig" (rain king) or "Regenmeister" (rain master).<ref>{{cite news |title = Schumacher races to victory

He is also nicknamed "Schumi"<ref>{{cite news | title = Alonso ahead of Schumi | publisher = News24 | date = 2006-10-21 | url = http://www.news24.com/News24/Sport/More_Sport/0,9294,2-9-32_2018131,00.html | accessdate =2006-10-22}}</ref>, "Schuey"<ref>{{cite news | title = Schuey exit promises many twists and turns

Schumacher is credited with popularising Formula One in Germany, where it was considered a fringe sport.<ref name = superwheels">{{cite web | url = http://www.superwheels.co.za/default.asp?id=4846&des=sportstalk | title = The greatest driver of all time| accessdate = 2006-10-24| author = Sapa| date = 2006-09-11
| work = | publisher = SuperWheels}}</ref> In 2006, three of the top ten drivers were German, more than any other nationality and more than has ever been present in Formula One history. Younger German drivers, such as [[Sebastian Vettel]], feel Schumacher was key in opening doors for them in Formula One.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vettel sorry to see 'idol' Schumacher go |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/54667 |work= |publisher=Autosport |first = Jonathan |last = Noble |date=2006-09-26 |accessdate=2006-10-31 }}</ref>

Latterly the senior driver in Formula One, Schumacher was for many years the president of the [[Grand Prix Drivers Association]].
===Debut===
[[Image:Jordan 191 rain.png|thumb|left|Schumacher testing the [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan 191]].]]
Schumacher made his Formula One debut with the [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]]-[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] team at the [[1991 Belgian Grand Prix]] as a replacement for the imprisoned [[Bertrand Gachot]]. Schumacher, still a contracted Mercedes driver, was signed by [[Eddie Jordan]] after he performed impressively at a Silverstone test the week before the race. His manager Willi Weber assured Jordan that he knew the challenging [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa]] circuit well, despite the fact that he had only been around the track once on a bicycle.<ref>{{cite news | title = Schumacher great but controversial | publisher = CNN.com | date = 2006-09-10 | url =http://www.cnn.com/2006/SPORT/09/10/motor.career/index.html | accessdate =2006-10-23}}</ref> Schumacher impressed the paddock by qualifying seventh in his first competition in a Formula One car, matching the team's season-best grid position, and out-qualifying his team mate, [[Andrea de Cesaris]], an  11-year  veteran. He retired on the first lap of the race with [[clutch]] problems.<ref name="f1-1991 Belgian gp result">{{cite web| url =http://www.formula1.com/archive/grandprix/1991/209.html | title = 1991 Belgian Grand Prix | accessdate = 2006-10-24| date = 2006| work = Results Archive| publisher = The Official Formula 1 Website

===Benetton years===
====1991 <U+2212> 1993====

[[Image:Benetton 191.jpg|thumb|250px|right|After his debut for Jordan, Schumacher was signed by Benetton to drive a car similar to this B191 for the rest of the season]]

After his debut, he was signed by [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]]-[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] for the following race. Although Jordan had an agreement in principle with Schumacher's Mercedes management for the remainder of the season, they had not yet signed a contract. Jordan challenged Benetton in the UK courts, but lost the case.<ref>Collings, Timothy ''The Piranha Club'' Chapter 1 'Welcome to the Piranha Club' Virgin Books</ref> Schumacher finished the [[1991 Formula One Season|1991 season]] with four points in six races. His best result was a fifth in his second race, the [[1991 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]], where he also outpaced his teammate three-time World Champion [[Nelson Piquet]].

Schumacher became known as an up-and-coming driver in F1 as he claimed his first podium in the [[1992 Mexican Grand Prix]] and his first victory in the [[1992 Belgian Grand Prix]] at the [[Spa-Francorchamps]] circuit, which would become his favourite track.<ref name="schumacher hof" /> He finished third in the Drivers' Championship in {{F1|1992}} with 53 points, three behind the runner-up [[Riccardo Patrese]].

Benetton was not fully competitive in {{F1|1993}} with the more advanced and powerful [[Williams F1|Williams]] of Hill and Prost or the "loads of electronic trickery" found in the [[McLaren]] of Senna.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mclaren.com/historyofmclaren/timeline_90s.php|title= History of McLaren|accessdate= 2006-11-06|publisher = McLaren}}</ref> For the first part of the season the team also lacked the traction control used by other top teams.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr538.html|title= Grand Prix Results: Monaco GP, 1993|accessdate= 2006-11-06|work = Grand Prix Encyclopedia|publisher = GrandPrix.com}}</ref> Schumacher won one race, the [[1993 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portuguese Grand Prix]] and retired in seven of the other 15 races. He finished the season in fourth, with 52 points.

====1994 <U+2212> 1995====
Schumacher won his first [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' World Championship]] in {{F1|1994}} while driving for Benetton in a controversial season marred by allegations of cheating and the deaths of [[Ayrton Senna]] and [[Roland Ratzenberger]] at the [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]] at [[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari|Imola]].

Schumacher started the season strongly, winning six of the first seven races. His Benetton team, among others, was investigated on suspicion of breaking the [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]]-imposed ban on electronic aids. On investigation, the FIA discovered illegal software in the Benetton and other teams' cars, but no evidence that it had been used in a race. The teams investigated received little to no punishment.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.simhq.com/_motorsports/motorsports_018a.html|title= Senna: A Snapshot - May 1st, 1994|accessdate= 2006-11-08|publisher = SimHQ}}</ref>

At the [[1994 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]], Schumacher was penalised for overtaking on the formation lap.<ref name="f1-1994 British gp result">{{cite web | url=http://www.formula1.com/archive/grandprix/1994/107.html | title = 1994 British Grand Prix | accessdate = 2006-10-24| date = 2006| work = Results Archive| publisher = The Official Formula 1 Website}}</ref> He then ignored the penalty and the subsequent black flag during the race, for which he was disqualified and later given a two-race ban. Benetton blamed the fiasco on a communication error between the stewards and the team. Schumacher was also disqualified after winning the [[1994 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]] after his car was found to have illegal wear on its skidblock.<ref name="f1-1994 Belgian gp result">{{cite web | url = http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr559.html | title = Grand Prix Results: Belgian GP, 1994 | accessdate = 2006-05-13| date = | work = Grand Prix Encyclopedia | publisher = GrandPrix.com}}</ref> Benetton protested that the skidblock had been damaged when Schumacher spun over a kerb, but the FIA rejected their appeal. These incidents helped [[Damon Hill]] close the points gap. Leading by a single point going into the final race in [[1994 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]], Schumacher won first World Championship after colliding with Hill in a controversial incident, taking out both drivers. Schumacher became the first German to win the Formula One world championship.<ref name="firstgerman"/>

In {{F1|1995}}, Schumacher stayed with Benetton. He successfully defended his title, accumulating 33 more points than second-placed [[Damon Hill]], despite Hill having the superior vehicle.<ref name="dhill hof">{{cite web| url = http://www.formula1.com/archive/halloffame/driver/71.html | title = Damon Hill (GBR) World Champion - 1996| accessdate = 2006-10-24| date = 2006| work = Hall of Fame - World Champions | publisher = The Official Formula 1 Website}}</ref> With team-mate [[Johnny Herbert]], he took Benetton to its first [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors' Championship]]. He became the youngest double world champion in Formula One history, until Fernando Alonso beat the record in 2006.

During this season, the Benetton was not the best car in the field;<ref name="dhill hof" /> Nonetheless Schumacher won 9 out of the 17 races and finished on the podium 11 times. Only once did he qualify worse than fourth, at the [[1995 Belgian Grand Prix]], where he qualified 16th, but went on to win the race.<ref name="f1-1995 Belgian gp result"> {{cite web| url =http://www.formula1.com/archive/grandprix/1995/125.html  | title = 1995 Belgian Grand Prix | accessdate = 2006-10-24| date = 2006| work = Results Archive| publisher = The Official Formula 1 Website
}}</ref> After Schumacher left, Benetton would only win one more race before it was bought by Renault in 2000.

===Ferrari years===
In {{F1|1996}}, Schumacher signed with [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], then considered technologically and organisationally inferior to front running teams such as Benetton and Williams. Ferrari had not won the Drivers' Championship since [[Jody Scheckter]] in {{F1|1979}}. Various Ferraris since then had been labelled "a truck", "a pig", and "an accident waiting to happen" by their drivers, notably [[Alain Prost]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Switch the key to Ferrari revival | publisher = Telegraph Sport | date = 2006-10-20 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/core/Content/displayPrintable.jhtml?xml=/sport/2006/10/20/smbake20.xml&site=2&page=0 |first = Andrew |last = Baker |accessdate =2006-10-29 }}</ref> The poor performance of the Ferrari pit crews was considered a running joke.<ref name = superwheels"/> Schumacher is often credited along with [[Ross Brawn]], [[Rory Byrne]] and [[Jean Todt]] with turning this once struggling team into the most successful team in Formula One history.<ref>{{cite web | title = Schumacher confirms retirement | publisher = MSN Cars | date = 2006-09-11 | url = http://crashnet.cars.msn.co.uk/news_view.asp?cid=1&id=137166 | accessdate =2006-09-28 }}</ref> Triple World Champion [[Jackie Stewart]] believes the transformation of the Ferrari team was Schumacher's greatest feat.<ref name="stewart"/>

====1996 <U+2212> 1999====
In 1996 Schumacher finished third in the Drivers' Championship. He won three races, more than the team's total tally for the period from 1991 to 1995. The team's reliability troubles continued - Schumacher did not finish six of the 16 races. In the [[1996 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]] Schumacher qualified on pole position but suffered an engine failure on the formation lap.<ref name = "96frenchgp">{{cite news | title = Round 9: Renault Take Top Four Places At Home Grand Prix | publisher = AutoSport | date =  | url = http://atlasf1.autosport.com/96/fra/waller2.html |first = Toby |last = Waller | accessdate = 2006-11-02}}</ref>

Michael Schumacher and [[Jacques Villeneuve]] fought for the title in {{F1|1997}}. In the first part of the season, Villeneuve gained the advantage, driving the superior FW19.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.grandprix.com/race/r713fqreport.html| title = Friday Press Conference| accessdate = 2006-11-08| date =2003-10-10 | publisher = GrandPrix.com}}</ref> However, Schumacher led the Championship through the mid season, winning five races, and entered the last Grand Prix of the season at [[Circuito Permanente de Jerez|Jerez]] with a one point advantage over Villeneuve. During the race Schumacher and Villeneuve collided as the Canadian driver attempted to overtake. Schumacher retired from the race and Villeneuve scored four points to take the championship by three points. Schumacher was held to be at fault and was disqualified from the Drivers' Championship.<ref name="fia97verdict">{{cite news | title =

[[Image:Schu Hakk 98BritGP.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Schumacher battles with [[David Coulthard]] at the [[1998 British Grand Prix]].]]

[[Mika H<U+00E4>kkinen]] joined the list of Schumacher's rivals in {{F1|1998}}. H<U+00E4>kkinen won the first two races of the season, gaining a 16 point advantage over Schumacher. Schumacher won six races during the season, equalling the Finn with 80 points by the 14th of 16 races. H<U+00E4>kkinen won the last two races of the season and became World Champion. After a race-ending collision during the [[1998 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]], Schumacher stormed into the [[McLaren]] garage and accused H<U+00E4>kkinen's team mate [[David Coulthard]] of trying to kill him.<ref>{{cite news | title = Crash was my fault, Coulthard admits | publisher = Reuters  | date = 2003-06-07 | url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/06/1057430084085.html | accessdate = 2006-09-28 }}</ref> 

Schumacher's efforts helped Ferrari win the Constructors' title in {{F1|1999}}. His hopes for the Drivers' Championship were dashed at the [[1999 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]], where he broke his leg after a rear brake failure sent him off the circuit at the high speed ''Stowe Corner''.<ref name="broken leg"> {{cite news |title = Schumacher out of action |url = http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns02071.html  |work = |publisher = GrandPrix.com |date = 1999-07-12 |accessdate = 2006-10-25}}</ref> After missing six races, he assumed the role of a second driver, assisting team mate [[Eddie Irvine]]'s bid to win the Drivers' Championship for Ferrari. Irvine lost the title to H<U+00E4>kkinen in the last race, the [[1999 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]]. Schumacher would later say that H<U+00E4>kkinen was the opponent he respected the most.<ref name="hakkinen hof">{{cite web | title = Hall of Fame - World Champions: Mika Hakkinen | publisher = The Official Formula 1 Website | date = 2006 | url = http://www.formula1.com/archive/halloffame/driver/40.html | accessdate =2006-10-05}}</ref>

====2000 <U+2212> 2002====
In {{F1|2000}} Schumacher won his third World Championship after a hard-fought year-long battle with [[Mika H<U+00E4>kkinen]]. Schumacher won the first three races of the season, and five of the first eight. Midway through the year, three consecutive non-finishes, included being hit from behind at the first corner in [[2000 Austrian Grand Prix|Austria]] and [[2000 German Grand Prix|Germany]], allowed H<U+00E4>kkinen to close the gap in the championship standings. H<U+00E4>kkinen took another two victories before Schumacher won at the [[2000 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]]. At the post race press conference, Schumacher broke into tears when asked about his feelings on equalling his idol Ayrton Senna's record of 41 race wins.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://atlasf1.autosport.com/2000/ita/elizalde.html|title= The Italian GP Review|accessdate= 2006-11-02|publisher = AutoSport |first = Pablo |last = Elizalde}}</ref> The championship fight went down to the penultimate race in [[2000 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]]. Starting from pole position, Schumacher lost his lead to H<U+00E4>kkinen early in the race. He came out ahead of H<U+00E4>kkinen after his second pit-stop and went on to win the race and the Championship.

In {{F1|2001}}, Schumacher took his fourth drivers' title. Four other drivers won races, but none sustained a season-long challenge for the championship. Schumacher scored a record-tying nine wins and clinched the world championship with four races yet to run. He finished the championship with 123 points, 58 ahead of runner-up Coulthard. Season highlights included the [[2001 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]], where Schumacher finished 2nd to his brother Ralf, thus scoring the first ever 1-2 finish with two brothers and the [[2001 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]] where Schumacher scored his 52nd career win, breaking [[Alain Prost]]'s record for most career wins.

In {{F1|2002}}, a dominant year, Schumacher used the [[Ferrari F2002]] to retain his Drivers' Championship. In doing so he equalled the record set by [[Juan Manuel Fangio]] of 5 world championships. Ferrari won 15 out of 17 races and Schumacher won the title with six races remaining in the season. Schumacher also broke [[Nigel Mansell]]'s and his own record of nine race wins in a season, scoring 11 and finishing every race on the podium. He finished with 144 points, 60 head of runner-up team mate [[Rubens Barrichello]]. Schumacher and Barrichello finished 9 of the 17 races in the first two places.

[[Image:Michael_Schumacher_Ferrari_2004.jpg|thumb|250px|Schumacher at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|Indianapolis]] in 2004]]
Schumacher broke Juan Manuel Fangio's record for championship wins by winning the drivers' title for the sixth time in {{F1|2003}}, a closely contested season. The biggest competition came once again from the [[Team McLaren|McLaren Mercedes]] and [[Williams F1|BMW Williams]].

Schumacher won the [[2003 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]] and the next two races to close within two points of R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen. Aside from a victory in [[2003 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]], and Barrichello's victory in [[2003 British Grand Prix|Britain]], the mid-season was dominated by the Williams of Ralf Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya who each claimed two victories. After the [[2003 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungarian Grand Prix]] Michael Schumacher led [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] and [[Kimi R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen]] by only one and two points respectively. Ahead of the next race, the FIA declared illegal the front tyre design used by [[Michelin]], supplier to Williams and McLaren among others, for the previous two years.{{cn}} Michelin had to rapidly redesign their tyres before the [[2003 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]], where  Schumacher, running on Bridgestone tyres, took the first of two consecutive decisive, and extremely closely contested, wins. After Montoya was penalized in the [[2003 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]], only he and R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen remained in contention for the title. At the final round, the [[2003 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]], Schumacher needed only one point whilst R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen needed to win. The German driver took a single point for eighth place and won his sixth World Drivers' title, finishing two points ahead of R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen.

In {{F1|2004}}, Schumacher won a record twelve of the first thirteen races of the season, only failing to finish in Monaco after an accident with Juan Pablo Montoya during the [[safety car]] period. He clinched a record [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|seventh drivers' title]] at the [[2004 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]]. He would finish this season with a record 148 points, 34 points ahead of the runner-up, his team mate Rubens Barrichello, and a new record of 13 race wins out of 18 that season, surpassing his previous best of 11 in the [[2002 Formula One season|2002 season]].

In {{F1|2005}} Schumacher's sole win was at the [[2005 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]], a race contested by only six cars due to safety concerns about the Michelin tyres used by most teams. Over the season, Ferrari's Bridgestone tyres worked less well than their Michelin counterparts under new rules requiring tyres to last the whole race. According to the [[Associated Press]], the rule changes were intended to end the domination of Ferrari and Schumacher.{{fact}}<!--link broken<ref name="tire rules to end domination">{{cite news |first = Andrew |last = Dampf |title = Schumacher Wins Italy GP, Vows to Retire |url = http://interestalert.com/story/siteia.shtml?Story=st/sn/09100000aaa0466e.ap |work = |publisher = The Associated Press |date = 2006-09 |accessdate = 2006-10-25}}</ref>--> Less than half-way through the season, Schumacher said "I don't think I can count myself in this battle any more.

Schumacher retired in six of the 19 races. He finished the season in third with 62 points, less than half the points of the champion Fernando Alonso.
[[Image:Schumacher Suzuka2006.jpg|thumb|250px|Schumacher before the engine failure during the [[2006 Japanese Grand Prix]] that virtually destroyed his ambitions of becoming world champion for the 8th time.]]
{{F1|2006}} would become the last season of Schumacher's racing career. Although he did better than in 2005, it still was not enough and he lost the title to Fernando Alonso in the last race of the season. After three races, he had 11 points and was already 17 points behind Alonso. He won the two following races, which were his first wins in 18 months barring the boycott-marred [[2005 United States Grand Prix]]. His pole position at San Marino was his 66th, breaking Ayrton Senna's 12 year old record. By the [[2006 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]], the ninth race of the season he was 25 points behind Alonso, but the three wins that followed helped him reduce his disadvantage to 11. After two races where his advantage was increased by one point, the victories in [[2006 Italian Grand Prix|Italy]] and [[2006 Chinese Grand Prix|China]] made him the leader of the championship for the only time during the season. Although he and Alonso had the same points, Schumacher was in front because he had won more races. A series of misfortunes and problems would come and make him lose the title.

The Japanese Grand Prix saw Schumacher retiring after his first engine failure in five years with only 16 laps to go while leading the track. Alonso, who was behind him, would go on to win the race and almost the Championship, by getting a 10 point advantage before the last race of the season. The only way Schumacher could win the championship was if he won the race and if Alonso did not manage to score a single point. Schumacher himself conceded the title to Alonso after the race.<ref>{{cite news | title = Schumacher concedes title to Alonso | publisher = The Official Formula 1 Website | date = 2006-10-08 | url = http://www.formula1.com/race/news/5092/768.html | accessdate = 2006-10-23}}</ref>

In the last race, the [[2006 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazilian Grand Prix]], Schumacher finished fourth. Before the race he was awarded a trophy by football legend [[Pel<U+00E9>]] for his years of dedication to F1. During the qualifying session, he managed to get the best time of all drivers in the first two sessions, but a fuel pressure problem prevented him from completing a single lap during the third part, forcing him to start tenth. Schumacher managed to push forward early to the 6th position. However, after overtaking [[Giancarlo Fisichella]], teammate of Fernando Alonso, on lap 9, Schumacher experienced a puncture caused by the front wing of Fisichella's car.<ref>{{cite news | title = Fisi did cause Schu puncture | publisher = itv.com/f1 | date = 2006-10-23 | url = http://www.itv-f1.com/News_Article.aspx?PO_ID=37856 | accessdate = 2006-10-23}}</ref> Schumacher pitted and consequently fell to the 19th position and 70 seconds off team mate and race leader [[Felipe Massa]].

==Controversies and criticism==
During his long career Schumacher has been involved in several incidents which caused considerable controversy. Schumacher has been vilified in the British media for his involvement in title-deciding collisions in 1994 and 1997.<ref>{{cite news | title =

[[Image:Schumihill1994.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Schumacher (right) and Hill (left) crash at the ''Flinders Street'' corner during [[1994 Australian Grand Prix]]]]
Going into the [[1994 Australian Grand Prix]], the final race of the [[1994 Formula One season|1994 season]], Schumacher led [[Damon Hill]] by a single point in the Drivers' Championship. Schumacher led the race from the beginning, with Hill closely following him. On lap 20, Schumacher went off track, hitting a wall with his right side wheels.<ref name="autosportcrashes">{{cite news | title =

He returned to the track at reduced speed but still leading the race. At the next corner, Schumacher and Hill collided when Hill attempted a pass on the inside while Schumacher was turning into the corner. Schumacher's car was tipped up onto two wheels and eliminated on the spot. Hill pitted immediately and retired from the race with unrepairable damage. As neither driver scored, Schumacher took the title. British author [[Alan Henry]] claims Schumacher was blamed by 'many F1 insiders' for the incident.<ref>{{cite book | last = Henry | first = Alan | title = Wheel to Wheel: Great Duels of Formula One Racing | origyear = 1996 | accessdate = 2006-10-29 | edition = | publisher = Weidenfeld Nicolson Illustrated  | location =  | id = ISBN 0-7538-0522-7  | pages = 117}}</ref> The race stewards judged it a racing accident and took no action against either driver. The incident can be seen [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuirVZMI-Zc here] from various camera angles, as well as comments from the drivers themselves.

[[Image:Schumivilleneuve1997.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Michael Schumacher (red) and [[Jacques Villeneuve]] (blue) in the moment of the collision at the ''Dry Sack'' corner in the [[1997 European Grand Prix]] at [[Circuito Permanente de Jerez|Jerez]]]]
{{main|1997 European Grand Prix}}
At the [[1997 European Grand Prix]] at [[Circuito Permanente de Jerez|Jerez]], the last race of the [[1997 Formula One season|season]], Schumacher led Jacques Villeneuve by one point in the Drivers' Championship. Although Schumacher and Villeneuve had set the same time during qualifying, the Canadian driver started the race in pole position due to having set the time first. By the first corner of the race, Schumacher was ahead of Villeneuve. On lap 48, Villeneuve tried to overtake Schumacher at the Dry Sac Corner. Schumacher turned into Villeneuve, the right-front wheel of Schumacher's Ferrari hitting the left sidepod of Villeneuve's Williams. Schumacher retired from the race immediately while Villeneuve was able to finish the race in the third place, taking four points and so becoming the World Champion.<ref name="autosportcrashes"/>

Two weeks after the race, Schumacher was excluded from the results for the season after a [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] disciplinary hearing disqualified him, finding that his "manoeuvre was an instinctive reaction and although
deliberate not made with malice or premeditation. . It was a serious error."<ref name="fia97verdict" /> This made him the only driver in the history of the sport to be disqualified from a World Championship. Schumacher accepted the decision<ref name="schudisq">{{cite news | title =

===Other incidents===
{{main|1998 British Grand Prix}}
Two laps from the finish of the 1998 British Grand Prix, Michael Schumacher was leading the race when he was issued with a stop-and-go penalty for passing another driver under [[safety car]] period. The penalty involved going into the pit lane and stopping for 10 seconds before continuing the race. As it was given with less than 12 laps remaining, and due to the handwritten note used to notify Ferrari there was confusion as to whether the penalty was a 10s stop/go or 10 seconds to be added to his race time. Just before finishing the race, Schumacher turned into the pit lane and passed the finish line to end his race. Only after passing the finish lane Schumacher served the stop-and-go penalty.<ref>{{cite news | title =

[[Image:Austrian GP.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Rubens Barrichello]] makes way for Schumacher at the end of the [[2002 Austrian Grand Prix]]]]
During Schumacher's time at Ferrari, the team often employed [[team orders]] to benefit one of their drivers over the other. Usually Schumacher benefitted as team leader, although in 1999 he played a supporting role to [[Eddie Irvine]] after missing part of the season with a broken leg. Historically, team orders had always been permitted in Formula One. At the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix, Schumacher's teammate, Rubens Barrichello, took pole and led the race from the start. In the final metres of the race, the Brazilian driver, under orders from Ferrari, slowed his car to make way for Schumacher to pass and win the race.<ref name="bbcaustria">{{cite news | title =
