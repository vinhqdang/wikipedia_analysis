'''Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis''' ('''TPP''') is a condition featuring attacks of [[paralysis|muscle weakness]] in the presence of [[hyperthyroidism]] (overactivity of the [[thyroid]] gland). [[Hypokalemia]] (decreased [[potassium]] levels in the blood) is usually present during attacks. The condition may be life-threatening if weakness of the [[muscles of respiration|breathing muscles]] leads to [[respiratory failure]], or if the low potassium levels lead to [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s (irregularities in the heart rate).<ref name=Kung/><ref name=Pothiwala/> Untreated it is typically recurrent in nature.<ref name=Kung/>

The condition has been linked with [[genetic mutation]]s in genes that code for certain [[ion channel]]s that transport [[electrolyte]]s ([[sodium]] and [[potassium]]) across [[cell membrane]]s. The main ones are the [[Cav1.1|L-type calcium channel <U+03B1>1-subunit]]<ref name=Kung/> and [[Kir2.6|potassium inward rectifier 2.6]];<ref name=Ryan/> it is therefore classified as a [[channelopathy]].<ref name=Ryan/> The abnormality in the channel is thought to lead to shifts of potassium into [[cell (biology)|cells]] under conditions of high [[thyroxine]] (thyroid hormone) levels, usually with an additional precipitant. Treatment of the hypokalemia, followed by correction of the hyperthyroidism, leads to complete resolution of the attacks. It occurs predominantly in males of Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Korean descent.<ref name=Kung/> TPP is one of several conditions that can cause [[periodic paralysis]].<ref name=Fontaine>{{cite journal |author=Fontaine B |title=Periodic paralysis |journal=Adv.

==Signs and symptoms==
An attack often begins with muscle pain, cramping, and stiffness.<ref name=Mayo05/> This is then followed by weakness or paralysis that tends to develop rapidly, usually in the early hours of the morning or late evening; the weakness is usually symmetrical.<ref name=Mayo05/> The limb muscles closer to the trunk (proximal) are predominantly affected and weakness tends to start in the legs and spread to the arms. Muscles of the [[corticobulbar tract|mouth and throat]], [[Muscles of orbit|eyes]] and [[muscles of respiration|breathing]] are usually not affected, but occasionally weakness of the respiratory muscles can cause potentially life-threatening [[respiratory failure]]. Attacks typically resolve within several hours to several days, even in the absence of treatment.<ref name=Kung>{{cite journal |author=Kung AW |title=Clinical review: Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis: a diagnostic challenge |journal=J.

Attacks may be brought on by [[physical exercise|physical exertion]], drinking [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], or eating food high in [[carbohydrate]]s or [[salt]]. This may explain why attacks are more common in summer, when more people drink sugary drinks and engage in exercise. Exercise-related attacks tend to occur during a period of rest immediately after exercise; exercise may therefore be recommended to abort an attack.<ref name=Kung/>

There may be symptoms of thyroid overactivity, such as [[weight loss#Unintentional weight loss|weight loss]], [[tachycardia|a fast heart rate]], [[tremor]] and [[perspiration]],<ref name=Kung/><ref name=Pothiwala/> although only half report any of these symptoms.<ref name=Mayo05/> The most common type of hyperthyroidism, [[Graves' disease]], may additionally cause eye problems ([[Graves' ophthalmopathy]]) and skin changes of the legs ([[pretibial myxedema]]).<ref name=Weetman>{{cite journal |author=Weetman AP |title=Graves' disease |journal=N.

==Causes==
===Genetics===
Genetic mutations in the L-type calcium channel <U+03B1>1-subunit (Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1) have been described in Southern Chinese with TPP. The mutations are located in a different part of the gene from those described in the related condition [[familial periodic paralysis]]. In TPP, the mutations described are [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s located in the [[hormone response element]] responsive to thyroid hormone, implying that [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of the gene and production of ion channels may be altered by increased thyroid hormone levels. Furthermore, mutations have been reported in the genes coding for [[KCNC4|potassium voltage-gated channel, Shaw-related subfamily, member 4]] (K<sub>v</sub>3.4) and [[Nav1.4|sodium channel protein type 4 subunit alpha]] (Na<sub>4</sub>1.4).<ref name=Kung/>

Of people with TPP, 33% from various populations were demonstrated to have mutations in ''KCNJ18'', the gene coding for K<sub>ir</sub>2.6, an [[inward-rectifier potassium ion channel]]. This gene, too, harbors a thyroid response element.<ref name=Ryan>{{cite journal |author=Ryan DP, Pt<U+00E1>cek LJ |title=Episodic neurological channelopathies |journal=Neuron |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=282<U+2013>92 |year=2010 |month=October |pmid=20955935 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2010.10.008}}</ref>

Certain forms of [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA), especially B46, DR9, DQB1*0303, A2, Bw22, AW19, B17 and DRW8, have been found to be more common in TPP. Linkage to particular forms of HLA, which plays a central role in the [[immune system|immune response]], might imply an immune system cause, but it is uncertain whether this directly causes TPP or whether it increases the susceptibility to Graves' disease, a known [[autoimmune disease]].<ref name=Kung/>

===Thyroid disease===
The most common underlying form of thyroid disease associated with TPP is Graves' disease, a syndrome due to an [[Autoimmunity|autoimmune reaction]] that leads to overproduction of thyroid hormone.<ref name=Weetman/> TPP has also been described in people with other thyroid problems such as [[thyroiditis]], [[toxic nodular goitre|toxic nodular goiter]], [[thyroid adenoma|toxic adenoma]], [[thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]]-producing [[pituitary adenoma]], excessive ingestion of [[thyroxine]] or [[iodine]],<ref name=Kung/> and [[amiodarone]]-induced hyperthyroidism.<ref name=Pothiwala/>

==Mechanism==
[[File:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en-2.svg|framed|alt=An image of the cell membrane lipid bilayer with the sodium-potassium ATPase enzyme keeping potassium inside and the sodium out. This process requires the energy molecule ATP.|Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase maintains the normal gradients of sodium and potassium between cells and extracellular fluid, expending the cellular fuel [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] in doing so.]]
The muscle weakness and increased risk of irregular heart beat in TPP result from markedly reduced levels of potassium in the bloodstream. Potassium is not in fact lost from the body, but increased [[Na+/K+-ATPase|Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase]] activity (the [[enzyme]] that moves potassium into cells and keeps [[sodium]] in the blood) leads to shift of potassium into tissues and depletion from the circulation. In other types of potassium derangement, the [[acid-base homeostasis|acid-base balance]] is usually disturbed, with [[metabolic alkalosis]] and [[metabolic acidosis]] often being present. In TPP, these disturbances are generally absent. Hypokalemia leads to [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]] of [[skeletal muscle|muscle cells]], making the [[neuromuscular junction]] less responsive to normal nerve impulses and leading to decreased contractility of the muscles.<ref name=Kung/>

It is not clear how the described genetic defects increase the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity. It is suspected that the enzyme becomes more active due to increased thyroid hormone levels. Hyperthyroidism increases the levels of [[catecholamine]]s (such as [[adrenaline]]) in the blood, increasing Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity.<ref name=Mayo05/> The enzyme activity is then increased further by the precipitating causes. For instance, increased carbohydrate intake leads to increased [[insulin]] levels; this is known to activate Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Once the precipitant is removed, the enzyme activity returns to normal levels.<ref name=Kung/> It has been postulated that [[androgen|male hormones]] increase Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity, and that this explains why males are at a higher risk of TPP despite thyroid disease being more common in females.<ref name=Pothiwala/>

TPP is regarded as a model for other related conditions, known as "channelopathies", which have been linked with mutations in ion channels; the majority of these conditions occurs episodically.<ref name=Ryan/>

==Diagnosis==
[[Hypokalaemia]] (low blood [[potassium]] levels) commonly occurs during attacks; levels below 3.0&nbsp;mmol/l are typically encountered. [[Magnesium]] and [[phosphate]] levels are often found to be decreased. [[Creatine kinase]] levels are elevated in two thirds of cases, usually due to a degree of muscle injury; severe elevations suggestive of [[rhabdomyolysis]] (severe muscle tissue destruction) are rare.<ref name=Kung/><ref name=Pothiwala/> [[Electrocardiography]] (ECG/EKG) may show [[tachycardia]] (a fast heart rate) due to the thyroid disease, abnormalities due to cardiac arrhythmia ([[atrial fibrillation]], [[ventricular tachycardia]]), and conduction changes associated with hypokalemia (U waves, QRS widening, QT prolongation and T wave flattening).<ref name=Pothiwala/> [[Electromyography]] shows changes similar to those encountered in [[myopathy|myopathies]] (muscle diseases), with a reduced amplitude of the [[compound muscle action potential]]s (CMAPs);<ref name=Fontaine/> they resolve when treatment has commenced.<ref name=Kung/>

TPP is distinguished from other forms of periodic paralysis (especially [[hypokalemic periodic paralysis]]) with [[thyroid function test]]s on the blood. These are normal in the other forms, and in [[thyrotoxicosis]] the levels of [[thyroxine]] and [[triiodothyronine]] are elevated, with resultant suppression of TSH production by the [[pituitary gland]].<ref name=Kung/><ref name=Weetman/> Various other investigations are usually performed to separate the different causes of hyperthyroidism.<ref name=Weetman/>

==Treatment==
[[Image:Propranolol-2D-skeletal.png|right|thumb|alt=Structural formula of propranolol, which is commonly used in the treatment of TPP|The non-selective beta blocker propranolol can rapidly improve the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including attacks of TPP.]]
In the acute phase of an attack, administration of [[potassium]] usually rapidly improve the muscle weakness and prevents complications. However, caution is advised as the total amount of potassium in the body is not decreased, and it is possible for potassium levels to overshoot ("rebound [[hyperkalemia]]"); slow infusions of potassium chloride are therefore recommended while other treatment is commenced.<ref name=Kung/>

The effects of excess thyroid hormone typically respond to the administration of a non-selective [[beta blocker]], such as [[propranolol]] (as most of the symptoms are driven by increased levels of adrenaline and its effect on the [[Adrenergic receptor#<U+03B2> receptors|<U+03B2>-adrenergic receptors]]). Furthermore, further attacks may be prevented by avoiding known precipitants such as high salt or carbohydrate intake until the thyroid disease has been adequately treated.<ref name=Kung/>

Treatment of the thyroid disease usually leads to resolution of the paralysis attacks. Depending on the nature of the disease, the treatment may consist of [[Hyperthyroidism#Thyrostatics_.28antithyroid_drugs.29|thyrostatics]] (drugs that reduce production of thyroid hormone), [[radioiodine]], and occasionally thyroid surgery.<ref name=Kung/><ref name=Pothiwala/>

==Epidemiology==
TPP occurs predominantly in [[male]]s of Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Korean descent,<ref name=Kung/> as well as [[Thailand|Thais]],<ref name=Ryan/> with much lower rates in people of other ethnicities.<ref name=Kung/> In Chinese and Japanese people with hyperthyroidism, 1.8<U+2013>1.9% experience TPP. This is in contrast to North America, where studies reported a rate of 0.1<U+2013>0.2%.<ref name=Kung/><ref name=Pothiwala/> [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who share a genetic background with Southeast Asians, have also been found to be at an increased risk.<ref name=Kung/>

The average age of onset is 20<U+2013>40. It is unknown why males are predominantly affected, with rates in males being 17- to 70-fold those in females, despite thyroid overactivity being much more common in women.<ref name=Kung/><ref name=Pothiwala/>

[[Image:Westphal.jpg|right|thumb|Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal]]
After several case reports in the 18th and 19th century, the entity of periodic paralysis was first described in full by the German neurologist [[Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal]] (1833<U+2013>1890).<ref>{{cite journal | author=Westphal CF | title=<U+00DC>ber einen merkw<U+00FC>rdigen Fall von periodischer L<U+00E4>hmung aller vier Extremit<U+00E4>ten mit gleichzeitigem Erl<U+00F6>schen der elektrischen Erregbarkeit w<U+00E4>hrend der L<U+00E4>hmung | year=1885 | journal=Berl.
