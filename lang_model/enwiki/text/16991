13 November 354 <U+2013> 28 August 430), also known as '''Saint Augustine''' or '''Saint Austin''',<ref>{{cite book |title=The American Heritage College Dictionary |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin Company]] |location=Boston, MA |year=1997 |isbn=0-395-66917-0 |page=91}}</ref> was an early Christian [[theologian]] and [[philosopher]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Mendelson|first=Michael|title=Saint Augustine|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/augustine/|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=21 December 2012}}</ref>  whose writings were very influential in the development of [[Western Christianity]] and [[Western philosophy]]. He was [[bishop]] of [[Hippo Regius]] (present-day [[Annaba]], Algeria) located in the [[Roman province]] of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]]. Writing during the [[Patristics|Patristic Era]], he is viewed as one of the most important [[Church Fathers]] in the [[Western Christianity|West]]. Among his most important works are ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' and ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'', which continue to be read widely today.

According to his contemporary, [[Jerome]], Augustine "established anew the ancient Faith."<ref>[[Jerome]] wrote to Augustine in 418: "You are known throughout the world; Catholics honour and esteem you as the one who has established anew the ancient Faith" (''conditor antiquae rursum fidei'').

When the [[Western Roman Empire]] began to disintegrate, Augustine developed the concept of the [[Catholicism|Catholic Church]] as a spiritual [[New Jerusalem#Christianity|City of God]] (in [[City of God (book)|a book of the same name]]), distinct from the material Earthly City.<ref name="CC">{{cite book |last=Durant |first=Will |title=Caesar and Christ: a History of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] Civilization and of Christianity from Their Beginnings to A.D. 325 |publisher=MJF Books |location=New York |year=1992 |isbn=1-56731-014-1 |authorlink=Will Durant}}</ref> His thoughts profoundly influenced the medieval worldview. Augustine's ''City of God'' was closely identified with the segment of the Church that adhered to the concept of the [[Trinity]] as defined by the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] and the [[First Council of Constantinople|Council of Constantinople]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Wilken |first=Robert L. |title=The Spirit of Early Christian Thought |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |location=New Haven |year=2003 |isbn=0-300-10598-3 |page=291}}</ref>

In the Catholic Church and the [[Anglican Communion]], he is a saint, a pre-eminent [[Doctor of the Church]], and the patron of the [[Augustinians]]. His memorial is celebrated on 28 August, the day of his death. He is the [[patron saint]] of brewers, printers, theologians, the alleviation of sore eyes, and a number of cities and dioceses.<ref name="KnoYrSaint">[http://www.catholicapologetics.info/library/saints/index.htm Know Your Patron Saint]. catholicapologetics.info</ref> Many [[Protestantism|Protestants]], especially [[Calvinism|Calvinists]], consider him to be one of the theological fathers of the [[Protestant Reformation]] due to his teachings on [[salvation]] and [[divine grace]].

In the [[Eastern Christianity|East]], many of his teachings are not accepted.

===Childhood and education===
[[File:Augustine at the school of taghaste.jpg|thumb|''Augustine at the School of Souk Ahras,Thagaste" by [[Benozzo Gozzoli]]]]
Augustine was born in 354 in the [[municipium]] of  Thagaste (now [[Souk Ahras]], [[Algeria]]) in [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]].<ref>[[Paul MacKendrick|MacKendrick, Paul]]  (1980) ''The North African Stones Speak'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, p. 326, ISBN 0709903944.</ref><ref>[[Everett Ferguson|Ferguson, Everett]] (1998) ''Encyclopedia of Early Christianity'', Taylor & Francis, p. 776, ISBN 0815333196.</ref> His mother, [[Saint Monica|Monica]], was a devout Christian; his father Patricius was a Pagan who converted to Christianity on his deathbed.<ref>Vesey, Mark, trans.

Augustine's family had been Roman, from a legal standpoint, for at least a century when he was born.<ref>Lancel, Serge (2002) ''Saint Augustine'', Hymns Ancient & Modern, p. 5, ISBN 0334028663.</ref> It is assumed that his mother, Monica, was of Berber origin, on the basis of her name,<ref name="KP"/><ref>Michael Brett and Elizabeth Fentress, ''The Berbers'', Wiley-Blackwell, 1997, pp. 71, 293</ref> but as his family were ''[[Decurion (administrative)|honestiores]]'', an upper class of citizens known as honorable men, Augustine's first language is likely to have been Latin.<ref name="KP"/> At the age of 11, he was sent to school at Madaurus (now [[M'Daourouch]]), a small [[Numidia]]n city about 19 miles south of Thagaste. There he became familiar with [[Latin literature]], as well as pagan beliefs and practices.<ref>Andrew Knowles and Pachomios Penkett, ''Augustine and his World'' Ch. 2.</ref> His first insight into the nature of sin occurred when he and a number of friends stole fruit they did not even want from a neighborhood garden. While at home in 369 and 370, he read [[Cicero]]'s [[dialogue]] ''[[Hortensius (Cicero)|Hortensius]]'' (now lost), which he described as leaving a lasting impression on him and sparking his interest in philosophy.<ref name=EA>''Encyclopedia Americana'', v. 2, p. 685. Danbury, CT: Grolier, 1997. ISBN 0-7172-0129-5.</ref>

At the age of 17, through the generosity of his fellow citizen Romanianus,<ref name=EA/> Augustine went to [[Carthage]] to continue his education in [[rhetoric]]. Although raised as a Christian, Augustine left the church to follow the [[Manichaeism|Manichaean religion]], much to the despair of his mother.<ref>{{cite web| last= Pope | first = Hugh | work =Catholic Encyclopedia | title = Saint Monica| url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10482a.htm | accessdate = 20 April 2012|quote= At Carthage Augustine had become a Manichaean and when on his return home he ventilated certain heretical propositions she drove him away from her table, but a strange vision which she had urged her to recall him.

At about the age of 19, Augustine began an affair with a young woman in Carthage. Possibly because his mother wanted him to marry a person of his class, the woman remained his lover<ref name=Uta>{{cite book |title= Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven: Women, Sexuality and the Catholic Church | last =Ranke-Heineman | first = Uta|publisher= Penguin Books | place = US |year=1988|isbn=9780385265270}}</ref> for over thirteen years and gave birth to his son Adeodatus,<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 4:2</ref> who was viewed as extremely intelligent by his contemporaries.<ref>{{cite web |last= A'Becket|first= John| work =Catholic Encyclopedia | title = Adeodatus|url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01141e.htm |accessdate=20 April 2012|quote=Seeing the wonderful intelligence of his son, Augustine felt a sort of awe.

===Teaching rhetoric===
During the years 373 and 374, Augustine taught grammar at Thagaste. The following year he moved to Carthage to conduct a school of rhetoric, and would remain there for the next nine years.<ref name=EA/> Disturbed by the unruly behavior of the students in Carthage, in 383 he moved to establish a school in Rome, where he believed the best and brightest rhetoricians practiced. However, Augustine was disappointed with the Roman schools, where he was met with apathy. Once the time came for his students to pay their fees, they simply fled. Manichaean friends introduced him to the prefect of the City of Rome, [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus|Symmachus]], who had been asked to provide a professor of rhetoric for the imperial court at [[Milan]].<ref name="celife" />
[[File:Saint Augustine and Saint Monica.jpg|left|thumb|''Saint Augustine and [[Saint Monica]]'' (1846), by [[Ary Scheffer]]]]

Augustine won the job and headed north to take up his position in late 384. At the age of thirty, he had won the most visible academic position in the Latin world, at a time when such posts gave ready access to political careers. During this period, although Augustine showed some fervor for Manichaeism, he was never an initiate or "elect", but remained an "auditor", the lowest level in the sect's hierarchy.<ref name = "celife" />

While still at Carthage, he had begun to move away from Manichaeism, in part because of a disappointing meeting with the Manichaean Bishop, [[Faustus of Mileve]], a key exponent of Manichaean theology.<ref name="celife"/> In Rome, he is reported to have completely turned away from Manichaeanism, and instead embraced the [[Philosophical scepticism|scepticism]] of the [[Platonic Academy#New Academy|New Academy]] movement. At Milan, his mother pressured him to become a Christian. Augustine's own studies in [[Neoplatonism]] were also leading him in this direction, and his friend [[Simplician|Simplicianus]] urged him that way as well.<ref name= EA/> But it was the bishop of Milan, [[Ambrose]], who had most influence over Augustine. Like Augustine, Ambrose was a master of rhetoric, but older and more experienced.<ref name = "BeDuhn2009">{{cite book | first = Jason David | last = BeDuhn | title = Augustine's Manichaean dilemma: Conversion and apostasy, 373<U+2013>388 C.E. | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=mEmZaq1Gg3wC&pg=PA163 | accessdate = 17 June 2011 | date =28 October 2009|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-4210-2|page= 163}}</ref>

Augustine's mother had followed him to Milan and he allowed her to arrange a marriage, for which he abandoned his concubine. It is believed that Augustine truly loved the woman he had lived with for so long and was deeply hurt by ending this relationship. In fact, there is evidence that Augustine may have considered his relationship with the concubine to be equivalent to marriage, though not legally recognized as such.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Burrus | first=Virginia|year=2011|title="Fleeing the Uxorious Kingdom": Augustine's Queer Theology of Marriage | journal =Journal of Early Christian Studies|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|volume=19|issue=1|pages = 1<U+2013>20|doi=10.1353/earl.2011.0002}}</ref> In his ''Confessions,'' he admitted that the experience eventually produced a decreased sensitivity to pain over time. He had to wait two years until his fianc<U+00E9>e came of age, and he soon took another concubine. Augustine eventually broke off his engagement to his eleven-year-old fianc<U+00E9>e, but never renewed his relationship with either of his concubines.

[[Alypius of Thagaste]] steered Augustine away from marriage, saying that they could not live a life together in the love of wisdom if he married.  Augustine looked back years later on the life at [[Cassago Brianza|Cassiciacum]], a villa outside of Milan where he gathered with his followers, and described it as ''Christianae vitae otium'' <U+2013> the Christian life of leisure.<ref name="Ferguson208">Ferguson, Everett (1999) ''Christianity in relation to Jews, Greeks, and Romans'', Taylor & Francis, p. 208, ISBN 0-8153-3069-3.</ref> Augustine had been awarded a job of professor of rhetoric in Milan at the time he was living at Cassiciacum around 383.

=== Christian conversion and priesthood ===
[[File:Fra angelico - conversion de saint augustin.jpg|thumb|{{Cite journal | title = The Conversion of St. Augustine | type = painting | first = Fra | last = Angelico | author-link = Fra Angelico}}]]
In the summer of 386, after having heard and been inspired and moved by the story of Placianus's and his friends' first reading of the life of [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony of the Desert]], Augustine converted to Christianity.  As Augustine later told it, his conversion was prompted by a childlike voice he heard telling him to "take up and read" ({{lang-la|tolle, lege}}), which he took as a divine command to open the Bible and read the first thing he saw. Augustine read from [[Epistle to the Romans|Paul's Epistle to the Romans]] <U+2013> the so-called "''[[Epistle to the Romans#Transformation of believers (12<U+2013>15:13)|Transformation of Believers]]''" section, consisting of chapters 12 through 15 <U+2013> wherein Paul outlines how the Gospel transforms believers, and the believers' resulting behaviour. The specific part to which Augustine opened his Bible was Romans chapter 13, verses 13 and 14, to wit:
{{Quote |Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying, but put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof.<ref>{{cite book| author = Augustine of Hippo | title = Confessions |year= 2008| publisher= Oxford University Press| place = New York | pages =152<U+2013>53 | others = Chadwick, Henry transl}}</ref>}}

He later wrote an account of his conversion <U+2013> his very transformation, as Paul described <U+2013> in his ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' ({{lang-la|Confessiones}}), which has since become a must-read classic of Christian theology.

Ambrose baptized Augustine, along with his son Adeodatus, on [[Easter Vigil]] in 387 in Milan.  A year later, in 388, Augustine completed his [[Christian apologetics|apology]] ''On the Holiness of the Catholic Church''.<ref name="celife"/> That year, also, Adeodatus and Augustine returned to Africa,<ref name=EA/> Augustine's home continent. Augustine's mother Monica died at Ostia, Italy, as they prepared to embark for Africa. <ref>{{cite web|last=Pope|first=Hugh| work = Catholic Encyclopedia | title = Saint Monica|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10482a.htm|accessdate=20 April 2012|quote=Here death overtook Monica and the finest pages of his "Confessions" were penned as the result of the emotion Augustine then experienced.}}</ref> Upon their arrival, they began a life of aristocratic leisure at Augustine's family's property.<ref>Possidius, ''v.

The only thing he kept was the family house, which he converted into a [[monastic]] foundation for himself and a group of friends.<ref name=EA/>

In 391 Augustine was [[ordination|ordained]] a [[priest]] in [[Hippo Regius]] (now [[Annaba]]), in [[Algeria]]. He became a famous [[preacher]] (more than 350 preserved sermons are believed to be authentic), and was noted for combating the Manichaean religion, to which he had formerly adhered.<ref name="celife">Portali<U+00E9>, Eug<U+00E8>ne.

In 395 he was made [[coadjutor Bishop]] of Hippo, and became full Bishop shortly thereafter,<ref>Brown, Peter (2000) ''Augustine of Hippo: A Biography'', Berkeley: University of California Press, ISBN 0520227573.</ref> hence the name "Augustine of Hippo"; and he gave his property to the church of Thagaste.<ref>Augustine, ''ep.''126.1</ref> He remained in that position until his death in 430. He wrote his autobiographical ''Confessions'' in 397-398. His work ''The City of God'' was written to console his fellow Christians shortly after the [[Visigoths]] had [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacked Rome in 410]].

Augustine worked tirelessly in trying to convince the people of Hippo to convert to Christianity. Though he had left his monastery, he continued to lead a monastic life in the episcopal residence. He left a ''[[Monastic rule|regula]]'' for his monastery that led to his designation as the "[[patron saint]] of [[regular clergy]]."<ref>[http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-augustine-of-hippo/ Saint Augustine of Hippo] at ''saints.sqpn.com''. Retrieved 30 September 2011</ref>

Much of Augustine's later life was recorded by his friend [[Possidius]], bishop of [[Calama (titular see)|Calama]] (present-day [[Guelma]], Algeria), in his ''Sancti Augustini Vita''. Possidius admired Augustine as a man of powerful intellect and a stirring orator who took every opportunity to defend Christianity against its detractors. Possidius also described Augustine's personal traits in detail, drawing a portrait of a man who ate sparingly, worked tirelessly, despised gossip, shunned the temptations of the flesh, and exercised prudence in the financial stewardship of his see.<ref>[[#Weiskotten|Weiskotten]]</ref>

Shortly before Augustine's death the [[Vandals]], a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribe that had converted to [[Arianism]], invaded [[Roman Africa]]. The Vandals besieged Hippo in the spring of 430, when Augustine entered his final illness. According to Possidius, one of the few miracles attributed to Augustine, the healing of an ill man, took place during the siege.<ref>[[#Weiskotten|Weiskotten]], p. 43</ref> According to Possidius, Augustine spent his final days in prayer and repentance, requesting that the penitential [[Psalms|Psalms of David]] be hung on his walls so that he could read them. He directed that the library of the church in Hippo and all the books therein should be carefully preserved. He died on 28 August 430.<ref>[[#Weiskotten|Weiskotten]], p. 57</ref> Shortly after his death, the Vandals lifted the siege of Hippo, but they returned not long thereafter and burned the city. They destroyed all of it but Augustine's cathedral and library, which they left untouched.<ref>[http://www.philosophybasics.com/philosophers_augustine.html "St Augustine of Hippo"] at ''PhilosophyBasics.com''.

He is considered the patron saint of brewers, printers, theologians, sore eyes, and a number of cities and dioceses.<ref name="KnoYrSaint"/>

====Relics====
According to [[Bede|Bede's]] ''True Martyrology'', Augustine's body was later [[Translation (relic)|translated]] or moved to [[Cagliari]], [[Sardinia]], by the Catholic bishops expelled from North Africa by [[Huneric]]. Around 720, his remains were translated again by Peter, bishop of [[Pavia]] and uncle of the Lombard king [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]], to the church of [[San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro]] in Pavia, in order to save them from frequent coastal raids by [[Muslim]]s. In January 1327, [[Pope John XXII]] issued the papal bull ''Veneranda Santorum Patrum'', in which he appointed the [[Augustinians]] guardians of the tomb of Augustine, which was remade in 1362 and elaborately carved with bas-reliefs of scenes from Augustine's life.

In October 1695, some workmen in the Church of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro in Pavia discovered a marble box containing some human bones (including part of a skull). A dispute arose between the Augustinian hermits (Order of Saint Augustine) and the regular canons (Canons Regular of Saint Augustine) as to whether these were the bones of St. Augustine. The hermits did not believe so; the canons affirmed that they were. Eventually Pope Benedict XIII (1724&ndash;1730) directed the Bishop of Pavia, Monsignor Pertusati, to make a determination. The bishop declared that, in his opinion, the bones were those of Saint Augustine.<ref>[http://www.augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=2213&iparentid=145 Augustine's tomb, Augnet]</ref>

The Augustinians were expelled from Pavia in 1700, taking refuge in [[Milan]] with the relics of Augustine, and the disassembled Arca, which were removed to the cathedral there. San Pietro fell into disrepair, but was finally rebuilt in the 1870s, under the urging of [[Agostino Gaetano Riboldi]], and reconsecrated in 1896 when the relics of Augustine and the shrine were once again reinstalled.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Dale, Shanon |title=A house divided: San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro in Pavia and the politics of Pope John XXII|doi=10.1016/S0304-4181(00)00016-6|year=2001|journal=Journal of Medieval History|volume=27|pages=55}}</ref><ref>Stone, Harold Samuel (2002) ''St. Augustine's Bones: A Microhistory'' (Studies in Print Culture and the History of the Book) Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], ISBN 1558493883.</ref>

===Christian Anthropology===
Augustine was one of the first Christian [[Late Latin|ancient Latin]] authors with a very clear vision of [[Christian anthropology|theological anthropology]].<ref>{{Cite journal | publisher = Stanford | title = Encyclopedia of Philosophy | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/augustine/#PhiAnt | contribution = Augustine | accessdate = 23 March 2011}}</ref> He saw the human being as a perfect unity of two substances: soul and body. In his late treatise ''[[s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series I/Volume III/Moral Treatises of St. Augustin/On Care to Be Had for the Dead/Section 5|On Care to Be Had for the Dead, section 5]]'' (420 AD) he exhorted to respect the body on the grounds that it belonged to the very nature of the human [[person]].<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''De cura pro mortuis gerenda'' [[Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum|CSEL]] 41, 627[13<U+2013>22]; PL 40, 595: ''Nullo modo ipsa spernenda sunt corpora. (...)Haec enim non ad ornamentum vel adiutorium, quod adhibetur extrinsecus, sed ad ipsam naturam hominis pertinent''.</ref> Augustine's favourite figure to describe ''body-soul'' unity is [[marriage]]: ''caro tua, coniunx tua <U+2014> your body is your wife''.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Enarrationes in psalmos'', 143, 6.</ref><ref>[[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 40, 2077 [46] <U+2013> 2078 [74]; 46, 234<U+2013>35.</ref><ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''De utilitate ieiunii'', 4,4<U+2013>5.</ref> Initially, the two elements were in perfect harmony. After the [[Augustine of Hippo#Original sin|fall of humanity]] they are now experiencing dramatic combat between one another. They are two categorically different things. The body is a three-dimensional object composed of the four elements, whereas the soul has no spatial dimensions.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''De quantitate animae'' 1.2; 5.9.</ref> Soul is a kind of substance, participating in reason, fit for ruling the body.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''De quantitate animae'' 13.12: ''Substantia quaedam rationis particeps, regendo corpori accomodata''.</ref>  Augustine was not preoccupied, as [[Plato]] and [[Descartes]] were, with going too much into details in efforts to explain the [[metaphysics]] of the soul-body union. It sufficed for him to admit that they are metaphysically distinct: to be a human is to be a composite of soul and body, and the soul is superior to the body.  The latter statement is grounded in his hierarchical classification of things into those that merely exist, those that exist and live, and those that exist, live, and have intelligence or reason.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''On the free will'' (''De libero arbitrio'') 2.3.7<U+2013>6.13.</ref><ref>{{Cite book | first = WE | last = Mann | contribution = Inner-Life Ethics | title=The Augustinian Tradition | publisher=University of California Press | year=1999 | pages=141<U+2013>42 | isbn=0-520-20999-0 | editor-first = GB | editor-last = Matthews}}</ref>

===Astrology===
Augustine's contemporaries often believed astrology to be an exact and genuine science. Its practitioners were regarded as true men of learning and called ''mathemathici''. Astrology played a prominent part in Manichaean doctrine, and Augustine himself was attracted by their books in his youth, being particularly fascinated by those who claimed to foretell the future. Later, as a bishop, he used to warn that one should avoid astrologers who combine science and horoscopes. (Augustine's term "mathematici", meaning "astrologers",  is sometimes mistranslated as "mathematicians".) According to Augustine, they were not genuine students of [[Hipparchus]] or [[Eratosthenes]] but "common swindlers".<ref>{{cite book | title = Augustine the Bishop.

===Creation===
{{See also|Allegorical interpretations of Genesis}}
In ''City of God'', Augustine rejected both the immortality of the human race proposed by pagans, and contemporary ideas of ages (such as those of certain Greeks and Egyptians) that differed from the Church's sacred writings.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF1-02/npnf1-02-18.htm#P2017_1154484 Of the Falseness of the History Which Allots Many Thousand Years to the World's Past], ''The City of God'', Book 12: Chapt. 10 [419].</ref> In ''The Literal Interpretation of Genesis'', Augustine took the view that everything in the universe was created simultaneously by God, and not in seven calendar days like a literal account of Genesis would require. He argued that the six-day structure of creation presented in the book of Genesis represents a [[framework interpretation (Genesis)|logical framework]], rather than the passage of time in a physical way <U+2014> it would bear a spiritual, rather than physical, meaning, which is no less literal.  One reason for this interpretation is the passage in [[Sirach]] 18:1, ''creavit omni simul'' ("He created all things at once"), which Augustine took as proof that the days of Genesis 1 had to be taken non-literally.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Wm B Eerdmans | isbn = 978-0-8028-3843-8 | pages = 377<U+2013>78 | editor-first = Allan D | editor-last = Fitzgerald | last = Teske| first = Roland J | title = Genesi ad litteram liber imperfectus, De| encyclopedia = Augustine Through the Ages: An Encyclopedia| year = 1999}}</ref> Augustine also does not envision original sin as causing structural changes in the universe, and even suggests that the bodies of Adam and Eve were already created mortal before the Fall.<ref>On the Merits, 1.2; City of God, 13:1; Enchiridion, 104</ref> Apart from his specific views, Augustine recognizes that the interpretation of the creation story is difficult, and remarks that we should be willing to change our mind about it as new information comes up.<ref>Young, Davis A.

===Ecclesiology===
{{See also|Ecclesiology}}
[[File:Carlo Crivelli - St. Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|150px|''St. Augustine'' by [[Carlo Crivelli]]]]
Augustine developed his doctrine of the Church principally in reaction to the [[Donatist]] sect. He taught that there is one Church, but that within this Church there are two realities, namely, the visible aspect (the institutional [[Catholic hierarchy|hierarchy]], the [[Catholic sacraments|sacraments]], and the laity) and the invisible (the souls of those in the Church, who are either dead, sinful members or elect predestined for Heaven). The former is the institutional body established by Christ on earth which proclaims salvation and administers the [[sacraments]] while the latter is the invisible body of the elect, made up of genuine believers from all ages, and who are known only to God. The Church, which is visible and societal, will be made up of "wheat" and "tares", that is, good and wicked people (as per Mat. 13:30), until the end of time. This concept countered the Donatist claim that only those in a [[state (theology)|state of grace]] were the "true" or "pure" church on earth, and that priests and bishops who were not in a state of grace had no authority or ability to confect the sacraments.<ref name="Gonzalez">{{cite book

| title=A History of Christian Thought: Volume 2 (From Augustine to the eve of the Reformation)
| publisher=Abingdon Press|isbn=0687171830
| date=1970<U+2013>1975}}</ref>{{rp|28}}
Augustine's ecclesiology was more fully developed in ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]''. There he conceives of the church as a heavenly city or kingdom, ruled by love, which will ultimately triumph over all earthly empires which are self-indulgent and ruled by pride. Augustine followed [[Cyprian]] in teaching that the bishops and priests of the Church are the [[apostolic succession|successors of the Apostles]],<ref name="Gonzalez"/> and that their authority in the Church is God-given.

===Eschatology===
Augustine originally believed in [[premillennialism]], namely that Christ would establish a literal 1,000-year kingdom prior to the general [[resurrection]], but later rejected the belief, viewing it as carnal. He was the first theologian to expound a systematic doctrine of [[amillennialism]], although some theologians and Christian historians believe his position was closer to that of modern [[postmillennialism|postmillennialists]]. The mediaeval Catholic church built its system of eschatology on Augustinian amillennialism, where Christ rules the earth spiritually through his triumphant church.<ref>{{cite book|author=Blomberg, Craig L. |title=From Pentecost to Patmos|publisher=Apollos|year=2006|page=519|isbn=0805432485}}</ref> At the Reformation, theologians such as [[John Calvin]] accepted amillennialism. Augustine taught that the eternal fate of the soul is determined at death,<ref name="Oxford:unspecified">[[#Cross|Cross]]</ref><ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Enchiridion'', 110</ref> and that [[purgatory|purgatorial]] fires of the [[intermediate state]] purify only those that died in communion with the Church. His teaching provided fuel for later theology.<ref name="Oxford:unspecified"/>

===Epistemological views===
Epistemological concerns shaped Augustine's intellectual development. His early dialogues [''Contra academicos'' (386) and ''De Magistro'' (389)], both written shortly after his conversion to Christianity, reflect his engagement with skeptical arguments and show the development of his doctrine of [[Illuminationist philosophy|inner illumination]]. Augustine also posed the [[problem of other minds]] throughout different works, most famously perhaps in ''[[On the Trinity]]'' (VIII.6.9), and developed what has come to be a standard solution: the argument from analogy to other minds.<ref>{{cite book|author=Matthews, Gareth B. |title=Thought's ego in Augustine and Descartes|isbn=0801427754|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1992}}</ref> In contrast to Plato and other earlier philosophers, Augustine recognized the centrality of [[Philosophical problems of testimony|testimony]] to human knowledge and argued that what others tell us can provide knowledge even if we don't have independent reasons to believe their testimonial reports.<ref>{{cite journal|last=King|first=Peter|author2=Nathan Ballantyne|title=Augustine on gTestimony|journal=Canadian Journal of Philosophy|year=2009|volume=39|issue=2|doi=10.1353/cjp.0.0045|url=http://www.canadianjournalofphilosophy.com/PDFs/cjp39-2--195-214--Ballantyne-King.pdf|page=195}}</ref>

===Just war===
{{See also|Just War}}
Augustine asserted that Christians should be [[pacifists]] as a personal, philosophical stance.<ref>[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/septemberweb-only/9-17-55.0.html A Time For War?] Christianity Today (2001-01-09). Retrieved on 2013-04-28.</ref> Nonetheless, he asserted, peacefulness in the face of a grave wrong that could only be stopped by violence would be a sin. Defense of one's self or others could be a necessity, especially when authorized by a legitimate authority. While not breaking down the conditions necessary for war to be just, Augustine nonetheless originated the very phrase, itself, in his work ''The City of God''.<ref>[http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html Augustine of Hippo]. Crusades-encyclopedia.com.

===Mariology===
Although Augustine did not develop an independent [[Mariology]], his statements on Mary surpass in number and depth those of other early writers.<ref>O Stegm<U+00FC>ller, in Marienkunde, 455</ref> Even before the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], he defended the [[perpetual virginity of Mary|ever Virgin Mary]] as the [[theotokos|Mother of God]], who, because of her virginity, is full of grace.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''De Sancta Virginitate'', 6,6, 191.</ref> Likewise, he affirmed that the Virgin Mary "conceived as virgin, gave birth as virgin and stayed virgin forever".<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''De Sancta Virginitate'', 18</ref>

===Natural knowledge and biblical interpretation===
Augustine took the view that the Biblical text should not be interpreted as properly literal, but rather as metaphorical, if it contradicts what we know from science and our God-given reason. While each passage of Scripture has a literal sense, this "literal sense" does not always mean that the Scriptures are mere history; at times they are rather an extended metaphor.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''De Genesi ad literam 1:19<U+2013>20'', Chapt. 19 [408], ''De Genesi ad literam'', 2:9</ref>

===Original sin===
{{see also|Original sin}}

[[File:Saint Augustine by Philippe de Champaigne.jpg|thumb|Portrait by [[Philippe de Champaigne]], 17th century]]
Augustine taught that Original sin of Adam and Eve was either an act of foolishness (''insipientia'') followed by pride and disobedience to God or that pride came first.<ref>He explained to Julian of Eclanum that it was a most subtle job to discern what came first: ''Sed si disputatione subtilissima et elimatissima opus est, ut sciamus utrum primos homines insipientia superbos, an insipientes superbia fecerit''. (''Contra Julianum'', V, 4.18; PL 44, 795)</ref> The first couple disobeyed God, who had told them not to eat of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]] (Gen 2:17).<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''On the Literal Meaning of Genesis'' (''De Genesi ad litteram''), VIII, 6:12, vol. 1, p. 192-3 and 12:28, vol. 2, p. 219-20, trans. John Hammond Taylor SJ;[[Biblioth<U+00E8>que Augustinniene|BA]] 49,28 and 50<U+2013>52; [[Patrologia Latina|PL]] 34, 377; cf. idem, ''De Trinitate'', XII, 12.17; [[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 50, 371<U+2013>372 [v. 26<U+2013>31;1<U+2013>36];  ''De natura boni'' 34<U+2013>35; CSEL 25, 872; PL 42, 551<U+2013>572</ref> The tree was a symbol of the order of creation.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''On the Literal Meaning of Genesis'' (''De Genesi ad litteram''), VIII, 4.8; [[Biblioth<U+00E8>que Augustinniene|BA]] 49, 20</ref> Self-centeredness made Adam and Eve eat of it, thus failing to acknowledge and respect the world as it was created by God, with its hierarchy of beings and values.<ref>Augustine explained it in this way: "Why therefore is it enjoined upon mind, that it should know itself? I suppose, in order that, it may consider itself, and live according to its own nature; that is, seek to be regulated according to its own nature, viz., under Him to whom it ought to be subject, and above those things to which it is to be preferred; under Him by whom it ought to be ruled, above those things which it ought to rule. For it does many things through vicious desire, as though in forgetfulness of itself. For it sees some things intrinsically excellent, in that more excellent nature which is God: and whereas it ought to remain steadfast that it may enjoy them, it is turned away from Him, by wishing to appropriate those things to itself, and not to be like to Him by His gift, but to be what He is by its own, and it begins to move and slip gradually down into less and less, which it thinks to be more and more." ("[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/130105.htm On the Trinity]" (''De Trinitate''), 5:7; [[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 50, 320 [1<U+2013>12])</ref> They would not have fallen into pride and lack of wisdom, if Satan hadn't sown into their senses "the root of evil" (''radix Mali'').<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Nisi radicem mali humanus tunc reciperet sensus''  ("Contra Julianum", I, 9.42; PL 44, 670)</ref> Their nature was wounded by [[concupiscence]] or [[libido]], which affected human intelligence and will, as well as affections and desires, including sexual desire.<ref>In one of Augustine's late works, ''Retractationes'', he made a significant remark indicating the way he understood difference between spiritual, moral libido and the sexual desire: "Libido is not good and righteous use of the libido" ("libido non est bonus et rectus usus libidinis"). See the whole passage: ''Dixi etiam quodam loco: <U+00AB>Quod enim est cibus ad salutem hominis, hoc est concubitus ad salutem generis, et utrumque non est sine delectatione carnali, quae tamen modificata et temperantia refrenante in usum naturalem redacta, libido esse non potest<U+00BB>. Quod ideo dictum est, quoniam "libido non est bonus et rectus usus libidinis". Sicut enim malum est male uti bonis, ita bonum bene uti malis. De qua re alias, maxime contra novos haereticos Pelagianos, diligentius disputavi''. Cf. ''De bono coniugali'', 16.18; PL 40, 385; ''De nuptiis et concupiscentia'', II, 21.36; PL 44, 443; ''Contra Iulianum'', III, 7.16; PL 44, 710; ibid., V, 16.60; PL 44, 817.

Augustine's understanding of the consequences of the original sin and of necessity of the redeeming grace was developed in the struggle against [[Pelagius]] and his [[Pelagianism|Pelagian]] disciples, [[Caelestius]] and [[Julian of Eclanum]],<ref name="Gonzalez"/> who had been inspired by Rufinus of Syria, a disciple of [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]].<ref>[[Marius Mercator]] ''Lib. subnot.in verb.

Human nature cannot lose its moral capacity for doing good, but a person is free to act or not to act in a righteous way. Pelagius gave an example of eyes: they have capacity for seeing, but a person can make either good or bad use of it.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''[http://www.augustinus.it/latino/grazia_cristo/grazia_cristo_1_libro.htm De gratia Christi et de peccato originali]'', I, 15.16; CSEL 42, 138 [v.24<U+2013>29]; Ibid., I,4.5; CSEL 42, 128 [v.15<U+2013>23].

Immorality, ''e.g.'' fornication, is exclusively a matter of will, ''i.e.'' a person does not use natural desires in a proper way.
In opposition to that, Augustine pointed out to the apparent disobedience of the flesh to the spirit, and explained it as one of the results of original sin, punishment of Adam and Eve's disobedience to God.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Against Two Letters of the Pelagians'' 1.31<U+2013>32</ref>

Clarke SJ writes: ''Towards Neoplatonism there was throughout his life a decidedly ambivalent attitude; one must expect both agreement and sharp dissent, derivation but also repudiation. In the matter which concerns us here, the agreement with Neoplatonism (and with the Platonic tradition in general) centers on two related notions: immutability as primary characteristic of divinity, and likeness to divinity as the primary vocation of the soul.

Some authors perceive Augustine's doctrine as directed against human [[sex]]uality and attribute his insistence on continence and devotion to God as coming from Augustine's need to reject his own highly sensual nature as described in the Confessions. But in view of his writings it is apparently a misunderstanding.<ref>Gerald Bonner's comment explains a little bit why there are so many authors who write false things about Augustine's views: ''It is, of course, always easier to oppose and denounce than to understand''.

That healing is a process realized in conjugal acts. The virtue of continence is achieved thanks to the grace of the sacrament of Christian marriage, which becomes therefore a ''remedium concupiscentiae'' <U+2013> remedy of concupiscence.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''De continentia'', 12.27; PL 40, 368; Ibid., 13.28; PL 40, 369; ''Contra Julianum'', III, 15.29, PL 44, 717; Ibid., III, 21.42, PL 44, 724.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=|title=A Postscript to the Remedium Concupiscentiae|journal=The Thomist|volume= 70 |year=2006|pages= 481<U+2013>536 |url=http://www.cormacburke.or.ke/node/932}}</ref> The redemption of human sexuality will be, however, fully accomplished only in the resurrection of the body.<ref>''[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1501.htm Merits and Remission of Sin, and Infant Baptism]'' (''De peccatorum meritis et remissione et de baptismo parvulorum''), I, 6.6; PL 44, 112<U+2013>113; cf.

The sin of Adam is inherited by all human beings. Already in his pre-Pelagian writings, Augustine taught that Original Sin was transmitted by [[concupiscence]],<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Imperfectum Opus contra Iulianum'', II, 218</ref> which he regarded as the passion of both, soul and body,<ref>In 393 or 394 he commented: ''Moreover, if unbelief is fornication, and idolatry unbelief, and covetousness idolatry, it is not to be doubted that covetousness also is fornication. Who, then, in that case can rightly separate any unlawful lust whatever from the category of fornication, if covetousness is fornication? And from this we perceive, that because of unlawful lusts, not only those of which one is guilty in acts of uncleanness with another's husband or wife, but any unlawful lusts whatever, which cause the soul making a bad use of the body to wander from the law of God, and to be ruinously and basely corrupted, a man may, without crime, put away his wife, and a wife her husband, because the Lord makes the cause of fornication an exception; which fornication, in accordance with the above considerations, we are compelled to understand as being general and universal'' ("[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/16011.htm On the Sermon on the Mount]", ''De sermone Domini in monte'', 1:16:46; [[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 35, 52)</ref> making humanity a ''massa damnata'' (mass of perdition, condemned crowd) and much enfeebling, though not destroying, the freedom of the will.

Augustine's formulation of the doctrine of original sin was confirmed at numerous councils, ''i.e.'' [[Councils of Carthage|Carthage]] (418), [[First Council of Ephesus|Ephesus]] (431),
[[Councils of Orange (529)|Orange]] (529), [[Council of Trent|Trent]] (1546) and by popes, ''i.e.'' [[Pope Innocent I]] (401<U+2013>417) and [[Pope Zosimus]] (417<U+2013>418). [[Anselm of Canterbury]] established in his ''[[Cur Deus Homo]]'' the definition that was followed by the great Schoolmen, namely that Original Sin is the "privation of the righteousness which every man ought to possess", thus interpreting ''concupiscence'' as something more than mere sexual lust, with which some of Augustine's disciples had defined it<ref>{{cite book |title=The Making of the Middle Ages |last=Southern |first=R.W. |year=1953 |location=London |pages=234<U+2013>7}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=St. Augustine of Hippo.

Augustine taught that some people are [[Predestination|predestined]] by God to salvation by an eternal, sovereign decree which is [[unconditional election|not based on man's merit or will]]. The saving grace which God bestows is [[irresistible grace|irresistible]] and unfailingly results in conversion. God also grants those whom he saves with the gift of [[perseverance of the saints|perseverance]] so that none of those whom God has chosen may conceivably fall away.<ref name="Gonzalez"/>{{rp|44}}<ref>{{cite book|last=H<U+00E4>gglund|first=Bengt|title=Teologins historia|language=German|trans_title=History of Theology|others=Translated by Gene J.

The [[Catholic Church]] considers Augustine's teaching to be consistent with free will.<ref name="ceteach"/> He often said that any can be saved if they wish.<ref name="ceteach"/> While God knows who will be saved and who will not, with no possibility that one destined to be lost will be saved, this knowledge represents God's perfect knowledge of how humans will freely choose their destinies.<ref name="ceteach">Portali<U+00E9>, Eug<U+00E8>ne.

===Sacramental theology===
Also in reaction against the Donatists, Augustine developed a distinction between the "regularity" and "validity" of the [[sacraments]]. Regular sacraments are performed by clergy of the Catholic Church while sacraments performed by schismatics are considered irregular. Nevertheless, the validity of the sacraments do not depend upon the holiness of the priests who perform them (''[[ex opere operato]]''); therefore, irregular sacraments are still accepted as valid provided they are done in the name of Christ and in the manner prescribed by the Church. On this point Augustine departs from the earlier teaching of Cyprian, who taught that converts from schismatic movements must be re-baptised.<ref name="Gonzalez"/> Augustine taught that sacraments administered outside the Catholic Church, though true sacraments, avail nothing. However, he also stated that baptism, while it does not confer any grace when done outside the Church, does confer grace as soon as one is received into the Catholic Church.
[[File:Vittore carpaccio, visione di sant'agostino 01.jpg|thumb|300px|left|''[[St. Augustine in His Study (Carpaccio)|St. Augustine in His Study]]'' by [[Vittore Carpaccio]], 1502]]
Augustine upheld the early Christian understanding of the [[Real Presence]] of Christ in the Eucharist, saying that Christ's statement, "This is my body" referred to the bread he carried in his hands,<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Explanations of the Psalms'' 33:1:10 [405]</ref><ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Sermons'' 227 [411]</ref> and that Christians must have faith that the bread and wine are in fact the body and blood of Christ, despite what they see with their eyes.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Sermons'' 272</ref>

Against the [[Pelagians]], Augustine strongly stressed the importance of [[infant baptism]]. About the question whether baptism is an absolute necessity for salvation, however, Augustine appears to have refined his beliefs during his lifetime, causing some confusion among later theologians about his position. He said in one of his sermons that only the baptized are saved.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''A Sermon to Catechumens on the Creed'', Paragraph 16</ref> This belief was shared by many early Christians. However, a passage from his ''City of God'', concerning the Apocalypse, may indicate that Augustine did believe in an exception for children born to Christian parents.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', Book 20, Chapter 8</ref>

===Statements on Jews===
Against certain Christian movements, some of which rejected the use of Hebrew Scripture, Augustine countered that God had chosen the Jews as a special people,<ref>[[Diarmaid MacCulloch]]. ''[[The Reformation: A History]]'' (Penguin Group, 2005) p 8.</ref> and he considered the scattering of Jewish people by the Roman Empire to be a fulfillment of prophecy.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', book 18, chapter 46.</ref> He rejected homicidal attitudes, quoting part of the same prophecy, namely "Slay them not, lest they should at last forget Thy law" (Psalm 59:11). Augustine, who believed Jewish people would be converted to Christianity at "the end of time," argued that God had allowed them to survive their dispersion as a warning to Christians; as such, he argued, they should be permitted to dwell in Christian lands.<ref>Edwards, J. (1999) ''The Spanish Inquisition'', Stroud, pp. 33<U+2013>35, ISBN 0752417703.</ref>

===Views on sexuality===
For Augustine, the evil of sexual immorality was not in the sexual act itself, but rather in the emotions that typically accompany it. In ''On Christian Doctrine'' Augustine contrasts love, which is enjoyment on account of God, and lust, which is not on account of God.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''On Christian Doctrine'', 3.37</ref> For Augustine, proper love exercises a denial of selfish pleasure and the subjugation of corporeal desire to God. He wrote that the pious virgins raped during the sack of Rome, were innocent because they did not intend to sin.<ref>Russell, Bertrand. (1945) ''A History of Western Philosophy'', Simon & Schuster. p. 356.</ref><ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', Book I, Ch. 16, 18.</ref>

Augustine's view of sexual feelings as sinful affected his view of women.  For example he considered a man<U+2019>s erection to be sinful, though involuntary,<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', 14.17</ref> because it did not take place under his conscious control.  His solution was to place controls on women to limit their ability to influence men.<ref name="Reuther, R.R. 2007 pp. 47-68">Reuther, R.R. (2007). "Augustine: sexuality gender and women", pp. 47<U+2013>68 in J.C. Stark (Ed.), ''Feminist interpretations of Augustine'',  University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University Press, ISBN 027103257X.</ref>

He believed that the serpent approached Eve because she was less rational and lacked self-control, while Adam's choice to eat was viewed as an act of kindness so that Eve would not be left alone.<ref name="Reuther, R.R. 2007 pp. 47-68"/> Augustine believed sin entered the world because man (the spirit) did not exercise control over woman (the flesh).<ref>Edwards, B. (2011) ''Let My People Go: A Call to End the Oppression of Women in the Church'', Charleston, SC: Createspace, ISBN 1466401117.</ref> Augustine's views on women were not all negative, however. In his ''Tractates on the Gospel of John'', Augustine, commenting on the Samaritan woman from John 4:1<U+2013>42, uses the woman as a figure of the church.

According to Raming, the authority of the ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]'', a collection of Roman Catholic [[canon law]] which prohibits women from leading, teaching, or being a witness, rests largely on the views of the early church fathers<U+2014>one of the most influential being St. Augustine, the Bishop of Hippo.<ref>Raming, I.

Augustine is considered an influential figure in the history of education. A work early in Augustine's writings is ''De Magistro'' (the Teacher), which contains insights about education. However, his ideas changed as he found better directions or better ways of expressing his ideas. In the last years of his life Saint Augustine wrote his "Retractationes", reviewing his writings and improving specific texts. Henry Chadwick believes an accurate translation of "retractationes" may be "reconsiderations". Reconsiderations can be seen as an overarching theme of the way Saint Augustine learned. Augustine's understanding of the search for understanding/meaning/truth as a restless journey leaves room for doubt, development and change.<ref name=mccloskey/>

Gary N. McCloskey finds four "encounters of learning" in Augustine's approach to education: Through Transforming Experiences; as a Journey in Search of Understanding/Meaning/Truth; Learning with Others in Community; and Building the Habits (Love) of Learning. His emphasis on the importance of community as a means of learning distinguishes his pedagogy from some others. Augustine believed that dialogue/dialectic/discussion is the best means for learning, and this method should serve as a model for learning encounters between teachers and students. Saint Augustine<U+2019>s dialogue writings model the need for lively interactive dialogue among learners.<ref name=mccloskey>McCloskey, Gary N. (April 2008) [http://www.merrimack.edu/academics/augustinian_pedagogy/documents/encountering_0408.pdf Encounters of Learning: Saint Augustine on Education], Saint Augustine Institute for Learning and Teaching, Merrimack College.</ref>

He introduced the theory of three different categories of students, and instructed teachers to adapt their teaching styles to each student's individual learning style. The three different kinds of students are: the student who has been well-educated by knowledgeable teachers; the student who has had no education; and the student who has had a poor education, but believes himself to be well-educated. If a student has been well educated in a wide variety of subjects, the teacher must be careful not to repeat what they have already learned, but to challenge the student with material which they do not yet know thoroughly. With the student who has had no education, the teacher must be patient, willing to repeat things until the student understands, and sympathetic. Perhaps the most difficult student, however, is the one with an inferior education who believes he understands something when he does not. Augustine stressed the importance of showing this type of student the difference between "having words and having understanding," and of helping the student to remain humble with his acquisition of knowledge.

Augustine introduced the idea of teachers responding positively to the questions they may receive from their students, no matter if the student interrupted his teacher. Augustine also founded the ''restrained'' style of teaching. This teaching style ensures the students' full understanding of a concept because the teacher does not bombard the student with too much material; focuses on one topic at a time; helps them discover what they don't understand, rather than moving on too quickly; anticipates questions; and helps them learn to solve difficulties and find solutions to problems. Yet another of Augustine's major contributions to education is his study on the styles of teaching. He claimed there are two basic styles a teacher uses when speaking to the students. The ''mixed style'' includes complex and sometimes showy language to help students see the beautiful artistry of the subject they are studying. The ''grand style'' is not quite as elegant as the mixed style, but is exciting and heartfelt, with the purpose of igniting the same passion in the students' hearts. Augustine balanced his teaching philosophy with the traditional [[Bible]]-based practice of strict discipline.

Augustine was one of the most prolific Latin authors in terms of surviving works, and the list of his works consists of more than one hundred separate titles.<ref>Wright, F.A. and Sinclair, T.A. (1931) ''A History of Later Latin Literature'', Dawsons of Pall Mall, London, pp. 56 ff.</ref> They include [[apologetics|apologetic]] works against the heresies of the [[Arianism|Arians]], [[Donatists]], [[Manichaeans]] and [[Pelagians]]; texts on Christian [[doctrine]], notably ''[[De Doctrina Christiana]]'' (''On Christian Doctrine''); [[exegesis|exegetical]] works such as commentaries on [[Book of Genesis]], the [[Psalms]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul's]] [[Letter to the Romans]]; many [[sermons]] and [[Letter (message)|letters]]; and the ''Retractationes'', a review of his earlier works which he wrote near the end of his life. Apart from those, Augustine is probably best known for his ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'', which is a personal account of his earlier life, and for ''De civitate dei'' (''[[The City of God (book)|The City of God]]'', consisting of 22 books), which he wrote to restore the confidence of his fellow Christians, which was badly shaken by the sack of [[Rome]] by the [[Visigoths]] in 410. His ''[[On the Trinity]]'', in which he developed what has become known as the 'psychological analogy' of the [[Trinity]], is also among his masterpieces, and arguably one of the greatest theological works of all time. He also wrote ''On Free Choice Of The Will'' (''[[De libero arbitrio (Augustine)|De libero arbitrio]]''), addressing why God gives humans free will that can be used for evil.

In both his philosophical and theological reasoning, Augustine was greatly influenced by [[Stoicism]], [[Platonism]] and [[Neo-platonism]], particularly by the work of [[Plotinus]], author of the [[Enneads]], probably through the mediation of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and [[Gaius Marius Victorinus|Victorinus]] (as [[Pierre Hadot]] has argued). Although he later abandoned Neoplatonism, some ideas are still visible in his early writings.<ref>[[Bertrand Russell]] ''History of western Philosophy'' Book II Chapter IV</ref> His early and influential writing on the [[Will (philosophy)|human will]], a central topic in [[ethics]], would become a focus for later philosophers such as [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]. In addition, Augustine was influenced by the works of [[Virgil]] (known for his teaching on language), Cicero (known for his teaching on argument), and [[Aristotle]] (particularly his [[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]] and [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

[[Thomas Aquinas]] was influenced heavily by Augustine. On the topic of original sin, Aquinas proposed a more optimistic view of man than that of Augustine in that his conception leaves to the reason, will, and passions of fallen man their natural powers even after the Fall.<ref name="Oxford:Original">[[#Cross|Cross]], Ch. "Original Sin"</ref> Augustine's doctrine of [[efficacious grace]] found eloquent expression in the works of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]]; also [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] theologians such as [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]] would look back to him as their inspiration.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

[[Philosopher]] [[Bertrand Russell]] was impressed by Augustine's meditation on the nature of time in the ''Confessions'', comparing it favourably to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s version of the view that time is subjective.<ref>[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]], 1946, reprinted Unwin Paperbacks 1979, pp. 352<U+2013>353.</ref> Catholic theologians generally subscribe to Augustine's belief that God exists [[eternity|outside of time]] in the "eternal present"; that time only exists within the created universe because only in space is time discernible through motion and change. His meditations on the nature of time are closely linked to his consideration of the human ability of [[memory]]. [[Frances Yates]] in her 1966 study''[[The Art of Memory]]'' argues that a brief passage of the ''Confessions'', 10.8.12, in which Augustine writes of walking up a flight of stairs and entering the vast fields of memory<ref>[http://www.stoa.org/hippo/text10.html#TB10C8S12 Confessiones Liber X: commentary on 10.8.12] ''(in Latin)''</ref> clearly indicates that the ancient Romans were aware of how to use explicit spatial and architectural metaphors as a [[mnemonic]] technique for organizing large amounts of information.

Augustine's philosophical method, especially demonstrated in his ''Confessions'', had continuing influence on Continental philosophy throughout the 20th century. His descriptive approach to intentionality, memory, and language as these phenomena are experienced within consciousness and time anticipated and inspired the insights of modern [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[hermeneutics]].<ref>{{cite book|last=de Paulo|first=Craig J.

Tr. James S. Churchill. Bloomington: Indiana UP, p. 21.</ref> [[Martin Heidegger]] refers to Augustine's descriptive philosophy at several junctures in his influential work ''Being and Time''.<ref>For example, Heidegger's articulations of how "Being-in-the-world" is described through thinking about ''seeing'': "The remarkable priority of 'seeing' was noticed particularly by Augustine, in connection with his Interpretation of ''concupiscentia''." Heidegger then quotes the''Confessions'': "Seeing belongs properly to the eyes. But we even use this word 'seeing' for the other senses when we devote them to cognizing... We not only say, 'See how that shines', ... 'but we even say, 'See how that sounds'". ''Being and Time'', Trs. Macquarrie & Robinson. New York: Harpers, 1964, p. 171.</ref> [[Hannah Arendt]] began her philosophical writing with a dissertation on Augustine's concept of love, ''Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin'' (1929): "The young Arendt attempted to show that the philosophical basis for ''vita socialis'' in Augustine can be understood as residing in neighbourly love, grounded in his understanding of the common origin of humanity."<ref>{{cite journal|author=Chiba, Shin|title= Hannah Arendt on Love and the Political: Love, Friendship, and Citizenship|journal=The Review of Politics|volume= 57|issue= 3 |year=1995|pages= 505<U+2013>535 (507)|jstor=1408599|doi=10.1017/S0034670500019720}}</ref> Jean Bethke Elshtain in ''Augustine and the Limits of Politics'' finds likeness between Augustine and Arendt in their concepts of evil: "Augustine did not see evil as glamorously demonic but rather as absence of good, something which paradoxically is really nothing.

According to [[Leo Ruickbie]], Augustine's arguments against [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], differentiating it from miracle, were crucial in the early Church's fight against paganism and became a central thesis in the later denunciation of witches and witchcraft. According to Professor Deepak Lal, Augustine's vision of the heavenly city has influenced the secular projects and traditions of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], Marxism, Freudianism and Eco-fundamentalism.<ref name="Deepak Lal">Lal, D. (March 2002) [http://www.econ.ucla.edu/workingpapers/wp812.pdf Morality and Capitalism: Learning from the Past]. Working Paper Number 812, Department of Economics, University of California, Los Angeles.</ref>  Post-Marxist philosophers Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt rely heavily on Augustine's thought, particularly The City of God, in their book of political-philosophy "Empire."

While in his pre-Pelagian writings Augustine taught that Adam's guilt as transmitted to his descendants much enfeebles, though does not destroy, the freedom of their will, Protestant reformers Martin Luther and [[John Calvin]] affirmed that Original Sin completely destroyed liberty (see [[total depravity]]).<ref name="Oxford:Original"/>

Augustine has influenced many modern-day theologians and authors such as [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]]. [[Hannah Arendt]], an influential 20th century political theorist, wrote her doctoral dissertation in philosophy on St. Augustine, and continued to rely on his thought throughout her career. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] extensively quotes Augustine in ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' for his approach to language, both admiringly, and as a sparring partner to develop his own ideas, including an extensive opening passage from the ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]''. In his autobiographical book ''Milestones'', Pope [[Benedict XVI]], claims St. Augustine as one of the deepest influences in his thought.
