'''Abel-beth-maachah''' - meadow of the house of Maachah, a city in the north of [[Israel]], in the neighbourhood of Dan and Ijon, in the tribe of Naphtali.

It was a place of considerable strength and importance. It is called a "mother in Israel", i.e., a
metropolis (2 Sam. 20:19). It was besieged by [[Joab]] (2 [[Books of Samuel|Sam.]] 20:14), by Benhadad (1 [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 15:20), and by [[Tiglath-Pileser III|Tiglath-pileser]] (2 Kings 15:29) about [[734 BC]]. It is elsewhere called Abel-maim, meadow of the waters, (2 Chr. 16:4).

Its site is occupied by the modern Abil or Abil-el-kamh, on a rising ground to the east of the brook Derdarah, which flows through the plain of Huleh into the [[River Jordan|Jordan]], about 6 miles to the west-north-west of Dan.
