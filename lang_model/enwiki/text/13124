}}</ref> Located on the banks of the [[Sabarmati River|River Sabarmati]], the city is the administrative centre of Ahmedabad district, and was the capital of Gujarat from 1960 to 1970 after which the capital was moved to [[Gandhinagar]]. The city is sometimes called '''Karnavati''', a name for an older town that existed in the same location; in colloquial Gujarati, it is commonly called '''Amdavad'''. 

The city was founded in 1411 to serve as the capital of the [[Muzaffarid dynasty|Sultanate of Gujarat]], by its namesake, [[Sultan]] [[Ahmed Shah of Gujarat|Ahmed Shah]]. Under [[British Raj|British rule]], a military [[cantonment]] was established and the city infrastructure was modernised and expanded. Although incorporated into the [[Bombay Presidency]], Ahmedabad remained the most important city in the Gujarat region. The city established itself as the home of a booming textile industry, which earned it the nickname, "''the [[Manchester]] of the East''."<ref name=manchester>{{cite news | first = | last = | author = A.

With the [[States Reorganisation Act|creation of the state of Gujarat]] in 1960, Ahmedabad gained prominence as the political and commercial capital of the state. Once characterised by dusty roads and [[bungalow]]s, the city is witnessing a major construction boom and population increase. A rising centre of education, [[information technology]] and scientific industries, Ahmedabad remains the cultural and commercial heart of Gujarat, and much of western India.

==History==
{{main|History of Ahmedabad}}
[[Image:Sidi Saiyyad Ni Jaali.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Exterior view of the [[Sidi Saiyyed Jaali]] &mdash; an unofficial symbol of Ahmedabad]]
Archaeological evidence suggests that the area around Ahmedabad has been inhabited since the 11th century, when it was known as ''Ashapalli'' or ''[[Ashaval]]''. At that time, [[Karandev I]], the [[Solanki]] ruler of [[Anhilwara]] (modern [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]]) waged a successful war against the [[Bhil]] king of Ashaval. Soon after the victory, he established a city called ''Karnavati'' on the banks of the Sabarmati at the site of modern Ahmedabad. Solanki rule lasted until the 13th century, when Gujarat came under the control of the [[Vaghela dynasty]] of [[Dholka]] and Ahmedabad was conquered by the [[Sultanate of Delhi]].

[[Image:Cloth map of ahmedabad.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Map of Ahmedabad, depicted in a miniature style painting on a cloth, circa 19th century]]
In 1411, the rule of the [[Muzaffarid dynasty]] was established in Gujarat. According to tradition, Sultan [[Ahmed Shah]], while camping on the banks of the River Sabarmati, saw a hare chasing a dog. Impressed by this act of bravery, the Sultan, who had been looking for a place to build his new capital, decided to locate the capital here and called it Ahmedabad.<ref>

In 1487, [[Mahmud Begada]] the grandson of Ahmed Shah, fortified the city with an outer wall 10&nbsp;km (6&nbsp;miles) in circumference and consisting of [[Ahmedabad's Darwajas|twelve gates]], 189 bastions and over 6,000 battlements. Ahmedabad was ruled by the Muzaffarid dynasty till 1573 when [[Muzaffar II]] was the Sultan of Ahmedabad. Gujarat was then conquered by the [[Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar]] in 1573. During the Mughal reign, Ahmedabad became one of the Empire's thriving centres of trade, mainly in textiles, which were exported to as far as Europe. The Mughal ruler [[Shahjahan]] spent the prime of his life in the city, sponsoring the construction of the [[Moti Shahi Mahal]] in [[Shahibaug]]. The armies of the [[Maratha]] generals Raghunath Rao and Damaji [[Gaekwad]] captured the city and ended Mughal rule in Ahmedabad. A famine in 1630 and the constant conflicts between the [[Peshwa]] and the Gaekwad armies virtually destroyed many parts of the city, causing its population to flee.<ref>{{

In 1864, a railway link between Ahmedabad and [[Mumbai]] (then Bombay) was established by the [[Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway]] (BB&CI), making Ahmedabad an important junction in the traffic and trade between [[North India|northern]] and [[South India|southern India]]. Large numbers of people migrated from rural areas to work in textile mills, establishing a robust industry.

The [[Indian independence movement]] developed strong roots in the city when, in 1915, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] established two [[ashram]]s &mdash; the [[Kochrab Ashram]] near [[Paldi]] in 1915 and the [[Sabarmati Ashram|Satyagraha Ashram]] on the banks of the Sabarmati in 1917 &mdash; that would become centres of intense nationalist activities. During the [[Non-Cooperation Movement|mass protests]] against the [[Rowlatt Act]] in 1919, textile workers burned down 51 government buildings across the city in protest at a British attempt to extend wartime regulations after the [[First World War]].<ref>{{

In 1930, Gandhi initiated the [[Salt Satyagraha]] from Ahmedabad by embarking from his ashram on the famous [[Dandi Salt March]]. The city administration and economic institutions were rendered functionless by the large masses of people who took to the streets in peaceful protests in the early 1930s, and again in 1942 during the [[Quit India Movement|Quit India movement]]. Following independence and the [[partition of India]] in 1947, the city was scarred by intense communal violence that broke out between [[Hindus]] and [[Muslims]].

Ahmedabad became the capital of the new state of Gujarat after the bifurcation of the [[Bombay State|State of Bombay]] on [[1 May]], [[1960]]. During that period, a large number of educational and research institutions were founded in the city, making it a major centre of higher education, science and technology. Ahmedabad's economic base was diversified with the establishment of heavy and chemical industries in its vicinity around the same period. But the growth in the next two decades was punctuated due to political events in and around the city. In February 1974, Ahmedabad occupied the centre stage in national politics with the launch of the ''[[Nav Nirman]]'' agitation &mdash; a protest against a 20% hike in the hostel food fees at the [[L.D. College of Engineering]] that snowballed into a mass agitation to remove [[Chimanbhai Patel]], then-chief minister of Gujarat, on charges of corruption.<ref>{{

==Geography and climate==
{{main|Geography of Ahmedabad}}
[[Image:River-Sabarmati-1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|River Sabarmati]]
Ahmedabad is located at {{coor d|23.03|N|72.58|E|}} in western India at an elevation of 53&nbsp;metres (174&nbsp;feet). The city sits on the banks of the River Sabarmati, in north-central Gujarat. It spans an area of 205&nbsp;[[square kilometre|km<U+00B2>]] (79.15 [[square miles]]). The Sabarmati frequently dries up in the summer, leaving only a small stream of water. The city is located in a sandy and dry area. Many of the localities and roads are often spread in sand, reflecting the intensifying fallout caused by deforestation. The steady expansion of the [[Rann of Kutch]] threatens to increase [[desertification]] around the city area and much of the state. Except for the small hills of [[Thaltej-Jodhpur Tekra]], the city is almost flat. Two lakes are within the city's limits &mdash; [[Kankaria|Kankaria Lake]] and [[Vastrapur Lake]]. Kankaria lake, in the neighbourhood of [[Maninagar]], is an artificial lake developed by the Sultan of Delhi, [[Qutb-ud-din Aybak]] in 1451.<ref name=kankaria>{{

There are three main seasons: summer, monsoon and winter. Aside from the monsoon season, the climate is dry. The weather is hot through the months of March to June &mdash; the average summer maximum is 43&nbsp;[[Celsius|<U+00B0>C]] (110&nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|<U+00B0>F]]), and the average minimum is 23&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (73&nbsp;<U+00B0>F).

Cold northerly winds are responsible for a mild chill in January. The southwest [[monsoon]] brings a humid climate from mid-June to mid-September. The average rainfall is 93.2&nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]] (36.7 inches), but infrequent heavy torrential rains cause the river to flood.<ref name=climate>{{

Ahmedabad is divided by the Sabarmati into two physically distinct eastern and western regions. The eastern bank of the river houses the old city, which includes the central town of [[Bhadra]]. This part of Ahmedabad is characterised by packed bazaars, the clustered and barricaded ''[[Pol (housing)|pol]]'' system of shanty buildings, and numerous places of worship. It houses the main railway station, the [[General Post Office, Ahmedabad|General Post Office]] and landmark buildings of the Muzaffarid and British eras. The colonial period saw the expansion of the city to the western side of Sabarmati facilitated by the construction of [[Ellis Bridge]] in 1875 and later with the modern [[Nehru Bridge]]. This part of the city houses educational institutions, modern buildings, well-planned residential areas, shopping malls, [[Megaplex|multiplexes]] and new business districts centred around [[C. G. Road]], [[Ashram Road]], and more recently, the [[Sarkhej-Gandhinagar Highway]].<ref>

Ahmedabad is the largest inland industrial centre in western India, and has historically enjoyed a reputation as an important base of commerce, trade and industry. Under Muzaffarid rule, the city was a major trade destination for western India, because of its proximity to the port at [[Surat]] and for its access to the hinterland of Gujarat. In the 19th century, the textile and garments industry developed and thrived in the city &mdash; on [[May 30]], [[1861]] [[Ranchhodlal Chhotalal]] founded the first Indian textile mill, the [[Ahmedabad Spinning and Weaving Company Limited]]. This was followed by the establishment of a series of textile mills such as the [[Calico Mills]] in 1880 by Maganbhai, and mills founded by industrialists such as [[Ambalal Sarabhai]] and [[Kasturbhai Lalbhai]].<ref name=jeremy> The textile industry expanded rapidly during the [[First World War]], and benefited from the influence of Mahatma Gandhi's [[Swadeshi movement]], which promoted the purchase of Indian-made goods.<ref>

A diverse labour force of migrant workers from different parts of Gujarat and neighbouring states is integral to the economy of the city. These workers provide vital household labour and services for the city's large middle class. Ahmedabad plays a strong and significant role in providing commercial resources and market access for the economies of neighbouring cities. A majority of the working-age citizens of Ahmedabad are traders and business people. This has led to the creation of major mercantile corporations and [[Artisan#Artisan_guilds|artisan guilds]] that are a key influence on the economic life of Gujarat.
