'''Henry II''' (5 March 1133&nbsp;<U+2013> 6 July 1189), also known as '''Henry Curtmantle''', '''Henry FitzEmpress''' or '''Henry Plantagenet''', ruled as [[King of England]] (1154<U+2013>89), [[Count of Anjou]], [[Count of Maine]], [[Duke of Normandy]], [[Duke of Aquitaine]], [[Count of Nantes]], and [[Lord of Ireland]] and, at various times, controlled [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]]. Henry was born to [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]] and [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]], who claimed the title of Empress from her first marriage. He became actively involved in his mother's [[the Anarchy|efforts to claim the throne of England]] by the age of 14, and was made the Duke of Normandy at 17. He inherited [[Anjou]] in 1151 and shortly afterwards married [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], whose marriage to the French king [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]] had recently been [[Annulment|annulled]]. Henry's military expedition to England in 1153 led to King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] agreeing to a [[Treaty of Winchester|peace treaty]] in 1153 and Henry inheriting the kingdom on Stephen's death a year later. Still quite young, he now controlled what would later be called the [[Angevin empire]] stretching across much of western Europe.

Henry was an energetic and sometimes ruthless ruler, driven by a desire to restore the lands and privileges of his royal grandfather, [[Henry I of England]]. During the early years of the younger Henry's reign he restored the royal administration in England, re-established hegemony over Wales and gained full control over his lands in Anjou, [[Maine (province)|Maine]] and [[Touraine]]. Henry soon came into conflict with Louis VII and the two rulers fought what has been termed a "[[Cold war (general term)|Cold War]]" over several decades. Henry expanded his empire, often at Louis's expense, taking Brittany, pushing east into central France and south into [[Toulouse]]; despite numerous peace conferences and treaties no permanent peace was reached. Meanwhile, Henry undertook various legal reforms in both England and Normandy, establishing the basis for the future [[English law|English Common Law]], and reformed the royal finances and currency. Although Henry usually worked well with the local hierarchies of the Church, his desire to control and reform the relationship between the [[Religion in England#Christianity|church in England]] led to conflict with his former friend [[Thomas Becket]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. This [[Becket controversy|controversy]] lasted for much of the 1160s and resulted in Becket's death in 1170, for which Henry was widely blamed.

As Henry's reign progressed he had many children with Eleanor and tensions over the future inheritance of the empire began to emerge, encouraged by first Louis VII and then Louis's son and successor [[Philip Augustus]]. In 1173 Henry's then eldest son, [[Henry the Young King|Henry]], usually known as "Young Henry", rebelled in protest at his treatment by Henry; he was joined by his brothers [[Richard I of England|Richard]], [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]] and by their mother, Eleanor. France, Scotland, [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[County of Boulogne|Boulogne]] allied with the rebels against Henry. The [[Revolt of 1173<U+2013>1174|Great Revolt]] spread across Henry's lands and was only defeated by Henry's vigorous military action and talented local commanders, many of them "[[new men]]" appointed for their loyalty and administrative skills. Henry was mostly generous in victory and appeared at the height of his powers. Young Henry and Geoffrey revolted again in 1183, however, resulting in Young Henry's death. Despite [[Norman invasion of Ireland|invading Ireland]] to provide lands for his youngest son [[John of England|John]], Henry struggled to find ways to satisfy all his sons' desires for land and immediate power. Philip successfully played on Richard's fears that Henry would make John king and a final rebellion broke out in 1189. Decisively defeated by Philip and Richard and suffering from a [[Upper gastrointestinal bleeding|bleeding]] [[Peptic ulcer|ulcer]], Henry retreated to [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Chinon|Chinon]] in Anjou where he died.

Henry's empire did not long outlast him and collapsed during the reign of his youngest son John. Many of the changes Henry introduced during his long rule, however, had major long-term consequences. Henry's legal changes are generally considered to have laid down the basis for the [[English Common Law]], while his intervention in Brittany, Wales and Scotland had a significant long-term impact on the development of their societies and governmental systems. Historical interpretations of Henry's reign have changed considerably over time. In the 18th century, scholars argued that Henry was a driving force in the creation of a genuinely English monarchy and, ultimately, a unified Britain. [[Victorian era|Victorian]] historians expressed more concern over the king's private life and treatment of Becket, but - influenced by the emergence of the [[British empire]] - were keenly interested in the formation of Henry's own empire. Late twentieth century historians have focused on combining British and French historical accounts of Henry, challenging earlier Anglocentric interpretations of his reign.

{{Main|The Anarchy}}

Henry was born at [[Le Mans]] on 5 March 1133 as the eldest child of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey the Fair]], the [[Count of Anjou]], and the [[Empress Matilda]], so titled because of her first marriage to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].<ref>King (2010), p.37.</ref> Anjou had been formed in 10th century and the Angevin rulers had attempted to extend their influence and power across France through careful marriages and political alliances for several centuries.<ref>Bachrach (1978), p.298; Hallam and Everard, p.66.</ref> In theory the county answered to the French king but royal power over Anjou had weakened during the 11th century and for most practical purposes the county had become largely independent.<ref>Hallam and Everard, pp.66<U+2013>67.</ref> Henry's mother, the Empress Matilda, was the eldest daughter of [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], the [[King of England]] and the [[Duke of Normandy]]. She was born into a powerful ruling class of [[Anglo-Norman]]s, who traditionally owned extensive estates in both England and Normandy.<ref>Power (2007), p.93.</ref> Matilda was married at a young age to the [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor]]; after his death she was remarried to Geoffrey.<ref>Warren (2000), p.12.</ref> After Henry I's death in 1135, Matilda had hoped to claim the English throne but instead her cousin [[Stephen of England|Stephen of Blois]] was crowned king and recognised as the Duke of Normandy, resulting in civil war between their rival supporters.<ref>Chibnall, pp.75<U+2013>83.</ref> Geoffrey took advantage of the confusion to attack the Duchy of Normandy but he took no direct role in the English conflict, leaving this to Matilda and her half-brother, [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert of Gloucester]].<ref>Bradbury, pp.49<U+2013>52.</ref> The war, termed [[the Anarchy]] by Victorian historians, dragged on and degenerated into stalemate.<ref>Davis, p.89.</ref>

Henry probably spent some of his earliest years in his mother's household, and accompanied Matilda into Normandy in the late 1130s.<ref>Chibnall, p.144.</ref> Henry's later childhood, probably from the age of seven, was spent in Anjou, where he was educated by Peter of Saintes, a noted [[Philology|grammarian]] of the day.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.38<U+2013>39; Chibnall, p.144.</ref> Then, in late 1142, Geoffrey decided to send the nine year old Henry to [[Bristol]], the centre of Angevin opposition to Stephen in the south-west of England, accompanied by his uncle, Robert of Gloucester.<ref name=King2010P185>King (2010), p.185.</ref> Although this form of arrangement was common amongst noblemen of the period, sending Henry to England also had political benefits, as Geoffrey was coming under criticism for refusing to join the war in England himself.<ref name=King2010P185/> For about a year, Henry lived alongside [[Roger of Worcester]], one of Robert's sons, and was instructed by a ''[[Teacher|magister]]'', Master Matthew; Robert's household was known for its education and learning.<ref>King (2010), p.185; Warren (2000), p.38.</ref> The [[Canon (priest)|canon]]s of [[Bristol Cathedral|St Augustine's in Bristol]] also helped in Henry's education, and he remembered them with affection in later years.<ref>King (2010), pp.185, 274.</ref> Henry returned to Anjou either in 1143 or 1144, resuming his education under [[William of Conches]], another famous academic.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.30, 39.</ref>

Henry returned to England in 1147, then aged fourteen.<ref name=Warren2000P33>Warren (2000), p.33.</ref> Taking his immediate household and a small number of [[mercenary|mercenaries]], he left Normandy and landed in England, striking into [[Wiltshire]].<ref name=Warren2000P33/> Despite initially causing considerable panic, the expedition had little success and Henry found himself unable to pay his forces and therefore unable to return to Normandy.<ref name=Warren2000P33/> Neither his mother nor his uncle were prepared to support him, implying that they had not approved of the expedition in the first place.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.32<U+2013>34.</ref> Surprisingly, Henry instead turned to King Stephen, who paid the outstanding wages and thereby allowed Henry to retire gracefully. Stephen's reasons for doing so are unclear. One potential explanation is his general courtesy to a member of his extended family; another is that he was starting to consider how to end the war peacefully, and saw this as a way of building a relationship with Henry.<ref>King (2010), p.243; Barlow (1999), p.180.</ref> Henry intervened once again in 1149, commencing what is often termed the Henrician phase of the civil war.<ref>Hosler, p.38.</ref> This time, Henry planned to form a northern alliance with [[Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester|Ranulf of Chester]], a powerful regional leader who controlled most of the north-west of England and King [[David I of Scotland]], Henry's great-uncle.<ref>King (2010), p.253.</ref> Under this alliance, Henry and Ranulf agreed to attack [[York]], probably with help from the Scots.<ref>King (2010), p.255.</ref> The planned attack disintegrated after Stephen marched rapidly north to York, and Henry returned to Normandy.<ref name=DavidKingP255>Davis, p.107; King (2010), p.255.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Edmund King believes Henry's attack never got close to York; R. Davis believes that it did and was deterred by the presence of Stephen's forces.<ref name=DavidKingP255/>|group="nb"}}

==Appearance and personality==
Henry was said by chroniclers to be good-looking, red-haired, freckled, with a large head; he had a short, stocky body and was [[bow-legged]] from riding.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.78<U+2013>79; Vincent (2007a), pp.1<U+2013>2; Carpenter, p.192.</ref> Often he was scruffily dressed.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.78<U+2013>79.</ref> While not as reserved as his mother Matilda, nor as charming as his father Geoffrey, Henry was famous for his energy and drive.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.78, 630.</ref> Henry was also infamous for his piercing stare, his bullying force of personality and his bursts of temper; on occasion he would also fall entirely silent and angrily refuse to talk to others.<ref>Warren (2000), p.79; Vincent (2007a), p.2; Vincent (2007b), p.312.</ref> Some of these outbursts, however, may have been theatrical and for effect.<ref name=Vincent2007bPP311>Vincent (2007b), pp.311<U+2013>312.</ref>{{#tag:ref|The details of the chroniclers' descriptions are clearly influenced by [[bible|biblical accounts]], the historian Nicholas Vincent, for example, points out the close links between the account of Henry furiously eating straw, and the similar passage in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 11:7.<ref name=Vincent2007bPP311/>|group="nb"}} Henry was said to understand a wide range of languages, but spoke only [[Latin]] and [[French language|French]].<ref name=Vincent2007bP326>Vincent (2007b), p.326.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Historians are uncertain which dialect or dialects of medieval French were referred to in this context; the original chronicler simply refers to Henry speaking "''gallica''", "French".<ref name=Vincent2007bP326/>|group="nb"}} In his youth Henry enjoyed warfare, [[hunting]] and action; as the years went by he put increasing energy into [[Justice|judicial]] and administrative affairs and became more cautious, but throughout his life he was energetic and frequently impulsive.<ref>White (2000), pp.3<U+2013>4, 214.</ref>

Henry had a passionate desire to rebuild his control of the territories that his grandfather, Henry I, had once controlled.<ref>Gillingham (1984), p.21.</ref> He may well have been influenced by his mother in this regard, as Matilda also had a strong sense of ancestral rights and privileges.<ref>Martinson, p.6.</ref> This task involved re-taking territories, regaining estates and re-establishing influence over the smaller lords bordering his territories that had once provided what historian [[John Gillingham]] describes as a "protective ring" around his core territories.<ref>Gillingham (1984), pp.20<U+2013>21.</ref> Henry also introduced new traditions. He was probably the first king of England to use an [[heraldry|heraldic design]]: he had a [[signet ring]] with either a [[leopard]] or a [[lion]] engraved on it, and late in his reign one of his court is said to have worn this device on his tunic; this would be altered in later generations to form the [[Royal Arms of England|royal seal of England]].<ref>Vincent (2007b), p.324.</ref>

===Succession to Normandy and Anjou===

By the late 1140s the character of the conflict in England shifted and the active phase of the civil war was over, barring the occasional outbreak of fighting.<ref name=BarlowP180>Barlow (1999), p.180.</ref> Many of the barons were making individual peace agreements with each other to secure their war gains and it increasingly appeared as though the English Church was considering an eventual peace treaty.<ref>Stringer, p.68; Davis pp.111<U+2013>112.</ref> On Louis VII's return from the [[Second Crusade]] in 1149, he became concerned about the growth of Geoffrey's power and the potential threat to his own possessions, especially if Henry could acquire the English crown.<ref>Hallam and Everard, pp.158<U+2013>159; Warren (2000), p.42.</ref> In 1150, Geoffrey made Henry the Duke of Normandy and Louis responded by putting forward King Stephen's son [[Eustace IV, Count of Boulogne|Eustace]] as the rightful heir to the duchy, launching a military campaign to remove Henry from the province.<ref>Hallam and Everard, p.159; Warren (2000), p.42.</ref>{{#tag:ref|There was an historical debate in the early 20th century, now resolved, as to the precise date that Henry was made duke of Normandy.<ref>Brooke and Brooke, pp.81<U+2013>82; Poole, p.569.</ref>|group="nb"}} Henry's father advised him to come to terms with Louis and peace was made between them in August 1151 after mediation by [[Bernard of Clairvaux]].<ref name=Warren2000P42>Warren (2000), p.42.</ref> Under the settlement Henry did [[homage]] to Louis for Normandy and gave him the disputed lands of the Norman [[Vexin]]; in return, Louis recognised him as duke.<ref name=Warren2000P42/>

Geoffrey died in September 1151, impacting on Henry's plans to return to England, as he first needed to ensure that his succession, particularly in Anjou, was secure.<ref name=Warren2000P42/> At around this time, however, Henry was also probably secretly planning his marriage to [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], then still the wife of Louis.<ref name=Warren2000P42/> Eleanor was the Duchess of Aquitaine, a duchy in the south of France and was considered beautiful, lively and controversial, but had not borne Louis any sons.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.43<U+2013>44.</ref> Louis had the marriage [[Annulment|annulled]] and Henry married Eleanor eight weeks later on 18 May.<ref name=Warren2000P42/>{{#tag:ref|In the late 12th century, the annulment of a marriage for reasons of consanguinity was in effect a divorce process: large numbers of the marriages amongst the nobility broke the strict rules of consanguinity, and there was no alternative divorce process.

In response to the military pressure from Stephen, Henry returned to England again at the start of 1153, braving the winter storms.<ref>Warren (2000), p.49; Gillingham (1984), p.18.</ref> Despite only bringing a small army of mercenaries, probably paid for with borrowed money, Henry was supported in the north and east of England by the forces of Ranulf of Chester and [[Hugh Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk|Hugh Bigod]], and had hopes of a military victory.<ref>Bradbury, pp.178<U+2013>179; King (2007), p.24; Warren (2000), p.49.</ref> A delegation of senior English clergy met with Henry and his advisers at [[Stockbridge, Hampshire|Stockbridge]] shortly before [[Easter]].<ref>King (2007), pp.25<U+2013>26.</ref> Many of the details of their discussions are unclear, but it appears that the churchmen emphasised that while they supported Stephen as king, they sought a negotiated peace; Henry reaffirmed that he would avoid the English [[cathedral]]s and would not expect the bishops to attend his court.<ref>King (2007), p.26.</ref>

In an attempt to draw Stephen's forces away from Wallingford, Henry besieged Stephen's castle at [[Malmesbury Castle|Malmesbury]] and the king responded by marching west with an army to relieve it.<ref>Bradbury, p.180; Warren (2000), p.50.</ref> Henry successfully evaded Stephen's larger army along the [[River Avon (Bristol)|River Avon]], preventing Stephen from forcing a decisive battle.<ref>Bradbury, p.180.</ref> In the face of the increasingly wintry weather, the two men agreed to a temporary truce, leaving Henry to travel north through [[Midlands (England)|the Midlands]] where the powerful [[Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester|Robert de Beaumont]], Earl of Leicester, announced his support for his cause.<ref>Bradbury, p.180.</ref> Henry could then turn south again, turning his forces against the besiegers at Wallingford.<ref>Warren (2000), p.50.</ref> Despite only modest military successes, Henry and his allies now controlled the south-west, the Midlands and much of the north of England.<ref>Bradbury, p.181.</ref> Henry, meanwhile, was attempting to act the part of a legitimate king, witnessing marriages and settlements and holding court in a regal fashion.<ref>King (2007), p.28.</ref>

[[File:Angevin empire.svg|thumb|Henry's lands in France (in buff, orange and yellow) at their peak]]
Henry had a problematic relationship with Louis VII of France throughout the 1150s. The two men had already clashed over Henry's succession to Normandy and the remarriage of Eleanor and the relationship was not repaired. Louis invariably attempted to take the moral high ground in respect to Henry, capitalising on his reputation as a [[Crusades|crusader]] and circulating rumours about his rival's behaviour and character.<ref>Dunbabin, p.51; Power (2007), pp.124<U+2013>125.</ref> Henry had greater resources than Louis, however, particularly after taking England, and Louis was far less dynamic in resisting Angevin power than he had been earlier in his reign.<ref>Hallam and Everard, pp.160<U+2013>161.</ref> The disputes between the two drew in other powers across the region, including [[Thierry, Count of Flanders|Thierry]], the [[Count of Flanders]], who signed a military alliance with Henry, albeit with a clause that prevented the count from being forced to fight against Louis, his feudal lord.<ref>Dunbabin, p.52.</ref> Further south, [[Theobald V, Count of Blois|Theobald V]], the Count of Blois, an enemy of Louis, became another early ally of Henry.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.88<U+2013>90.</ref> The resulting military tensions and the frequent face-to-face meetings to attempt to resolve them has led historian Jean Dunbabin to liken the situation to the period of the [[Cold War]] in Europe in the 20th century.<ref>Dunbabin, pp.47, 49.</ref>

On his return to the continent from England, Henry sought to secure his French lands and quash any potential rebellion.<ref>White (2000), p.9.</ref> As a result, in 1154 Henry and Louis agreed a peace treaty, under which Henry bought back the [[Vernon, Eure|Vernon]] and the [[Neuf-March<U+00E9>]] from Louis.<ref>Gillingham (1984), p.21.</ref> The treaty appeared shaky, however and tensions remained<U+2014>in particular, Henry had not given homage to Louis for his French possessions.<ref>Gillingham (2007a), p.64; Dunbabin, p.53.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Many earlier historians believed that Henry might have given homage to Louis in 1156. Little hard evidence beyond a single chronicler account exists to support this, however, and current scholarship discounts the alleged episode.<ref>Gillingham (2007a), p.64.</ref>|group="nb"}} In an attempt to improve relations, Henry met with Louis at Paris and [[Mont-Saint-Michel]] in 1158, agreeing to betroth Henry's eldest living son, the [[Henry the Young King|Young Henry]], to Louis's daughter [[Margaret of France, Queen of England and Hungary|Margaret]].<ref name=DunbabinP53>Dunbabin, p.53.</ref> The marriage deal would have involved Louis granting the disputed territory of the [[Vexin]] to Margaret on her marriage to the Young Henry: while this would ultimately give Henry the lands that he claimed, it also cunningly implied that the Vexin was Louis's to give away in the first place, in itself a political concession.<ref>Gillingham (2007a), p.79.</ref> For a short while, a permanent peace between Henry and Louis looked plausible.<ref name=DunbabinP53/> 

Meanwhile, Henry turned his attention to the [[Duchy of Brittany]] which neighboured his lands and had traditionally been largely independent from the rest of France, with its own [[Breton language|language]] and culture.<ref>Hallam and Everard, p.65.</ref> The Breton dukes held little power across most of the duchy, which was mostly controlled by local lords.<ref>Hallam and Everard, pp.65<U+2013>66; Everard (2000), p.17.</ref> In 1148 Duke [[Conan III, Duke of Brittany|Conan III]] had died and civil war broke out.<ref>Hallam and Everard, pp.65<U+2013>66.</ref> Henry claimed to be the overlord of Brittany, on the basis that the duchy had owed loyalty to Henry I, and saw controlling the duchy both as a way of securing his other French territories and as a potential inheritance for one of his sons.<ref>Everard (2000), p.35.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Historian Judith Everard's research into Brittany has shifted academic discussion of this period, stressing the indirect way that Henry expanded his power; earlier works had tended to describe Henry as conquering Brittany through a sequence of invasions; see, for example, John Gillingham's description of the period.<ref>Everard (2000), p.35; Gillingham (1984), p.23.</ref>|group="nb"}} Initially Henry's strategy was to rule indirectly through proxies and accordingly Henry supported [[Conan IV, Duke of Brittany|Conan IV]]'s claims over most of the duchy, partially because Conan had strong English ties and could be easily influenced.<ref>Everard (2000), pp.32, 34.</ref> Conan's uncle, [[Hoel, Count of Nantes|Ho<U+00EB>l]], continued to control the [[county of Nantes]] in the east until he was deposed in 1156 by Henry's brother, Geoffrey, possibly with Henry's support.<ref>Everard (2000), p.38.</ref> When Geoffrey died in 1158, Conan attempted to reclaim Nantes but was opposed by Henry who annexed it for himself.<ref>Everard (2000), p.39.</ref> Louis took no action to intervene as Henry steadily increased his power in Brittany.<ref name=HallamEverardP161>Hallam and Everard, p.161.</ref>

Henry hoped to take a similar approach to regaining control of [[Toulouse]] in southern France.<ref name=HallamEverardP161/> Toulouse, while technically part of the Duchy of Aquitaine, had become increasingly independent and was now ruled by Count [[Raymond V, Count of Toulouse|Raymond V]] who only had a weak claim to the lands.<ref>Warren (2000), p.85.</ref> Encouraged by Eleanor, Henry first allied himself with Raymond's enemy [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona|Raymond Berenguer]] of [[Barcelona]] and then in 1159 threatened to invade himself to depose Raymond.<ref>Warren (2000), p.85.</ref> Louis, however, had married his sister [[Constance of France, Countess of Toulouse|Constance]] to Raymond in an attempt to secure his southern frontiers; nonetheless, when Henry and Louis discussed the matter of Toulouse, Henry left believing that he had the French king's support for military intervention.<ref>Dunbabin, p.50; Waren (2000), pp.85<U+2013>86.</ref> Henry invaded Toulouse, only to find Louis visiting Raymond in the city of Toulouse.<ref name=Warren2000P87>Warren (2000), p.87.</ref> Henry was not prepared to directly attack Louis, who was still his feudal lord, and withdrew, settling himself with ravaging the surrounding county, seizing castles and taking the province of [[Quercy]].<ref name=Warren2000P87/> The episode proved to be a long-running point of dispute between the two kings and the chronicler [[William of Newburgh]] called the ensuing conflict with Toulouse a "forty years' war".<ref>Dunbabin, p.56; Gillingham (1984), p.27.</ref> 

In the aftermath of the Toulouse episode, Louis made an attempt to repair relations with Henry through a 1160 peace treaty: this promised Henry the lands and the rights of his grandfather, Henry I; reaffirmed the betrothal of Young Henry and Margaret and the Vexin deal; and it involved Young Henry giving homage to Louis, a way of reinforcing the young boy's position as heir and Louis's position as king.<ref>White (2000), p.9; Gillingham (2007a), p.77; Dunbabin, pp.55<U+2013>56; Warren (2000), p.88.</ref> Almost immediately after the peace conference, however, Louis shifted his position considerably. Louis's wife Constance died and Louis married [[Ad<U+00E8>le of Champagne|Ad<U+00E8>le]], the sister of the Counts of Blois and Champagne.<ref>Warren (2000), p.88.</ref> Louis also betrothed his two daughters [[Marie of France, Countess of Champagne|Marie]] and [[Alix of France|Alix]] to Theobald of Blois's sons, [[Theobald V, Count of Blois|Theobald]] and [[Henry I, Count of Champagne|Henry]].<ref name=Warren2000P90>Warren (2000), p.90.</ref> This represented an aggressive containment strategy towards Henry rather than the agreed rapprochement, and caused Theobald to abandon his alliance with Henry.<ref name=Warren2000P90/> Henry reacted angrily; the king had custody of both Young Henry and Margaret, and in November he bullied several [[papal legate]]s into marrying them<U+2014>despite the children only being five and three years old respectively<U+2014>and promptly seized the Vexin.<ref>Dunbabin, pp.55<U+2013>56.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Henry's influence over the papal legates resulted from the schism that had occurred in the Church between Victor IV and Alexander III.<ref>Barlow (1936), p.264.</ref> The Holy Roman Emperor Frederick, who preferred Victor, called a council from across Europe to consider the case; to support this process, local discussions were held in France, England and Normandy, while a probable joint council sponsored by Henry and Louis occurred at [[Beauvais]] in July 1160.<ref>Barlow (1936), pp.264, 266.</ref> The precise events and decisions at these gatherings were disputed by contemporary chroniclers, but it appears that after the July discussions the decision was taken to announce a joint preference for Alexander to become the pope, to be announced in due course by Henry.<ref name=BarlowP1936>Barlow (1936), p.268.</ref> Henry used his power as the joint spokesman for England and France to convince the legates that it would be wise to marry his son.<ref name=BarlowP1936/>|group="nb"}} Now it was Louis's turn to be furious, as the move clearly broke the spirit of the 1160 treaty.<ref>Gillingham (1984), p.28.</ref>

Military tensions between the two leaders immediately increased.

===Empire and nature of government===
[[File:BecketHenryII.jpg|thumb|Early 14th century representation of Henry and [[Thomas Becket]]]]
Henry owned a greater proportion of France than any ruler since the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], which he combined with his possessions in England, Wales, Scotland and much of Ireland, producing a vast domain often referred by historians to as the [[Angevin empire]].<ref>Vincent (2007b), pp.304<U+2013>205; Hallam and Everard, pp.221<U+2013>22.</ref> This empire lacked a coherent structure or central control; instead, it consisted of a loose, flexible, network of family connections and lands.<ref>Martindale (1999), p.140; Bachrach (1978), pp.298<U+2013>299.</ref> Different local customs applied within each of Henry's different territories, although common principles underpinned some of these local variations.<ref>Gillingham (1984), pp.58<U+2013>59.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Opinions as to the nature of Henry's empire have shifted over time and the term "empire" has itself been criticised. Earlier historians, such as Jacques Boussard, argued in favour of an "administrative coherence" featuring across the empire; this view is opposed by most current historians.<ref>Hallam and Everard, pp.221<U+2013>224; Boussard, pp.572<U+2013>532, cited Hallam and Everard, p.221; White; Gillingham.</ref>|group="nb"}} Henry travelled constantly across the empire, producing what the historian John Jolliffe describes as a "government of the roads and roadsides".<ref>Jolliffe, p.140, cited by Gillingham (1984), p.53.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Henry did, however, have his favourite locations in his empire; Le Mans, for example, was his favourite town.<ref>Carpenter, p.194.</ref>|group="nb"}} His travels coincided with regional governmental reforms and other local administrative business, although messengers connected him to his possession wherever he went.<ref>White (2000), pp.8<U+2013>9.</ref> In his absence the lands were ruled by [[seneschal]]s and [[justiciar]]s, and beneath them local officials in each of the regions carried on with the business of government.<ref>Gillingham (1984), p.47.</ref> Nonetheless, many of the functions of government centred on Henry himself and he was often surrounded by petitioners requesting decisions or favours.<ref>Vincent (2007b), p.310.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Over the course of his reign, Henry, like other leaders of the period, attempted to create more private space within his household, away from the throngs of supplicants.<ref>Vincent (2007b), p.313.</ref>|group="nb"}}

From time to time, Henry's [[Court (royal)|royal court]] became a ''magnum concilium'', a great council; these were sometimes used to take major decisions but the term was loosely applied whenever a large number of barons and bishops attended the king.<ref>Warren (2000), p.303.</ref> A great council was supposed to give the king advice and give assent to royal decisions, although it is unclear how much freedom they actually enjoyed to oppose Henry's intentions.<ref>Warren (2000), p.304.</ref> Henry also appears to have consulted with his court when making [[legislation]]; the extent to which Henry then took their views into account is unclear.<ref>Brand, pp.229<U+2013>230.</ref> As a powerful ruler, Henry was able to provide either valuable patronage or impose devastating harm on his subjects.<ref>Davies, pp.71<U+2013>72.</ref> Using his powers of patronage, Henry was very effective at finding and keeping competent officials, including within the Church, in the 12th century a key part of royal administration.<ref>Jones, p.35.</ref> Indeed royal patronage within the Church provided an effective route to advancement under Henry and most of his preferred clerics eventually became bishops and archbishops.<ref>Vincent (2007b), pp.294, 319.</ref>{{#tag:ref|By contrast the number of [[earldom]]s in England, for example, shrank considerably, removing the potential for advancement for many traditional barons.<ref>Carpener, p.197.</ref>|group="nb"}} Henry could also show his ''ira et malevolentia''<U+2014>"anger and ill-will"<U+2014>a term which described his ability to punish or financially destroy particular barons or clergy.<ref name=HuscroftP170MasonP128>Huscroft, pp.70, 170; Mason, p.128.</ref> 

In England, Henry initially ruled through his father's former advisers whom he brought with him from Normandy, and through some of Henry I's remaining officials, reinforced with some of Stephen's senior nobility who made their peace with Henry in 1153.<ref>King (2007), pp.43<U+2013>44.</ref> During his reign Henry, like his grandfather, increasingly promoted "[[new men]]", minor nobles without independent wealth and lands, to positions of authority in England.<ref>Peltzer, p.1203.</ref> By the 1180s this new class of royal administrators was predominant in England, supported by various illegitimate members of Henry's family.<ref>Peltzer, p.1203; Jones, p.28.</ref> In Normandy, the links between the two halves of the Anglo-Norman nobility had weakened during the first half of the 12th century, and continued to do so under Henry.<ref>Power (2007), pp.94<U+2013>95; Bates (2003), p.207.</ref> Henry drew his close advisers from the ranks of the Norman bishops and, as in England, recruited many "new men" as Norman administrators: few of the larger landowners in Normandy benefited from the king's patronage.<ref>Power (2007), pp.98, 116<U+2013>117.</ref> Henry frequently intervened with the Norman nobility through arranged marriages or the treatment of inheritances, either using his authority as duke or his influence as king of England over their lands there: Henry's rule was a harsh one. Across the rest of France, local administration was less developed: Anjou was governed through a combination of officials called ''[[Provost (civil)|pr<U+00E9>v<U+00F4>t]]s'' and seneschals based along the Loire and in western Touraine, but Henry had few officials elsewhere in the region.<ref>Gillingham (1984), p.35; Aurell, p.38.</ref> In Aquitaine, ducal authority remained very limited, despite increasing significantly during Henry's reign, largely thanks to Richard's efforts in the late 1170s.<ref>Gillingham (1984), pp.35, 38.</ref>

In the aftermath of disorders of Stephen's reign in England there were many legal cases concerning land to be resolved: many [[Monastery|religious houses]] had lost land during the conflict, while in other cases owners and heirs had been dispossessed of their property by local barons, which in some cases had since been sold or given to new owners.<ref>White (2000), pp.162<U+2013>163.</ref> Henry relied on traditional, local courts<U+2014>such as the [[shire court]]s, [[Hundred (county subdivision)|hundred courts]] and in particular seignorial courts<U+2014>to deal with most of these cases, hearing only a few personally.<ref>White (2000), pp.162, 174.</ref> This process was far from perfect and in many cases claimants were unable to pursue their cases effectively.<ref>White (2000), p.166.</ref> While interested in the law, during the first years of his reign Henry was preoccupied with other political issues and even finding the king for a hearing could mean travelling across the Channel and locating Henry's peripatetic court.<ref>White (2000), pp.170<U+2013>171, 174.</ref> Nonetheless, Henry was prepared to take action to improve the existing procedures, intervening in cases which he felt had been mishandled, and creating legislation to improve both ecclesiastical and civil court processes.<ref>White (2000), pp.177, 179.</ref> Meanwhile, in neighbouring Normandy, Henry delivered justice through the courts run by his officials across the duchy and occasionally these cases made their way to the king himself.<ref>Power (2007), p.103.</ref> Henry also operated an [[exchequer court]] that heard cases relating to royal revenues at [[Caen]] and maintained a number of king's [[judge|justices]] who travelled across the duchy.<ref>Power (2007), p.104.</ref> Between 1159 and 1163 Henry spent time in Normandy conducting reforms of royal and church courts and some measures later introduced in England are recorded as existing in Normandy as early as 1159.<ref>White (2000), pp.18, 215.</ref>

===Relations with the church===
[[File:Reading Abbey interior.jpg|thumb|[[Reading Abbey]], one of Henry's favoured religious institutions]]
Henry's relationship with the church varied considerably across his lands and over time: as with other aspects of his rule, there was no attempt to form a common ecclesiastical policy.<ref>Alexander, p.23.</ref> In so far as Henry had a policy it was to generally push back on papal influence, increasing his own local authority.<ref>Duggan (1962), p.1.</ref> The 12th century had seen a reforming movement within the church, however, advocating greater autonomy from royal authority for the clergy and more influence for the papacy.<ref>Duggan (1965), p.67, cited Alexander, p.3.</ref> This trend had already caused tensions in England, for example when King Stephen, forced [[Theobald of Bec]], the Archbishop of Canterbury, into exile in 1152.<ref>Alexander, pp.2<U+2013>3.</ref> There were also long running concerns over the legal treatment of members of the clergy.<ref>Alexander, p.10.</ref> 

By contrast with the tensions in England, in Normandy Henry had occasional disagreements with the church but generally enjoyed very good relations with the Norman bishops.<ref>Peltzer, pp.1212, 1227.</ref> In Brittany, Henry had the support of the local church hierarchy and rarely intervened in clerical matters, except occasionally in order to cause difficulties for his rival Louis of France.<ref>Everard (2000), p.63.</ref> Further south, however, the power of the dukes of Aquitaine over the local church was much less than in the north, and Henry's efforts to extend his influence over local appointments created tensions.<ref>Turner (2011), p.179-180.</ref> During the [[Papal election, 1159|disputed papal election]] of 1159, Henry, like Louis, supported Alexander III over his rival [[Antipope Victor IV (1159<U+2013>1164)|Victor IV]].<ref>Barlow (1936), p.264.</ref>

Henry was not an especially pious king by medieval standards.<ref>Martinson, pp.1, 3.</ref> In England, Henry provided steady patronage to the monastic houses, but established few new monasteries and was relatively conservative in determining which he did support, favouring those with established links to his family, such as [[Reading Abbey]].<ref>Martinson, pp.iii, 261.</ref> In this regard Henry's religious tastes appear to have been influenced by his mother, and indeed before his ascension a number of religious charters were issued in their joint names.<ref>Martinson, p.6.</ref> Henry did found a number of religious [[hospital]]s in England and France.<ref>Martinson, p.262.</ref> After the death of Becket, Henry built and endowed various monasteries in France, primarily to improve his popular image.<ref>Martinson, p.3.</ref> Since travel by sea during the period was dangerous, Henry would also take full [[confession]] before setting sail and use [[augur]]ies to determine the best time to travel.<ref>Vincent (2007b), pp.306<U+2013>307.</ref> Henry's movements may also have been planned to take advantage of [[Calendar of saints|saints' days]] and other fortuitous occasions.<ref>Vincent (2007b), p.308.</ref>

===Economy and finance===
[[File:Henry II Penny.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Penny]] of Henry II]]
Henry restored many of the old financial institutions of his grandfather Henry I and undertook further, long-lasting reforms of the way of the English currency was managed; one result was a long term increase in the [[Money supply|supply of money]] within the economy, leading to a growth both in trade and [[inflation]].<ref>Barratt, p.243; Allen, p.257; White (2000), pp.130, 159.</ref> Medieval rulers such as Henry enjoyed various sources of income during the 12th century. Some of their income came from their private estates, called ''[[demesne]]''; other income came from imposing legal [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] and arbitrary [[amercement]]s, and lastly from [[tax]]es, which at this time were raised only intermittently.<ref>Carpenter, pp.154<U+2013>155.</ref> Kings could also raise funds by borrowing; Henry did this far more than earlier English rulers, initially through moneylenders in [[Rouen]], turning later in his reign to [[Jew]]ish and [[Flanders|Flemish]] lenders.<ref>Musset, pp.10<U+2013>11, cited Bates (1994, p.32; Carpenter, p.201.</ref> Ready cash was increasingly important to rulers during the 12th century to enable the use of mercenary forces and the construction of stone castles, both vital to successful military campaigns.<ref>Turner (2011), pp.136<U+2013>137.</ref>

Henry inherited a difficult situation in England in 1154. Henry I had established a system of royal finances that depended upon three key institutions: a central royal [[treasury]] in London, supported by treasuries in key castles; the [[exchequer]] that accounted for payments to the treasuries; and a team of royal officials called the chamber that followed the king's travels, spending money as necessary and collecting revenues along the way.<ref>White (2000), p.131; Gillingham (1984), p.49; Vincent (2007b), p.299.</ref> The long civil war had caused considerable disruption to this system and some figures suggest that royal income fell by 46% between 1129<U+2013>30 and 1155<U+2013>56.<ref>White (2000), p.130.</ref> A new coin, called the [[Awbridge]] silver [[penny]], had been issued in 1153 in an attempt to stabilise the English currency after the war.<ref>Allen, pp.258<U+2013>259.</ref> Less is known about how financial affairs were managed in Henry's continental possessions, but a very similar system operated in Normandy, and a comparable system probably operated in both Anjou and Aquitaine.<ref>Gillingham (1984), p.49.</ref> 

On taking power Henry gave a high priority to the restoration of royal finances in England, reviving Henry I's financial processes and attempting to improve the quality of the royal accounting.<ref>White (2000), pp.130, 159.</ref> Revenue from the demesne formed the bulk of Henry's income in England, although taxes were used heavily in the first 11 years of his reign.<ref>Barratt, p.250; White (2000), p.150.</ref> Aided by the capable [[Richard FitzNeal]], Henry reformed the currency in 1158, putting his name on English coins for the first time and heavily reducing the number of [[moneyer]]s licensed to produce coins.<ref>Allen, pp.260<U+2013>261; Warren (2000), p.268.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Henry inherited an old system of mints distributed around the country in the form of small, local workshops.<ref>Allen, p.275; Barratt, p.247.</ref> These mints made money for the crown by taking a proportion of the silver melted down when old coins were brought into be replaced and passing some of this to the crown.<ref>Allen, pp.264<U+2013>265.</ref> Historian Pamela Nightingale has put forward a theory that the 1158 reforms involved the dismissal of a previous class of royal moneyers; Martin Allen has however critiqued the evidence base for this theory.<ref>Nightingale, pp.61<U+2013>63, cited Allen p.260; Allen, p.260.</ref>|group="nb"}} These measures were successful in improving his income, but on his return to England in the 1160s Henry took further steps.<ref>White (2000), p.159.</ref> New taxes were introduced and the existing accounts [[audit|re-audited]], and the reforms of the legal system brought in new streams of money from fines and amercements.<ref>White (2000), p.159; Barratt, p.251.</ref> A wholesale reform of the coinage occurred in 1180, with royal officials taking direct control of the mints and passing the profits directly to the treasury.<ref>Allen, p.268.</ref> A new penny, called the Short Cross, was introduced, with the number of mints reduced substantially to ten across the country.<ref>Allen, pp.269<U+2013>271.</ref> Driven by the reforms, the royal revenues increased significantly; during the first part of the reign, Henry's average exchequer income was only around <U+00A3>18,000; after 1166, the average was around <U+00A3>22,000.<ref>Barratt, p.249.</ref> One economic effect of these changes was a substantial increase in the amount of money in circulation in England and, post-1180, a significant increase in both long-term inflation and trade.<ref>Barratt, p.243; Allen, p.257.</ref>

==Later reign (1162<U+2013>75)==

===Developments in France===
[[File:Jindra Eleonora.jpg|thumb|150px|14th century representation of Henry and Eleanor]]
The long-running tensions between Henry and Louis VII continued during the 1160s, with the French king slowly becoming more vigorous in opposing Henry's increasing power in Europe.<ref name=HallamEverardP161/> In 1160 Louis strengthened his alliances with the Count of Champagne and Odo the [[Odo II, Duke of Burgundy|Duke of Burgundy]] in central France, and in 1163 the new Count of Flanders, [[Philip I, Count of Flanders|Philip]], concerned about Henry's growing power, allied himself open with the French king.<ref>Dunbabin, p.52; Hallam and Everard, p.161.</ref> Louis's wife Ad<U+00E8>le gave birth to a male heir, [[Philip Augustus]], in 1165 and Louis was more confident of his own position than for many years previously.<ref>Warren (2000), p.104.</ref> As a result, relations between Henry and Louis deteriorated again in the mid-1160s.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.103<U+2013>104.</ref> 

Meanwhile, Henry had begun to alter his policy of indirect rule in Brittany and started to exert more direct control.<ref>Everard (2000), pp.41<U+2013>42.</ref> In 1164 Henry intervened to seize lands along the border of Brittany and Normandy, and in 1166 invaded Brittany to punish the local barons.<ref name=Everard2000P42>Everard (2000), p.42.</ref> Henry then forced Conan to abdicate as duke and to give Brittany to his daughter Constance; Constance was handed over and betrothed to Henry's son Geoffrey.<ref name=Everard2000P42/>{{#tag:ref|The arrangement in 1166 was quite unusual in terms of medieval law, as Conan might have had sons who could have legitimately inherited the duchy; Henry never formally became Duke of Brittany as he was only holding the duchy on behalf of Geoffrey and Constance.<ref>Everard (2000), pp.43<U+2013>44.</ref>|group="nb"}} Elsewhere in France, Henry attempted to seize the [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], much to the anger of the French king.<ref name=Warren2000P105>Warren (2000), p.105.</ref> Further south Henry continued to apply pressure on Raymond of Toulouse: the king campaigned there personally in 1161, sent the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bordeaux|Archbishop of Bordeaux]] against Raymond in 1164 and encouraged [[Alfonso II of Aragon]] in his attacks.<ref name=Gillingham1984P27>Gillingham (1984), p.27.</ref> In 1165 Raymond divorced Louis's sister and attempted to ally himself with Henry instead.<ref name=Warren2000P105/> 

These growing tensions between Henry and Louis finally spilled over into open war in 1167, triggered by a trivial argument over how money destined for the [[Crusader states]] of the [[Levant]] should be collected.<ref name=Warren2000P105/> Louis allied himself with the Welsh, Scots and Bretons and the French king attacked Normandy.<ref>Dunbabin, p.59.</ref> Henry responded by attacking Chaumont-sur-Epte, where Louis kept his main military arsenal, burning the town to the ground and forcing Louis to abandon his allies and make a private truce.<ref>Dunbabin, p.59; Warren (2000), p.106.</ref> Henry was then free to move against the rebel barons in Brittany, where feelings about Henry's seizure of the duchy were still running high.<ref>Everard (2000), pp.45<U+2013>46.</ref> 

As the decade progressed, Henry increasingly wanted to resolve the question of the inheritance. Henry decided that he would divide up his empire after his death, with Young Henry receiving England and Normandy, Richard the Duchy of Aquitaine, and Geoffrey Brittany.<ref>Hallam and Everard, p.223.</ref> This would require the consent of Louis as king of France and accordingly Henry and Louis held fresh peace talks in 1169 at [[Montmirail, Marne|Montmirail]].<ref>Warren, p.497.</ref> The talks were wide ranging, and culminated with Henry's sons giving homage to Louis for their future inheritances in France, and Richard being betrothed to Louis's daughter Alice.<ref>Dubabin, p.59; Warren (2000), p.109.</ref> 

If the agreements at Montmirail had been followed up, the acts of homage could potentially have confirmed Louis's position as king, while undermining the legitimacy of any rebellious barons within Henry's territories and the potential for an alliance between them and Louis.<ref>Everard (2000), p.47.</ref> In practice, however, Louis perceived himself to have gained a temporary advantage and immediately after the conference began to encourage tensions between Henry's sons.<ref>Hallam and Everard, p.162.</ref> Meanwhile, Henry's position in the south of France continued to improve and by 1173 he had agreed an alliance with [[Umberto III, Count of Savoy|Humbert]], the [[Count of Savoy]], which betrothed Henry's son John and Humbert's daughter Alicia.<ref name=Gillingham1984P27/>{{#tag:ref|Alicia died before the marriage could take place, although the alliance remained intact.<ref>Gillingham (1984), p.27.</ref>|group="nb"}} Henry's daughter Eleanor was married to [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] in 1170, enlisting an additional ally in the south.<ref name=Gillingham1984P27/> In February 1173 Raymond finally gave in and publicly gave homage for Toulouse to Henry and his heirs.<ref name=Gillingham1984P27/>

===Thomas Becket controversy===
{{Main article|Becket controversy}}
[[Image:Thomas Becket Murder.JPG|thumb|13th century depiction of the death of Thomas Becket]]

One of the major international events surrounding Henry during the 1160s was the Becket controversy. When the Archbishop of Canterbury, Theobald of Bec, died in 1161 Henry saw an opportunity to reassert his rights over the church in England.<ref>Huscroft, pp.192<U+2013>195.</ref> Henry appointed Thomas Becket, his English [[Chancellor]], as archbishop in 1162, probably believing that Becket, in addition to being an old friend, would be politically weakened within the church because of his former role as Chancellor and reliant on Henry's support.<ref>Jones, p.30.</ref> Both Matilda and Eleanor appear to have had doubts about the appointment, but Henry continued regardless.<ref>Chibnall, p.167; Turner (2011), pp.139<U+2013>140.</ref> Henry's plan did not have the desired result, however, as Becket promptly changed his lifestyle, abandoned his links to the king and portrayed himself as a staunch protector of church rights.<ref>Barlow (1986), pp.74<U+2013>76, 83.</ref>

Henry and Becket quickly disagreed over a number of issues, including Becket's attempts to regain control of lands belonging to the archbishopric and his views on Henry's taxation policies.<ref>Barlow (1986), pp.83<U+2013>84, 88<U+2013>89.</ref> The main source of conflict, however, concerned the treatment of clergy who committed secular crimes: Henry argued that the legal custom in England allowed the king to enforce justice over these clerics, while Becket maintained that only church courts could try the cases. The matter came to a head in January 1164, where Henry forced through agreement to the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]]; under huge pressure, Becket temporarily agreed but changed his position shortly afterwards.<ref>Barlow (1986), pp.98<U+2013>100.</ref> The legal argument was complex at the time and remains contentious.<ref>Alexander, pp.6, 11.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Current academic opinion broadly maintains that Henry was right to assert that the Constitutions represented the existing customs in England, but that Becket was also correct to argue that these customs were not in accordance with [[Canon law|ecclesiastical law]].<ref>Alexander, pp.6, 11<U+2013>13.</ref>|group="nb"}}

The argument between Henry and Becket became both increasingly personal and international in nature. Henry was stubborn and bore grudges, while Becket was vain, ambitious and overly political: neither man was willing to back down.<ref>Alexander, p.6.</ref> Both Henry and Becket sought the support of Alexander III and other international leaders, arguing their positions in various forums across Europe.<ref>Barlow (1986), pp.143<U+2013>147.</ref> The situation worsened in 1164 when Becket fled to France to seek sanctuary with Henry's enemy, Louis VII.<ref>Barlow (1986), pp.108<U+2013>114</ref> Henry harassed Becket's associates in England, and Becket [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] religious and secular officials who sided with the king.<ref>Barlow (1986), pp.144<U+2013>148.</ref> The pope supported Becket's case in principle but needed Henry's support in dealing with [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor]], so he repeatedly sought a negotiated solution; the Norman Church also intervened to try to assist Henry in finding a solution.<ref>Peltzer, pp.1215<U+2013>1215.</ref>

By 1169, however, Henry had decided to crown his son Young Henry as king of England. This required the acquiescence of Becket as the Archbishop of Canterbury, traditionally the churchman with the right to conduct the ceremony. Furthermore, the whole Becket matter had become an increasing international embarrassment to Henry. Henry began to take a more conciliatory tone with Becket, but, when this failed, Henry had Young Henry crowned anyway by the Archbishop of York. Becket was allowed to lay an [[Interdict (Roman Catholic Church)|interdict]] on England, forcing Henry back to negotiations; they finally came to terms in July 1170, and Becket returned to England in early December. Just when the dispute seemed resolved, however, Becket excommunicated another three supporters of Henry: the king was furious, and infamously announced "What miserable drones and traitors have I nourished and promoted in my household, who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born clerk!"<ref>Barlow (1986), pp.234<U+2013>235.</ref> 

In response, four knights made their way secretly to [[Canterbury]], apparently with the intent of confronting and if necessary arresting Becket for breaking his agreement with Henry.<ref>Barlow (1986), p.236.</ref> The Archbishop refused to be arrested by relatively low-born knights and was hacked to death by them on 29 December 1170.<ref>Barlow (1986), pp.246<U+2013>248.</ref> This event, particularly in front of an altar, horrified Christian Europe. Although Becket had not been popular while he was alive, in death he was declared a [[martyr]] by the local monks.<ref>Barlow (1986), p.250.</ref> Louis seized on the case and, despite efforts by the Norman church to prevent the French church from taking action, a new interdict was announced on Henry's possessions.<ref>Peltzer, pp.1216<U+2013>1217.</ref> Henry was focused on dealing with Ireland and took no action to arrest Becket's killers, arguing that he was unable to do so.<ref>Barlow (1986), pp.257<U+2013>258.</ref> International pressure on Henry grew and in May 1172 Henry negotiated a [[Compromise of Avranches|settlement with the papacy]] in which the king swore to go on crusade as well as effectively also overturning the Constitutions of Clarendon.<ref>Barlow (1986), p.261.</ref> In the coming years, although Henry never actually went on his crusade, he exploited the growing "cult of Becket" for his own ends.<ref>Barlow (1986), p.272; Weiler, pp.36, 39.</ref>

===Invasion of Ireland===
{{Main article|Norman invasion of Ireland}}
[[File:Ireland 1173.jpg|thumb|Kingdoms of Ireland in 1171, and arrow showing Henry's invasion]]
In the mid-12th century Ireland was ruled by a number of local [[List of Irish kings|kings]], although their authority was more limited than their counterparts in the rest of western Europe.<ref>Warren, pp.187<U+2013>188.</ref> Mainstream Europeans regarded the Irish as relatively barbarous and backward.<ref>Warren, p.188; Davies, p.9.</ref> In the 1160s King [[Diarmait Mac Murchada|Dermot]] of [[List of kings of Leinster|Leinster]] was driven out of [[Dublin]] by his rival, the [[List of kings of Connacht|king of Connacht]]; Dermot turned to Henry for assistance in 1167 and the English king agreed to allow Dermot to recruit mercenaries within his empire.<ref>Warren, p.192.</ref> Dermot put together a force of Anglo-Norman and Flemish mercenaries drawn from the [[Welsh Marches]], including [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Richard de Clare]].<ref>Warren, pp.192<U+2013>193.</ref> With his new supporters, Dermot reclaimed Leinster but died shortly afterwards in 1171; de Clare then claimed Leinster for himself, but the situation in Ireland was tense and the Anglo-Normans heavily outnumbered.<ref>Warren, p.194.</ref>

Henry took this opportunity to intervene personally in Ireland. He took a large army into south Wales, forcing the rebels who had held the area since 1165 into submission prior to sailing from [[Pembroke, Pembrokeshire|Pembroke]] and landing in Ireland October 1171.<ref>Carpenter, p.215.</ref> Some of the Irish lords appealed to Henry to protect them from the Anglo-Norman invaders, while de Clare offered to submit to Henry if he was allowed to retain his new possessions.<ref>Warren, p.194.</ref> Henry's timing was influenced by several factors, including encouragement from Pope Alexander, who saw the opportunity to establish papal authority over the [[Christianity in Ireland|Irish church]].<ref>Bull, p.124; Warren, p.197.</ref> The critical factor though appears to have been Henry's concern that his nobles in the Welsh Marches would acquire independent territories of their own in Ireland, beyond the reach of his authority.<ref>Davies, pp.68<U+2013>69.</ref> Henry's intervention was successful and both the Irish and Anglo-Normans in the south and east of Ireland accepted his rule.<ref>Warren, p.200.</ref> 

Henry undertook a [[Castles in Great Britain and Ireland#The spread of castles in Scotland, Wales and Ireland|wave of castle-building]] during his visit in 1171 to protect his new territories<U+2014>the Anglo-Normans had superior military technologies to the Irish, and castles gave them a significant advantage.<ref>Carpenter, pp. 220<U+2013>21; Davies, p.41.</ref> Henry hoped for a longer term political solution, however, similar to his approach in Wales and Scotland, and in 1175 he agreed the Treaty of Windsor, under which [[Ruaidr<U+00ED> Ua Conchobair|Rory O'Connor]] would be recognised as the [[high king of Ireland]], giving homage to Henry and maintaining stability on the ground on his behalf.<ref>Warren, p.203.</ref> This policy proved unsuccessful, as O'Connor was unable to exert sufficient influence and force in areas such as [[List of kings of Munster|Munster]]: Henry instead intervened more directly, establishing a system of local fiefs of his own through a conference held in [[Oxford]] in 1177.<ref>Warren, p.203; Davies, pp.64<U+2013>65, 78.</ref>

[[File:Great Revolt Normandy 1173.png|thumb|350px|Events in Normandy, summer 1173]]
In 1173 Henry faced the [[Revolt of 1173<U+2013>1174|Great Revolt]], an uprising by his eldest sons and rebellious barons, supported by France, Scotland and Flanders. A number of grievances underpinned the revolt. Young Henry was unhappy that, despite the title of king, in practice he made no real decisions and was kept chronically short of money by Henry.<ref>Jones, pp.29, 33<U+2013>34.</ref> Young Henry had also been very attached to Thomas Becket, his former tutor, and may have held his father responsible for Becket's death.<ref>Jones, p.30.</ref> Geoffrey faced similar difficulties; Duke Conan of Brittany had died in 1171, but Geoffrey and Constance were still unmarried, leaving his son in limbo without his own lands.<ref>Everard (2000), pp.47<U+2013>48.</ref> Richard was encouraged to join the revolt as well by Eleanor, whose relationship with Henry, as previously described, had disintegrated.<ref>Huscroft, p.142.</ref> Meanwhile, local barons unhappy with Henry's rule saw opportunities to recover traditional powers and influence by allying themselves with his sons.<ref>Aurell, p.54-56; Jones, p.24; Turner (2011), p.226.</ref> 

The final straw was Henry's decision to give his youngest son John three major castles belonging to Young Henry, who first protested and then fled to Paris, followed by his brothers Richard and Geoffrey; Eleanor attempted to join them but was captured by Henry's forces in November.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.117<U+2013>118.</ref> Louis supported Young Henry and war became imminent.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.118, 121.</ref> Young Henry wrote to the pope, complaining about his father's behaviour, and began to acquire allies, including King [[William the Lion|William of Scotland]] and the Counts of Boulogne, Flanders and Blois<U+2014>all of whom were promised lands if Young Henry won.<ref>Weiler, pp.20, 39<U+2013>40; Warren (2000), pp.121<U+2013>122.</ref> Major baronial revolts broke out in England, Brittany, Maine, Poitou and [[Angoul<U+00EA>me]].<ref name=Warren2000P122>Warren (2000), p.122.</ref> In Normandy some of the border barons rose up and, although the majority of the duchy remained openly loyal, there appears to have been a wider undercurrent of discontent.<ref>Bates (2003), pp.85<U+2013>87.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Earlier historical opinion emphasised the loyalty of the Duchy of Normandy during the Great Revolt; more recent scholarship, however, has altered this perspective and highlighted the prevailing tensions.<ref>Bates (1994), p.32; Bates (2003), p.87.</ref>|group="nb"}} Only Anjou proved relatively secure.<ref name=Warren2000P122/> Despite the size and scope of the crisis, Henry had several advantages, including his control of a large number of powerful royal castles in strategic areas, control of most of the English ports throughout the war, and his continuing popularity within the towns across his empire.<ref>Warren (2000), p.123; Jones, pp.35<U+2013>36, 38; Carpenter, p.197.</ref> 

In May 1173 Louis and the Young King probed the defences of the Vexin, the main route to the Norman capital, Rouen; armies invaded from Flanders and Blois, attempting a pincer movement, while rebels from Brittany invaded from the west.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.125<U+2013>127.</ref> Henry secretly travelled back to England to order an offensive on the rebels, and on his return counter-attacked Louis's army, massacring many of them and pushing them back across the border.<ref>Warren (2000), p.127-128.</ref> An army was dispatched to drive back the Brittany rebels, whom Henry then pursued, surprised and captured.<ref name=Warren2000P128>Warren (2000), p.128.</ref> Henry offered to negotiate with his sons, but these discussions at [[Gisors]] soon broke down.<ref name=Warren2000P128/> Meanwhile the fighting in England proved evenly balanced until a royal army defeated a superior force of rebel and Flemish reinforcements in September at [[Fornham]] in [[East Anglia]].<ref>Warren (2000), pp.129<U+2013>131.</ref> Henry took advantage of this respite to crush the rebel strongholds in Touraine, securing the strategically important route through his empire.<ref name=Warren2000P132>Warren (2000), p.132.</ref> In January 1174 the Young Henry and Louis's forces attacked again, threatening to push through into central Normandy.<ref name=Warren2000P132/> The attack failed and the fighting paused while the winter weather set in.<ref name=Warren2000P132/> 

In early 1174 Henry's enemies appeared to have tried to lure Henry back into England, allowing them to attack Normandy in his absence.<ref name=Warren2000P132/> As part of this plan, William of Scotland attacked south into England, supported by the northern English rebels; further Scottish forces were sent into the Midlands where the rebel barons were making good progress.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.132, 134.</ref> Henry refused the bait and instead focused on crushing opposition in south-west France, and William's campaign began to falter as the Scots failed to take the key northern royal castles, in part due to the efforts of Henry's illegitimate son, Geoffrey.<ref>Warren (2000), p.134.</ref> In an effort to reinvigorate the plan, Philip, the Count of Flanders, announced his intention to invade England and sent an advance force into East Anglia.<ref>Warren (2000), p.134-135.</ref> The prospective Flemish invasion forced Henry to return to England in early July.<ref name=Warren2000P135>Warren (2000), p.135.</ref> Louis and Philip could now push overland land into eastern Normandy and reached Rouen.<ref name=Warren2000P135/> Henry travelled to Becket's tomb in Canterbury, where he announced that the rebellion was a divine punishment on him, and took appropriate penance; this made a major difference in restoring his royal authority at a critical moment in the conflict.<ref>Weiler, pp.36, 39.</ref> Word then reached Henry that King William had been defeated and captured by local forces at [[Alnwick]], crushing the rebel cause in the north.<ref name=Warren2000P135/> The remaining English rebel strongholds collapsed and in August Henry returned to Normandy.<ref name=Warren2000P136>Warren (2000), p.136.</ref> Louis had not yet been able to take Rouen and Henry's forces fell upon the French army just before the final French assault on the city began; pushed back into France, Louis requested peace talks, bringing an end to the conflict.<ref name=Warren2000P136/>

===Aftermath of the Great Revolt===

In the aftermath of the Great Revolt, Henry held negotiations at Montlouis, offering a lenient peace on the basis of the pre-war status quo.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.136, 139.</ref> Henry and Young Henry swore not to take revenge on each other's followers; Young Henry agreed to the transfer of the disputed castles to John, but in exchange the elder Henry agreed to give the younger Henry two castles in Normandy and 15,000 [[Angevin pound]]s; Richard and Geoffrey were granted half the revenues from Aquitaine and Brittany respectively.<ref name=Warren2000P138>Warren (2000), p.138.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Accurately converting 12th century financial sums into modern equivalents is impossible; for comparison 15,000 [[Angevin pound]]s equated to <U+00A3>3,750 English pounds, at a time when the average English baron enjoyed an annual income of around <U+00A3>200.<ref>Turner (2011), pp.166, 229.</ref>|group="nb"}} Eleanor, however, was kept under effective [[house arrest]] until the 1180s.<ref>Warren (2000), p.138; Turner (2011), p.245.</ref> The rebel barons were kept imprisoned for a short time and in some cases fined, then restored to their lands.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.139<U+2013>140.</ref> The rebel castles in England and Aquitaine were destroyed.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.140<U+2013>142.</ref> Henry was less generous to William of Scotland, who was not released until he had agreed to the [[Treaty of Falaise]] in December 1174, under which he publicly gave homage to Henry and surrendered five key Scottish castles to Henry's men.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.138<U+2013>139.</ref> Philip of Flanders declared his neutrality towards Henry, in return for which the king agreed to provide him with regular financial support.<ref>Dunbabin, p.52.</ref>

Henry now appeared to his contemporaries to be stronger than ever, and he was courted as an ally by many European leaders and asked to arbitrate over international disputes in Spain and Germany.<ref>Warren (2000), p.143; Aurell, p.27.</ref> Henry was nonetheless busy resolving some the weaknesses that he believed had exacerbated the revolt. He set about extending royal justice in England to reassert his authority and spent time in Normandy shoring up support amongst the barons.<ref>Bates (2003), p.87; Brand, p.232.</ref> The king also made use of the growing Becket cult to increase his own prestige, using the power of the saint to explain his victory in 1174, especially his success in capturing William.<ref>Bull, p.115.</ref> 

The 1174 peace did not deal with the long-running tensions between Henry and Louis, however, and these resurfaced during the late 1170s.<ref name=Warren2000P144>Warren (2000), p.144.</ref> The two kings now began to compete for control of [[Berry (province)|Berry]], a prosperous region of value to both kings.<ref name=Warren2000P144/> Henry had some rights to western Berry, but in 1176 Henry announced an extraordinary claim that he had agreed in 1169 to give Richard's fianc<U+00E9>e Alice the whole province as part of the marriage settlement.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.144<U+2013>145.</ref> If Louis had accepted this, it would have implied that the Berry was Henry's to give away in the first place, and would have given Henry the right to occupy it on Richard's behalf.<ref>Warren (2000), p.145.</ref> To put additional pressure on Louis, Henry mobilised his armies for war.<ref name=Warren2000P144/> The papacy intervened and, probably as Henry had planned, the two kings were encouraged to sign a non-aggression treaty in September 1177, under which they promised to undertake a joint [[crusade]].<ref>Warren (2000), p.145.</ref> The ownership of the Auvergne and parts of the Berry were put to an [[arbitration]] panel, which reported in favour of Henry; Henry followed up this success by purchasing [[La Marche, Ni<U+00E8>vre|La Marche]] from the local count.<ref>Warren (2000), p.146.</ref> This expansion of Henry's empire once again threatened French security and promptly put the new peace at risk.<ref>Warren (2000), p.147.</ref>

===Family tensions===
[[File:Richard Lionheart and Philip Augustus.jpg|thumb|13th century representation of [[Richard I of England|Richard]] and [[Philip Augustus]]]]
In the late 1170s Henry focused on trying to create a stable system of government, increasingly ruling through his family, but tensions over the succession arrangements were never far away, ultimately leading to a fresh revolt.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.561<U+2013>562.</ref> Having quelled the left-over rebels from the Great Revolt, Richard was recognised by Henry as the Duke of Aquitaine in 1179.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.563, 573.</ref> In 1181 Geoffrey finally married Constance and became Duke of Brittany; by now most of Brittany accepted Angevin rule, and Geoffrey was able to deal with the remaining disturbances on his own.<ref>Warren (2000), p.563; Everard (2000), pp.50, 53.</ref> John had spent the Great Revolt travelling alongside his father and most observers now began to regard the prince as Henry's favourite child.<ref>Turner (2009), p.36.</ref> Henry began to grant John more lands, mostly at various nobles' expense, and in 1177 he was made the [[Lordship of Ireland|Lord of Ireland]].<ref name=TurnerP37>Turner (2009), p.37.</ref> Meanwhile, Young Henry spent the end of the decade travelling in Europe, taking part in tournaments and playing only a passing role in either government or Henry and Richard's military campaigns; he was increasingly discontent with his position and lack of power.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.581<U+2013>582.</ref> 

By 1182 Young Henry reiterated his previous demands: he wanted to be granted lands, for example the Duchy of Normandy, which would allow him to support himself and his household with dignity.<ref name=WarrenP584>Warren (2000), p.584.</ref> Henry refused, but agreed to increase his son's allowance, but this was not enough to placate Young Henry.<ref name=WarrenP584/> With trouble clearly brewing, Henry attempted to defuse the situation by insisting that Richard and Geoffrey give homage to Young Henry for their lands.<ref>Warren (2000), p.587.</ref> Richard did not believe that Young Henry had any claim over Aquitaine and refused to give homage; when Henry forced Richard to give homage, Young Henry then angrily refused to accept it.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.587<U+2013>588.</ref> Young Henry formed an alliance with some of the disgruntled barons of the Aquitaine who were unhappy with Richard's rule, and Geoffrey sided with him, raising a mercenary army in Brittany to threaten Poitou.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.586<U+2013>589, 592.</ref> Open war broke out in 1183 and Henry and Richard led a joint campaign into Aquitaine: before they could conclude it, however, Young Henry caught a fever and died, bringing a sudden end to the rebellion.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.592<U+2013>593.</ref>

With his eldest son dead, Henry rearranged the plans for the succession: Richard was to be made king of England, albeit without any actual power until the death of his father; Geoffrey would have to retain Brittany, as he held it by marriage, so Henry's favourite son John would become the duke of Aquitaine in place of Richard.<ref name=TurnerP37/> Richard, however, refused to give up Aquitaine; he was deeply attached to the duchy, and had no desire to exchange this role for the meaningless one of being the junior King of England.<ref>Turner (2009), p.37; Warren (2000), p.596.</ref> Henry was furious, and ordered John and Geoffrey to march south and retake the duchy by force.<ref name=TurnerP37/> The short war ended in stalemate and a tense family reconciliation at Westminster in England at the end of 1184.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.596<U+2013>597; Turner (2009), p.37.</ref> Henry finally got his own way in early 1185 by bringing Eleanor to Normandy to instruct Richard to obey his father, while simultaneously threatening to give Normandy, and possibly England, to Geoffrey.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.597<U+2013>598; Turner (2011), p.248.</ref> This proved enough and Richard finally handed over the ducal castles in Aquitaine to Henry.<ref name=Warren2000P598>Warren (2000), p.598.</ref>

Meanwhile, John undertook an [[John's first expedition to Ireland|expedition to Ireland]] in 1185, which was not a success. Ireland had only recently been conquered by Anglo-Norman forces, and tensions were still rife between Henry's representatives, the new settlers and the existing inhabitants.<ref name=WarrenP36>Warren (1991), p.36.</ref> John offended the [[List of Irish kingdoms|local Irish rulers]], failed to make allies amongst the Anglo-Norman settlers, began to lose ground militarily against the Irish and finally returned to England within the year.<ref name=WarrenP36/> In 1186 Henry was about to return John to Ireland once again, when news came that Geoffrey had died in a tournament at Paris, leaving two young children; this event once again changed the balance of power between Henry and his remaining sons.<ref name=Warren2000P598/>

===Henry and Philip Augustus===
[[Image:Philippe2+Henri2+Cross.jpg|thumb|Early 14th century depiction of Henry and Philip Augustus taking the cross for the [[Third Crusade]]]]
Henry's relationship with his two surviving heirs was fraught, for, while the king had great affection for his youngest son John, he showed little warmth towards Richard and indeed seems to have borne him a grudge after their argument in 1184.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.600<U+2013>601.</ref> The bickering and simmering tensions between Henry and Richard were cleverly exploited by the new French king, [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]].<ref name=Warren2000P602>Warren (2000), p.602.</ref> Philip had come to power in 1180 and he rapidly demonstrated that he could be an assertive, calculating and manipulative political leader.<ref>Everard and Hallam, pp.164<U+2013>165.</ref> Initially Henry and Philip Augustus had enjoyed a good relationship. Despite attempts to divide the two, Henry and Philip Augustus agreed a joint alliance, even though this cost the French king the support of Flanders and Champagne.<ref>Hallam and Everard, p.166; Dunbabin, p.52.</ref> Philip Augustus regarded Geoffrey as a close friend, and would have welcomed him as a successor to Henry.<ref>Everard and Hallam, p.166; Warren (2000), p.611.</ref> With the death of Geoffrey, however, the relationship between Henry and Philip broke down.<ref>Hallam and Everard, p.166.</ref> 

In 1186, Philip Augustus demanded that he be given custody of Geoffrey's children and Brittany, and insisted that Henry order Richard to withdraw from Toulouse, where he had been sent with an army to apply new pressure on Philip's uncle, Raymond.<ref name=Warren2000PP610>Warren (2000), pp.610, 614.</ref> Philip threatened to invade Normandy if this did not happen.<ref name=Warren2000PP610/> Philip also reopened the question of the Vexin which had formed part of Margaret's dowry several years before; Henry still occupied the region and now Philip insisted that the king either complete the long agreed Richard-Alice marriage, or return Margaret's dowry.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.611<U+2013>612.</ref> Philip invaded the Berry and Henry mobilised a large army which confronted the French at [[Ch<U+00E2>teauroux]], before papal intervention brought a truce.<ref>Warren (2000), p.616.</ref> During the negotiations, however, Philip suggested to Richard that he should ally with the French king against Henry, marking the start of a new strategy to divide the father and son.<ref>Warren (2000), p.616; Hallam and Everard, p.166.</ref>

Philip's offer coincided with a crisis in the Levant. In 1187 [[Jerusalem]] surrendered to [[Saladin]] and calls for a new crusade swept Europe.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.604<U+2013>607.</ref> Richard was enthusiastic and announced his intention to join the crusade, and Henry and Philip Augustus announced their similar intent at the start of 1188.<ref name=Warren2000P602/> Taxes began to be raised and plans made for supplies and transport.<ref name=Warren2000P602/> Richard was keen to start his crusade, but was forced to wait for Henry to make his arrangements.<ref name=Warren2000P618>Warren (2000), p.618.</ref> In the meantime, Richard set about crushing some of his enemies in Aquitaine in 1188, before once again attacking the Count of Toulouse.<ref name=Warren2000P618/> Richard's campaign undermined the truce between Henry and Philip and both sides again mobilised large forces in anticipation of war.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.619<U+2013>620.</ref> This time Henry rejected Philip's offers of a short-term truce in the hope of convincing the French king to agree a long-term peace deal, but Philip refused to consider Henry's proposals.<ref name=Warren2000P620>Warren (2000), p.620.</ref> To Richard, however, Henry appeared to be stalling for time and delaying the departure of their crusade: Richard was furious.<ref name=Warren2000P620/>

===Death===
[[File:Henry II Final Campaign.png|thumb|250px|Henry's final campaign in 1189]]
The relationship between Henry and Richard finally dissolved into violence shortly before Henry's death. Philip held a peace conference in November 1188, making a public offer of a generous long-term peace settlement with Henry, conceding to his various territorial demands, if Henry would finally marry Richard and Alice and announce Richard as his recognised heir.<ref name=Warren2000P621>Warren (2000), p.621.</ref> Henry refused the proposal, whereupon Richard himself spoke up, demanding to be recognised as Henry's successor.<ref name=Warren2000P621/> Henry remained silent and Richard then publicly changed sides at the conference and gave formal homage to Philip in front of the assembled nobles.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.621<U+2013>622.</ref> 

The papacy intervened once again to try to produce a last-minute peace deal, resulting in a fresh conference at [[La Fert<U+00E9>-Bernard]] in 1189.<ref name=Warren2000P622>Warren (2000), p.622.</ref> By now Henry was suffering from a [[Upper gastrointestinal bleeding|bleeding]] [[Peptic ulcer|ulcer]] that would ultimately prove fatal.<ref>Warren (2000), p.625; Carpenter, p.244.</ref> The discussions achieved little, although Henry is alleged to have offered Philip that John could marry Alice instead of Richard, reflecting the rumours circulating over the summer that Henry was considering openly disinheriting Richard.<ref name=Warren2000P622/> The conference broke up with war appearing likely, but Philip and Richard launched a surprise attack immediately afterwards during what was conventionally a period of truce.<ref>Warren (2000), p.623.</ref> 

Henry was caught by surprise at Le Mans but made a forced march north to [[Alen<U+00E7>on]], from where he could escape into the safety of Normandy.<ref>Warren (2000), pp.623<U+2013>624.</ref> Suddenly, however, Henry turned back south towards Anjou, against the advice of his officials.<ref name=Warren2000P625>Warren (2000), p.625.</ref> The weather was extremely hot, the king was increasingly ill and Henry appears to have wanted to die peacefully in Anjou rather than fight yet another campaign.<ref name=Warren2000P625/> Henry evaded the enemy forces on his way south and collapsed in his [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Chinon|castle]] at [[Chinon]].<ref>Warren (2000), p.624.</ref> Philip and Richard were making good progress, not least because it was now obvious that Henry was dying and that Richard would be the next king, and the pair offered negotiations with Henry.<ref name=Warren2000P625/> They met at Ballan, where Henry, only just able to remain seated on his horse, agreed to a complete surrender: he would do homage to Philip; he would give up Alice to a guardian and she would marry Richard at the end of the coming crusade; he would recognise Richard as his heir; he would pay Philip compensation, and key castles would be given to Philip as a guarantee.<ref name=Warren2000P625/> 

Henry was carried back to Chinon on a [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]], where he was informed that John had publicly sided with Richard in the conflict.<ref name=Warren2000P626>Warren (2000), p.626.</ref> This desertion proved the final shock and he finally collapsed into a fever, only coming to for a few brief moments in which he gave confession.<ref name=Warren2000P626/> Henry died on 6 July 1189, aged 56; the king had wished to be interred at [[Grandmontines|Grandmont Abbey]] in the [[Limousin (region)|Limousin]], but the hot weather made transporting his body impractical and he was instead buried at the nearby [[Fontevraud Abbey]].<ref name=Warren2000P626/>

==Legacy==
[[File:Henry-eleanor-tomb.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Henry and Eleanor in [[Fontevraud Abbey]]]]
In the immediate aftermath of Henry's death, Richard successfully claimed his father's lands; he later left on the [[Third Crusade]], but never married Alice as he had agreed with Philip Augustus. Eleanor was released from house arrest and regained control of Aquitaine, where she ruled on Richard's behalf.<ref>Martindale (1999), pp.141<U+2013>142.</ref> Henry's empire, however, did not survive long and collapsed during the reign of his youngest son John, when Philip captured all of the Angevin possessions in France except [[Gascony]]. This collapse had various causes, including long-term changes in economic power, growing cultural differences between England and Normandy but, in particular, the fragile, familial nature of Henry's empire.<ref>Gillingham (1984), p.31; Peltzer, p.1203.</ref>

Henry was not a popular king and few expressed much grief on news of his death.<ref>Strickland, p.187.</ref> Writing in the 1190s, William of Newburgh commented that "in his own time he was hated by almost everyone"; he was widely criticised by his own contemporaries, even within his own court.<ref>White (2000), p.213; Vincent (2007b), p.330.</ref> Many of the changes Henry introduced during his long rule, however, had major long-term consequences. Henry's legal changes are generally considered to have laid down the basis for the [[English Common Law]], with the Exchequer court a forerunner of the later [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Common Bench]] at Westminster.<ref>Brand, p.216.</ref> Henry's itinerant justices also influenced his contemporaries' legal reforms: Philip Augustus' creation of itinerant ''bailli'', for example, clearly drew on the Henrician model.<ref>Hallam and Everard, p.211.</ref> Henry's intervention in Brittany, Wales and Scotland also had a significant long-term impact on the development of their societies and governmental systems.<ref>Davies, pp.22<U+2013>23.</ref>

===Historiography===
Henry and his reign have attracted historians for many years.<ref>Vincent (2007a), p.2.</ref> In the 18th century the historian [[David Hume]] argued that Henry's reign was pivotal to creating a genuinely English monarchy and, ultimately, a unified Britain.<ref>Vincent (2007a), p.2; Hume (1761).</ref> Henry's role in the Becket controversy was considered relatively praiseworthy by [[Protestant]] historians of the period, while his disputes with the French king Louis also attracted positive patriotic comment.<ref>Vincent (2007a), p.3.</ref> In the Victorian period there was a fresh interest in the personal morality of historical figures and scholars began to express greater concern over aspects of Henry's behaviour, including his role as a parent and husband.<ref>Vincent (2007a), pp.5<U+2013>7.</ref> The king's role in the death of Becket attracted particular criticism.<ref>Vincent (2007a), p.9.</ref> Late-Victorian historians, with increasing access to the documentary records from the period, stressed Henry's contribution to the evolution of key English institutions, including the development of the law and the exchequer.<ref>Vincent (2007a), p.10.</ref> [[William Stubbs]]' analysis led him to label Henry as a "legislator king", responsible for major, long-lasting reforms in England.<ref>Vincent (2007a), p.10; White (2000), p.3; Stubbs (1874).</ref> Influenced by the contemporary growth of the [[British empire]], historians such as [[Kate Norgate]] undertook detailed research into Henry's continental possessions, creating the term "the Angevin Empire" in the 1880s.<ref>Aurell, p.15; Vincent (2007a), p.16.</ref>

Twentieth century historians challenged many of these conclusions. In the 1950s Jacques Boussard and [[John Jolliffe]], amongst others, focused on the nature of Henry's "empire"; French scholars in particular analysed the mechanics of how royal power functioned during this period.<ref>Aurell, p.19.</ref> The Anglocentric aspects of many histories of Henry were challenged from the 1980s onwards, with efforts made to bring together British and French historical analysis of the period.<ref>Vincent (2007a), p.21.</ref> More detailed study of the written records left by Henry has problematised some earlier interpretations: Robert Eyton's ground-breaking 1878 work tracing Henry's itinerary through deductions from the [[pipe roll]]s, for example, has been critiqued as being too certain a way of determining location or court attendance.<ref>Vincent (2007b), pp.279<U+2013>281; Bates (1998), pp.89<U+2013>102, cited Vincent (2007b), p.287; Eyton (1878).</ref> Although many more of Henry's [[royal charter]]s have been identified, the task of interpreting these records, the financial information in the pipe rolls and wider economic data from the reign is understood to be more challenging than once thought.<ref>Vincent (2007b), p.286, 299; Barratt pp.248<U+2013>294.</ref> Significant gaps in historical analysis of Henry remain, especially the nature of his rule in Anjou and the south of France.<ref>Vincent (2007a), p.22.</ref>

===Popular culture===
Henry II appears in a number of modern plays and films. The king forms a central character in [[James Goldman]]'s 1966 play ''[[The Lion in Winter]]'', set in 1183 and presenting an imaginary encounter between Henry's immediate family and Philip Augustus over Christmas at Chinon. The 1968 film adaptation communicates the modern popular view of Henry as a somewhat sacrilegious, fiery and determined king, although, as Goldman observes, Henry's passions and character are essentially fictional.<ref>Martinson, p.263; Palmer, p.46.</ref> ''The Lion in Winter'' has proved an enduring representation of Henry, being [[The Lion in Winter (2003 film)|remade in 2003]] for television. Henry also appears in the play ''[[Becket]]'' by [[Jean Anouilh]], [[Becket (1964 film)|filmed]] in 1964; once again, however, the character of the king is deliberately fictitious, driven by the need for drama between Henry and Becket in the play.<ref>Anouilh, p.xxiv.</ref> The Becket controversy also forms the basis for [[T. S. Elliot]]'s play ''[[Murder in the Cathedral]]'', where the tensions between Henry and Becket form the basis both for a discussion of the more superficial events of Becket's death, and Elliot's deeper religious interpretation of the episode.<ref>Tiwawi and Tiwawi, p.90.</ref>
