'''Maynard James Keenan''' (born '''James Herbert Keenan''' on April 17, 1964)<ref name=McAlley-86/> is an American [[rock music|rock]] singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, winemaker, and actor. Originally from [[Ohio]], Keenan spent his high school and college years in [[Michigan]]. After serving in the [[United States Army|Army]] in the early 1980s, he attended [[Kendall College of Art and Design]] in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]]. He moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]] in 1988 to pursue a career in interior design and set construction. He formed the band [[Tool (band)|Tool]] with [[Adam Jones (musician)|Adam Jones]] shortly thereafter.

Keenan is best known as the lead singer of the [[Music recording sales certification|multi-platinum]] rock bands Tool and [[A Perfect Circle]] with whom he has released four<!-- Opiate is not a studio album, it's an EP. No, it's an album, not a LP. --> and three [[studio album]]s, respectively. In 2003 he created [[Puscifer]] as a side project, financing and releasing its first studio album in October 2007. Since rising to fame, Keenan has been a noted recluse, although he does emerge to support charitable causes.

In addition to his music career, he has performed improvisational stand-up comedy and ventured into acting. He is the current owner of Merkin Vineyards and the associated winery, [[Caduceus Cellars]], and has part ownership of Stronghold Vineyards, all located in [[Arizona]], where he lives. Among other business ventures, he is a partner in the Los Angeles restaurant Cobras & Matadors, and owns a [[Farmers' market|produce market]] and an [[Organic food|organic]] market in [[Cornville, Arizona]], the latter featuring a tasting room for his wines as well as a food court.

==Early life==

James Keenan was born in [[Ravenna, Ohio|Ravenna]], Ohio, on April 17, 1964, the only child of Judith Marie and Michael Loren Keenan. When his parents divorced in 1968, his father, a high school teacher, moved to [[Michigan]] and Keenan would only see him about once a year for the next 12 years. His mother remarried, bringing Keenan into an "intolerant and unworldly household", where his intelligence and creative expression would be stifled.<ref name=McAlley-86>McAlley, p. 86.</ref> When Keenan was 11, his mother suffered a paralyzing [[cerebral aneurysm]], which would later serve as the inspiration for many of his creative works.<ref name=McAlley-88>McAlley, p. 88.</ref> A few years later, she persuaded Keenan to live with his father in Michigan. Keenan considers this "the best move [he] ever made."<ref name=McAlley-86/>

Inspired by [[Bill Murray]]'s performance in the 1981 comedy film ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'', Keenan joined the [[United States Army]], with the intention of having the [[G.I. Bill]] fund his dream of attending [[art school]].<ref name=McAlley-86/> By this point, he had lived in Ohio, Michigan, [[New Jersey]], [[New York]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Kansas]], and [[Texas]].<ref name="TSDNbio">{{cite web

==Music career==
===Tool===
{{Main|Tool (band)}}
After moving to Los Angeles, Keenan met [[Adam Jones]] who had heard him singing on a [[Demo (music)|demo]] in college. Impressed with Keenan's vocals, Jones suggested that they form a band. Although reluctant at first,<ref name="AV"/> Keenan agreed and, in 1990, Tool was formed. Fronted by Keenan, the eventual lineup included [[guitarist]] Jones; his neighbor, [[drummer]] [[Danny Carey]]; and [[bassist]] [[Paul D'Amour]], who would later be replaced by [[Justin Chancellor]].<ref name="circusmagazine">{{Cite news

Tool signed to [[Zoo Entertainment]] in November 1991 and released the ''[[Opiate (EP)|Opiate]]'' EP the following year. To support this release, the band toured with [[Fishbone]] and [[Rage Against the Machine]]. During a 1993 show at the [[Church of Scientology]]<U+2019>s [[Celebrity Centre]] in Los Angeles, Keenan (who would later write the lyrics "Fuck [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and fuck all his clones" in "[[<U+00C6>nema]]") bleated like a sheep for a good portion of the show. "Before our set this guy tries to intimidate me by showing me a gun in his jacket," Keenan recalled. "I explained to him that if he pissed me off I<U+2019>d start a riot."<ref name=Blender/>

Shortly thereafter, Tool released their 1993 debut album, ''[[Undertow (Tool album)|Undertow]]'', in the United States. It was certified gold after just eight months, and platinum less than a year later.<ref name=GPC>{{cite web

The album was certified gold in ten weeks, achieved double platinum in ten months,<ref name=GPC/> and won the [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]] in 1998.<ref name=Grammy/> After the release of the album, Tool began a prolonged legal battle with their label, [[Volcano Records]] (formerly Zoo Records), over contract violations.

During the hiatus, the band members were outspokenly critical of [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] networks, due to the negative financial impact on artists dependent on success in record sales. During an interview with ''[[NY Rock]]'' in 2000, Keenan stated, "I think there are a lot of other industries out there that might deserve being destroyed.

The [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] they formed, A Perfect Circle, began performing in 1999 and released its first album ''[[Mer de Noms]]'' in 2000. They released a successful follow-up in 2003 titled ''[[Thirteenth Step]]'', a reference to [[twelve-step program]]s (many of the songs were written from the perspective of recovery).<ref name=legend/> Both albums were eventually certified platinum. Their subsequent 2004 album, ''[[Emotive (album)|Emotive]]'', was primarily composed of covers, except for the singles "[[Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums]]"<U+2014>a song inspired by "Pet" that was originally released on ''Thirteenth Step''<U+2014>and "Passive". Keenan later characterized the record as a political album with which he "tested the waters" and was subsequently "crucified" for it because of the content.<ref name=AV/> It was certified gold the month after its release. That same year they released the DVD and CD set entitled ''[[Amotion]]'', which was certified platinum within a month of its release.

Despite its success, the future of A Perfect Circle remains uncertain. It is currently on hiatus, partly due to Keenan's commitments to Tool; Howerdel reported in a May 2006 interview with MTV that the supergroup's work was concluded for the time being.<ref>{{cite web

It's tough for a guy who went from being a guitar tech [for Tool] to being in a band with a pretentious, famous singer and having to live in that shadow.

In 2003, Keenan surfaced under the name "Puscifer" for the song "REV 22:20" on the ''[[Underworld (soundtrack)|Underworld]]'' film soundtrack. Puscifer was once advertised as a side project with [[Danny Lohner]], who had formerly performed live with [[Nine Inch Nails]], but has since been formed as a manifestation of Keenan's "creative subconscious"<ref>{{cite web

A primary purpose of Keenan's lyrics for Tool involves a desire to connect with the listeners on a personal level; to encourage them to look within themselves for self-identity, understanding and reflection.<ref name="diCarlo"/> Tool does not include lyrics with any releases as Keenan believes most people "don't get it" and it is not a priority of the band that people do.<ref name="livewire">{{cite journal

In the mid-90s, responding to requests for Tool to perform in benefit shows, Keenan created "Free [[Frances Bean]]" tee-shirts to represent his own platform. Frances' mother, [[Courtney Love]], had previously referred to Keenan as a "media whore" to which he responded, "Isn't that great? I have the distinction of being called a media whore by Courtney Love."<ref name=legend/> He said that after watching "the tornado that is her mother", he thought "Oh my God, how is Frances Bean gonna survive this insanity?"<ref name=legend/> Although it was started as a simple joke, the tee-shirts were soon in high demand and Keenan was giving them away.<ref name=legend/>
