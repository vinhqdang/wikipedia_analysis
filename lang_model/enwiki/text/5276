'''Jay Pritzker Pavilion''', '''Pritzker Pavilion''', or '''Pritzker Music Pavilion''' is a [[band shell]] in the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] of [[Chicago]] in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]]. The [[Frank Gehry]]-designed pavilion, named for [[Pritzker family]] member [[Jay Pritzker]], was constructed between June 1999 and July 2004 in [[Millennium Park]].<ref name=MPF&F/> It is located on the south side of [[Randolph Street (Chicago)|Randolph Street]] directly across from some of the [[List of tallest buildings in the world|tallest buildings in the world]] and east of the [[Chicago Landmark]] [[Historic Michigan Boulevard District]].

It is the park's outdoor performing arts venue and the new home of the [[Grant Park Symphony Orchestra and Chorus]]. As home of the Grant Park Symphony Orchestra and Chorus it is also the home of the [[Grant Park Music Festival]], the nation's only remaining free outdoor [[classical music]] series. The structure is built partially atop the [[Harris Theater (Chicago)|Harris Theater for Music and Dance]], the park's indoor performing arts venue.<ref name=PBKT>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbase.com/tanakak/pritzker|title=The Jay Pritzker Pavilion|accessdate=2007-09-20|publisher=Pbase.com and Kenneth Tanaka}}</ref> It serves as the centerpiece for the park that was opened on [[July 16]] [[2004]].<ref name=JPMPSaGaiL>{{cite web|url=http://www.lares-lexicon.com/millenium/millenium.html|accessdate=2007-09-20|title=The Jay Pritzker Music Pavilion Sounds as Good as it Looks|author=Delacoma, Wayne}}</ref>

The performance venue is designed with a large fixed seating area, a great lawn, a [[trellis]] network to support the [[sound system]] and a signature Gehry [[stainless steel]] [[headdress]]. It features a sound system with an innovative acoustic design that replicates an indoor [[concert hall]] sound experience.

The development follows a series of open-air projects by [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]] designer, Frank Gehry, such as the [[Merriweather Post Pavilion]] in [[Columbia, Maryland]], the [[Concord Performing Arts Center]] in [[Concord, California]], and numerous renovations to the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood, California]]. The structure is also a part of a larger inner city redevelopment that includes a theater, extensive gardens and a Gehry-designed serpentine pedestrian [[footbridge]] that buffers against street noise.<ref name=gug/> The redevelopment was part of an effort to overcome unsightly [[railroad track]]s and [[parking lot]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/environment/millennium_park.html|accessdate=2007-09-20|publisher=citymayors.com|author=Pesci, Renato|title=A people's park of international importance in downtown Chicago}}</ref> Much like his [[Experience Music Project]] in [[Seattle, Washington]], it suggests musical qualities. The trellis design was an effort to avoid the traditional obstructing forest of speaker towers.<ref name=gug>{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/exhibitions/past_exhibitions/gehry/millenium_30.html|accessdate=2007-09-20|title=Millennium Park Music Pavilion and Great Lawn|publisher=guggenheim.org}}</ref>

The original design was much more modest. It had a smaller shell structure and speakers affixed to poles interspersed throughout the seating area. However, two things happened to change the original plans. [[John H. Bryan]], former [[CEO]] of the [[Sara Lee Corporation]], raised revenues to change the scope of the project. Also, Jay Pritzker's widow was unimpressed with the design and demanded that Gehry be involved.<ref name=JPMPSaGaiL/> Despite the redesign, the pavilion has its blemishes: the supporting backside along Randolph Street is a bit controversial, and the fact that the supporting proscenium braces are left exposed bothers some observers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lynnbecker.com/repeat/Gehry/gehrybaroque.htm|accessdate=2007-09-21|title=Frank Gehry, Millennium Park and the development of the Techno-Baroque|author=Becker, Lynn|publisher=Lynn Becker |work=Repeat}}</ref>

===Acoustics===
[[Image:20070919 Pritzker Pavilion bandshell.JPG|thumb|180px|right|The pavilion [[band shell]] is designed to reflect sound for optimal acoustics.]]
[[Image:20070919 Pritzker Pavilion speakers.JPG|thumb|100px|right|Speakers close up]]
Pritzker uses an innovative [[LARES]] sound system that generates reflected and reverberant energy that surrounds the audience. The system causes the sound quality to be fairly uniform throughout the entire venue. The system has received critical acclaim for adaptations of its technologies such as signal processing in a variety of indoor and outdoor venues.<ref name=JPMPSaGaiL/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mixfoundation.org/tec/1993.html|title=1993 TEC Awards|publisher=mixfoundation.org}}</ref> The Pritzker Pavilion is the first permanent outdoor installation of the LARES system in the United States. The trellis serves acoustic and architectural purposes because it allows for the precise placement for sound optimization without visual obstructions, and it simultaneously provides a unifying visual canopy.<ref name=JPMPSaGaiL/>  

The overall acoustic system is described as a distributed sound reinforcement system. It uses many innovative features as well as standard sound reinforcement techniques:<ref name=JPP,MP>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/strategies/noise/docs/urbandes/16pritzkerpavillion.pdf|accessdate=2007-09-21|title=Jay Pritzker Pavilion, Millennium Park|publisher=Talaske|work=london.gov.uk}}</ref><ref name=JPMPSaGaiL/>
*Musicians on stage are able to hear each other clearly in a way that facilitates ensemble play.
*Direct natural sound from the stage is reflected from architectural surfaces as well as being reinforced by two sound systems.
*Forward facing reinforcement speakers time the relaying of sound so as to make it seem to have arrived directly from the stage with clarity and proper volume levels.
*Distributed speakers allow for lower sound volumes than would be necessary with centralized speakers that would disturb the neighboring residences and business.

Specifically, the trellis system has unique features:<ref name=JPP,MP/><ref name=JPMPSaGaiL/>
*Instead of merely reinforcing the sound like a traditional public address system, it seeks to replicate the acoustics of a concert hall.
**It creates a clearly defined concert space.
**Sound arriving directly from lateral sources masks city disturbances.
**Downward facing acoustic enhancement speakers simulate sound reflection similar to indoor concert hall wall and ceiling effects.
