==History==
[[Image:Schneepflug pferdzug.jpg|thumb|right|An early horse-drawn snowplough at the Rosstag Burggen, a [[historical reenactment]] of life in 19th century [[Germany]].<ref name="Rosstag">{{cite web|url=http://www.rosstag-burggen.de/|title=Ein Fest f<U+00FC>r Pferdefreunde|publisher=Rosstag Burggen|language=German|accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref>]]
Although snow removal dates back to at least the [[Middle Ages]], early attempts merely involved using a [[shovel]] or broom to remove snow from walkways and roads.<ref name="shovel"/> Before motorised transport, snow removal was seen as less of a concern; unpaved roads in rural areas were dangerous and bumpy, and snow and ice made the surface far smoother. Most farmers could simply replace their wagons with [[sled]]s, allowing the transport of heavy materials such as timber with relative ease.<ref name="ala"/> Early communities in the northern regions of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] even used [[Animal-powered transport|animal-drawn]] snow rollers, the earliest winter service vehicles, to compress the snow covering roads. The compression increased the life of the snow and eased passage for sleds. Some communities even employed snow wardens to spread or "pave" snow onto exposed areas such as bridges, to allow sleds to use these routes.<ref name="ala"/>

However, with the increase in [[Pavement (material)|paved roads]] and the increasing size of cities, snow-paving fell out of favour, as the resultant slippery surfaces posed a danger to pedestrians and traffic. The earliest [[patent]]s for snowploughs date back to 1840, but there are no records of their actual use until 1862, when the city of [[Milwaukee]] began operating horse-drawn carts fitted with [[snowplough]]s.<ref name="shovel"/> The horse-drawn snowplough quickly spread to other cities, especially those in areas prone to heavy snowfall.

[[Image:Unimog mit Schneefr<U+00E4>se um 1955.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Unimog]] snow blower from 1955.]]
The first motorised snowploughs were developed in 1913, based on truck and [[tractor]] bodies. These machines allowed the mechanisation of the snow clearing process, reducing the labour required for snow removal and increasing the speed and efficiency of the process.<ref name="shovel"/> The expansion of the [[aviation]] industry also acted as a catalyst for the development of winter service vehicles during the early 20th century. Even a light dusting of snow or ice could cause an aeroplane to crash, so airports erected large fences around airfields to prevent [[snowdrift]]s, and began to maintain fleets of vehicles to clear runways in heavy weather.<ref name="shovel"/>

With the popularisation of the [[motor car]], it was found that ploughing alone was insufficient for removing all snow and ice from the roadway, leading to the development of [[Winter service vehicle#Gritter|gritting vehicles]], which used [[sodium chloride]] to accelerate the melting of the snow.<ref name="shovel"/> Early attempts at gritting were resisted, as the salt used encouraged rusting, causing damage to the metal structures of bridges and the shoes of pedestrians. However, as the number of [[car crash|motoring accidents]] increased, the protests subsided and by the end of the 1920s, many cities in the United States used salt and sand to clear the roads and increase road safety.<ref name="shovel"/> As [[environmentalism|environmental awareness]] increased through the 1960s and 1970s, gritting once again came under criticism due to its environmental impact, leading to the development of alternative de-icing chemicals and more efficient spreading systems.<ref name="shovel"/>

Winter service vehicles are usually based on dump truck [[chassis]], which are then converted into winter service vehicles either by the manufacturer or an [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] third-party. A typical modification involves the replacement of [[steel]] components of the vehicle with corrosion resistant [[aluminium]] or [[fibreglass]], waterproofing any exposed [[Electronics|electronic]] components, replacement of the stock hopper with a specially designed gritting body, the addition of a plough frame, reinforcement of the [[wheels]], [[Bumper (automobile)|bumpers]] to support the heavy blade, and the addition of extra [[headlamp]]s, a [[light bar]], and [[retroreflector]]s for visibility.<ref name="Schofield">{{cite web|url=http://www.shofieldsscrapmetal.co.uk/gritting_contractors/history_of_gritting/|title=Gritting Contractors : History Of Gritting|publisher=Schofield of Huddersfield|accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref> Other common changes include the replacement of the stock tires with [[rain tire]]s or mud and snow tires and the shortening of the vehicle's [[wheelbase]] to improve maneuverability.<ref name="Scho2">{{cite web|url=http://www.shofieldsscrapmetal.co.uk/gritting_contractors/vehicles/|title=Gritting Contractors : Vehicles|publisher=Schofield of Huddersfield|accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref> However, some winter service vehicles, especially those designed for use on footpaths or [[car-free zone|pedestrianised zones]], are built on a far smaller chassis.

In most countries, winter service vehicles usually have amber light bars, which are activated to indicate that the vehicle is operating below the local [[speed limit]] or otherwise poses a danger to other traffic, either by straddling lanes<ref name="Schofield"/> or by spreading grit or de-icer.<ref name="highways"/> In some areas, such as the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Ontario]], winter service vehicles use the blue flashing lights associated with [[emergency service vehicle]]s, rather than the amber or orange used elsewhere.<ref name="HTAO">{{cite web|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/DBLaws/Statutes/English/90h08_e.htm#62.(31)|title=Ontario Highway Traffic Act R.S.O. 1990, CHAPTER H.8 section 62-31|publisher=[[Politics of Ontario|Government of Ontario]] e-Laws website|accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref> Many agencies also paint their vehicles in high-contrast orange or yellow to allow the vehicles to been seen more clearly in [[whiteout (weather)|whiteout]] conditions.

==Operation==

Winter service vehicles are operated by both government agencies and by private [[subcontractor]]s.<ref name="Europe"/> [[Public works]] in areas which regularly receive snowfall usually maintain a fleet of their own vehicles or pay [[retainer]]s to contractors for priority access to vehicles in winter, while cities where snow is a less regular occurrence may simply hire the vehicles as needed.<ref name="edmonton">{{cite news|url= http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=dc3a800b-634c-4a62-aa6c-1eb7dd5747ed&k=69943 |title=City may ante up to ensure snow plowing|publisher=[[Edmonton Journal]]|date=[[April 14]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref> Winter service vehicles in the [[United Kingdom]] are the only road-going vehicles entitled to use [[red diesel]].

[[Image:Stra<U+00DF>enmeisterei Salzlager.jpg|thumb|left|A [[brine]] tank at a service depot in [[Germany]].]]
Winter service vehicle drivers usually work [[part time]], before and during inclement weather only, with drivers working a 12 to 16 hour shift.<ref name="Go"/><ref name="magazine"/> Main roads are typically gritted in advance, to reduce the disruption to the network.<ref name="magazine"/> Salt barns are provided at regular intervals for drivers to collect more grit, and bedding is provided at [[road maintenance depot]]s for drivers to use between shifts in heavy or prolonged storms.<ref name="magazine"/>

Weather conditions typically vary greatly depending on altitude; hot countries can experience heavy snowfall in mountainous regions yet receive very little in low-lying areas, increasing the accident rate among drivers inexperienced in winter driving. In addition, road surface temperatures can fall rapidly at higher altitudes, precipitating rapid [[frost]] formation. As a result, gritting and ploughing runs are often prioritised in favour of clearing these mountain roads, especially at the start and end of the snow season.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/circulars/ec063.pdf|pages=pp. 414<U+2013>421|format=[[PDF]]|title=Sixth International Symposium on Snow Removal and Ice Control|accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref> The hazardous roads through mountain passes pose additional problems for the large winter service vehicles. The heavy metal frame and bulky grit makes hill climbing demanding for the vehicle, so vehicles have extremely high torque [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] systems to provide enough power to make the climb.<ref name="Schofield"/> Furthermore, because the tight [[hairpin turn]]s found on mountain slopes are difficult for long vehicles to navigate, winter service vehicles for use in mountainous areas are shortened, usually from six wheels to four.<ref name="Scho2"/>

==Equipment==
===De-icer===
{{main|De-icing}}
[[Image:Aircraft Deicing Syracuse.jpg|thumb|A de-icing vehicle treating an [[American Airlines]] [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80/MD-90|MD-80]] at [[Syracuse Hancock International Airport]], [[New York]]]]

De-icers spray heated [[de-icing fluid]], often [[propylene glycol]] or [[ethylene glycol]], onto icy surfaces such as the bodies of aircraft and road surfaces.<ref name="Dresden2">{{cite web|url= http://www.dresden-airport.de/en/struktur/presse/pressemitteilungen/pmDetail.html?id=385|title=Winter service team at Dresden Airport ready for the cold season|publisher=[[Dresden Airport]]|date=[[29 October]] [[2004]]|accessdate=2007-02-09}}</ref> These prevent ice from forming on the body of the aircraft while on the ground. Ice makes the surface of the wings rougher, reducing the amount of [[Lift (force)|lift]] they provide while increasing [[Drag (physics)|drag]]. The ice also increases the weight of the aircraft and can affect its balance.

Aircraft de-icing vehicles usually consist of a large [[tanker truck]], containing the concentrated de-icing fluid, with a water feed to dilute the fluid according to the ambient temperature. The vehicle also normally has a [[cherry picker]] crane, allowing the operator to spray the entire aircraft in as little time as possible; an entire [[Boeing 737]] can be treated in under 10 minutes by a single de-icing vehicle.<ref name="Dresden2"/>

Some road contractors also choose to use de-icers as an alternative to gritters; the vehicle carries a tank of [[brine]], which is sprayed on the road surface. Brine acts faster than solid salt and does not require compression by passing traffic to become effective. The brine is also more environmentally friendly, as less salt is required to treat the same length of road.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thedeicingbusiness.com/images/news/Articles/0510-ggbb.jpg|title=Gritty Gritty Bang Bang!|last=Kengt|first=Ann-Marie|publisher=Local Authority Plants and Vehicles Magazine|date=October 2005}}</ref> Airport runways are also de-iced by sprayers fitted with long spraying arms. These arms are wide enough to cross the entire runway, and allow de-icing of the entire airstrip to take place in a single pass, reducing the length of time that the runway is unavailable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schmidt-automotive.com/holding/english/products/airport/airside/ice/sprayers/sprayers-nozzle.php| title=Airside nozzle sprayers|publisher=Schmidt Automotive|accessdate=2007-02-10}}</ref>

===Gritter/Sander===
[[Image:Schneepflug Strasse hinten.jpg|thumb|left|The hopper and [[impeller]] of a gritter in [[Germany]]]]

A gritter, also known as a sander,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=34540&dict=CALD|title=Cambridge Dictionary definition: Gritter|publisher=''[[Cambridge University Press]]''|accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref> salt spreader or salt truck,<ref name="highways"/> is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously.<ref name="magazine"/> Gritters are used to spread grit, a mixture of [[sand]] and [[halite|rock salt]], onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the top to prevent foreign objects from entering the spreading mechanism and hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by an [[impeller]], attached by a [[hydraulic drive system]] to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread manually using shovels by men riding on the back of the lorry, and some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be manually loaded into the impeller from the hopper.<ref name="p444">Pearson, p. 444<U+2013>445</ref><ref name="p53"/> Salt reduces the melting point of ice by [[freezing-point depression]], causing it to melt at lower temperatures and run off harmlessly to the edge of the road, while sand increases traction by increasing [[friction]] between car [[tire]]s and roadways. The amount of salt dropped varies with the condition of the road; to prevent the formation of light ice, approximately 10&nbsp;[[gram]]s per [[square metre]] (0.3&nbsp;[[ounce|oz]]/[[square yard|yd<U+00B2>]]) is dropped, while thick snow can require up to 40&nbsp;g/m<U+00B2> (1.2&nbsp;oz/yd<U+00B2>) of salt, independent of the volume of sand dropped.<ref>Institution of Civil Engineers, p. 27</ref> The grit is sometimes mixed with [[molasses]] to help adhesion to the road surface. However, the sweet molasses often attracts livestock, who lick the road.<ref name="sheep">{{cite news|url=http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_2181287.html|title=New road grit popular - with sheep|publisher=[[Ananova]]|accessdate=2007-02-09}}</ref> The grit is sometimes heated as it is passed out of the nozzle; this helps melt the ice and improves the [[solubility]] of the salt. Quieter rural roads may be considered too minor to grit, so [[grit bin]]s are often provided, containing a mixture of sand and salt for drivers and pedestrians to shovel onto the road themselves. Different types of grit substrate can cause problems for some gritting machines with 'blocking' where sand/grit or salt is damp and clumps together, in these cases an augur or some form of vibrator has to be employed to enable continuous flow of substrate<ref>see www.snowex.com</ref>.

Gritters are among the winter service vehicles also used in airports, to keep runways free of ice. However, the salt normally used to clear roads can damage the [[airframe]] of aircraft and interferes with the sensitive navigation equipment. As a result, airport gritters spread less dangerous [[potassium acetate]] onto the runways instead, as potassium acetate does not corrode the aircraft or the airside equipment.<ref name="Dresden2"/>

====Materials====

Gritters cannot use sea-salt, as it is too fine and dissolves too quickly,<ref>[[British Standard|BS]] 3247:1991, [[BSI Group|British Standards Institution]].</ref> so all salt used in gritting comes from salt mines, a [[renewable|non-renewable]] source. Additionally, high concentrations of salt in soil kill plants, so it is in the interest of operators to limit gritting to an absolute minimum. As a result, road maintenance agencies have advanced networks of ice prediction stations, to prevent unnecessary gritting which not only wastes salt, but can damage the environment and disrupt traffic.<ref name="GNN">{{cite news|url=http://www.gnn.gov.uk/content/detail.asp?NewsAreaID=2&ReleaseID=138214|title=New facilities help guard against winter|publisher=[[Government News Network]]|date=[[3 December]] [[2004]]|accessdate=2007-02-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warrington.gov.uk/traffic/gritting.asp|title=Winter Highway Gritting|publisher=[[Warrington Borough Council]]|accessdate=2007-02-08}}</ref> The salt dropped is eventually washed away and lost, so it cannot be reused or collected after gritting runs, although the insoluble sand can be collected and recycled by [[Street sweeper|street sweeping vehicles]] and mixed with new salt crystals to be reused in later batches of grit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.estesnet.com/PublicWorks/Streets/|title=Street Department|publisher=[[Estes Park, Colorado|Town of Estes Park]]|accessdate=2007-04-19}}</ref> As a result, operators must regularly purchase large quantities of rock salt, depleting a finite resource and damaging the environment through dangerous and polluting [[salt mining]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/NR/exeres/D7AE7E88-6627-4495-B326-EBCEE505406E,frameless.htm?wbc_purpose=Basic&WBCMODE=PresentationUnpublished%23%23%23%23?PageVersion=PRINTERFRIENDLY| title=Minerals Local Plan - Chapter 9|publisher=[[Cheshire County Council]]|accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref>

In some areas of the world, including [[Berlin]], dropping salt is prohibited altogether, except on the highest-risk roads; plain sand, without any melting agents, is spread instead. Although this protects the environment, it is more labour-intensive, as more gritting runs are needed; and as the sand is insoluble, it tends to accumulate at the sides of the road, making it more difficult for [[bus]]es to pull in at [[bus stop]]s.<ref name="HM">{{cite book|title=Highway Meteorology|others=co-edited by Perry, Allen Howard and Symons, Leslie|publisher=Spon Press|isbn=0419156704|origyear=1991|pages=pp. 28}}</ref> Other areas use alternative chemicals which are less harmful to the environment and cause less corrosion damage to metallic structures.

Gritters can also be used in hot weather, when temperatures are high enough to melt the [[bitumen]] used in [[asphalt]].

===Snow blower===
{{main|Snow blower}}
[[Image:Zaugg snowblower 20050315.jpg|thumb|left|A Zaugg snow blower fitted with [[snow chains]]]]

Snow blowers, also known as rotating snowploughs or snow cutters,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schmidt-automotive.com/holding/english/products/winter/snow/clearing.php|title= Attachable snow clearing|publisher=Schmidt Automotive|accessdate=2007-02-10}}</ref> can be used in place of snowploughs on winter service vehicles. A snow blower consists of a rapidly spinning blade which cuts through the snow, forcing it out of a funnel attached to the top of the blower. Snow blowers typically clear much faster than ploughs, with some clearing in excess of 5000&nbsp;[[tonne]]s of snow per hour, and can cut through far deeper snow drifts than a snowplough can.<ref name="Blower">{{cite web|url= http://www.schmidt-automotive.com/holding/english/products/winter/snow/clearing/automotive/cutter-blower/supra-5001.php |title=Supra 5001 specification|publisher=Schmidt Automotive|accessdate=2007-02-10}}</ref> In addition, snow blowers can remove snow from the roadway completely, rather than piling it at the side of the road, making passage easier for other road users and preventing the [[windrow]] from blocking driveways.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plymouthgov.com/DPW/snowplow.htm|title=Snow Plowing Policy|publisher=[[City of Plymouth]] Public Works|accessdate=2007-11-28}}</ref>

===Snow groomer===
{{main|Snow grooming}}
[[Image:Snow grooming working <U+0394>0014.JPG|thumb|An [[Austria]]n snowcat with grooming blade hauling a roller]]

A snow groomer is a machine designed to smooth and compact the snow, rather than removing it altogether. Early snow groomers were used by residents of rural areas to compress the snow close to their homes,<ref name="battleboro">{{cite news|title=Snow Removal Equipment Changes Over Time|publisher=[[Brattleboro Reformer]]|first=Wayne|last=Carhart}}</ref> and consisted of a heavy [[Roller (agricultural tool)|roller]] hauled by [[oxen]] which compacted the snow to make a smooth surface for sledging.<ref name="ala"/> With the invention of the motor car, snow groomers were replaced by snowploughs and snow blowers on public thoroughfares, but remained in use at [[ski resort]]s, where they are used to maintain smooth, safe trails for various wintersports, including [[skiing]], [[snowboarding]] and [[snowmobiling]]. Snow groomers remained unchanged throughout the 20th century, with most consisting of heavy roller which could be attached to a tractor or [[snowcat]] and then hauled across the area to be groomed.<ref name="NewHam">{{cite book|title=Classic New Hampshire: Preserving the Granite State in Changing Times|first=Linda|last=Landry|year=2003|pages=189<U+2013>191|publisher=[[University Press of New England]]|isbn=1584653493}}</ref> 
<!--[[Image:BR180.JPG|thumb|right|A Snowcat off-road winter service vehicle with blade, caterpillar tracks, and snow grooming attachment (blue)]] -->
The development of more advanced electronic systems in the 1980s allowed manufacturers to produce snow groomers which could work on and replicate a much wider range of terrains, with the most modern even able to produce [[half-pipe]]s and [[Mini ramp|ramps]] for snowboarding.<ref name="NewHam"/> Snow groomers are also used in conjunction with [[snow cannon]]s, to ensure that the snow produced is spread evenly across the resort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://travel.howstuffworks.com/snow-maker2.htm|title=How Snow Makers Work|publisher=[[HowStuffWorks]]|first=Tom|last=Harris|accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref> However, snow groomers have a detrimental effect on the environment within the resort. Grooming removes nutrients and minerals from the soil underneath the snow and the regular pressure from the grooming vehicle increases the [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] rate of the soil while decreasing the [[field capacity]]. This increases the rate at which water can soak through the soil, making it more prone to [[erosion]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Nature-Based Tourism, Environment, and Land Management|first=Ralph|last=Buckley|coauthors=Pickering, Catherine; Weaver, David Bruce;|date=2003|publisher=CAB International|isbn=0851997325}}</ref>

===Snow melter===
{{seealso|Metromelt}}
[[Image:Snow melter.jpg|thumb|left|Snow melters working at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]], [[New York]]]]

A snow melting vehicle works by scooping snow into a melting pit located in a large tank at the rear of the vehicle. Around the melting pit is a smaller tank full of boiling water, heated by a powerful burner. The gases from the burner are bubbled through the water, causing some of the water to spill over into the melting pit, melting the snow instantly. The meltwater is discharged into the [[storm drain]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snowmelter.com/principle.html|title=Principle of Operation|publisher=Trecan Combustion|accessdate=2007-02-09}}</ref>

As they have to carry the large water tank and fuel for the burner, snow melting machines tend to be much larger and heavier than most winter service vehicles, at around 18&nbsp;[[metre]]s (59&nbsp;ft), with the largest being hauled by [[semi-trailer truck|semi-trailer]] [[tractor unit]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snowmelter.com/500pd.html|title=500-PD specifications|publisher=Trecan Combustion|accessdate=2007-02-09}}</ref> In addition, the complicated melting process means that snow melting vehicles have a much lower capacity than the equivalent plough or blower vehicle; the largest snow melter can remove 500 tonnes of snow per hour, compared to the 5000 tonnes per hour capacity of any large snow blower.<ref name="Blower"/> However, snow melters are far more environmentally friendly than gritters, as they do not spray hazardous materials, and pollutants from the road surface can be separated from the meltwater and disposed of safely. In addition, as the snow is melted on board, the costs of removing the collected snow from the site is removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snowmelter.com/economics.html|title=Economics of Snow Melting|publisher=Trecan Combustion|accessdate=2007-02-09}}</ref>

===Snowplough===
{{main|Snowplow}}
[[Image:Schneepflug Strasse vorne.jpg|thumb|A [[Germany|German]] snowplough with a hopper for carrying grit]]

Many winter service vehicles can be fitted with snowploughs, to clear roads which are blocked by deep snow. In most cases, the ploughs are mounted on [[hydraulics|hydraulically]]-actuated arms, allowing them to be raised, lowered, and angled to better move snow.  Most winter service vehicles include either permanently fixed ploughs or plough frames: 75% of the UK's [[Highways Agency]] vehicles include a plough frame to which a blade can be attached.<ref name="magazine"/> Winter service vehicles with both a plough frame and a gritting body are known as "all purpose vehicles", and while these are more efficient than using dedicated vehicles, the weight of the hopper often decreases the range of the vehicle. Therefore, most operators will keep at least a few dedicated ploughing vehicles in store for heavy storms.<ref name="p444"/> In the event that specially designed winter service vehicles are not available for ploughing, other service or [[construction vehicle]]s can be used instead: among those used by various authorities are [[grader]]s,<ref name="edmonton"/> [[bulldozer]]s,<ref name="George">{{cite web |url=http://www.city.pg.bc.ca/city_services/transportation/snowoperations/ |title=Transportation Division - Snow Operations |publisher=[[Prince George City Council|City of Prince George]] |accessdate=2007-04-18}}</ref> [[skid loader]]s,<ref name="Wash-Jeff">{{cite web |url=http://www.washjeff.edu/uploadedFiles/Physical_Plant/2005-2006%20W&J%20Snow%20Plan.pdf |title= Washington and Jefferson College snow response plan |format=PDF |publisher=[[Washington and Jefferson College]] |accessdate=2007-04-18}}</ref> and [[rubbish truck]]s.<ref>

Either a snowplough attachment can be mounted on the loader's arm in place of the bucket, or the bucket or snowbasket can be used to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplough or dump truck, which then hauls it away.<ref>{{US patent reference |number=5129169 |y=1992 |m=07  |d=14 |inventor=Aubichon Andre |title=Attachment for snow removal}}</ref> Snowploughs are dangerous to [[overtaking|overtake]]; often, the oncoming lane may not be completely free of snow. In addition, the plough blade causes considerable spray of snow on both sides, which can obscure the vision of other road users.<ref name="highways"/>

===Snow sweeper===
{{seealso|Street sweeper}}
[[Image:Snow sweeper Helsinki.jpg|thumb|left|A snow sweeper in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]]]

A snow sweeper uses brushes to remove thin layers of snow from the pavement surface. Snow sweepers are used after ploughing to remove any remaining material missed by the larger vehicles in areas with very low snow-tolerance, such as airport runways and [[racing track]]s,<ref name="dressweep">{{cite web|url= http://www.dresden-airport.de/en/reisende_und_besucher/willkommen/wie_funktioniert/winterdienst/kehrblasgeraet.html |title=Jet sweeper|publisher=[[Dresden Airport]]|accessdate=2007-07-22}}</ref> as the flexible brushes follow the terrain better than the rigid blades of snowploughs and snow blowers.<ref name="Egholm">{{cite web|url=http://www.egholm.dk/?id=10831|title=Snow Sweeper|publisher=Egholm Maskiner|accessdate=2007-07-22}}</ref> These brushes also allow the vehicle to be used on the tactile tiles found at [[traffic light]]s and [[tram stop]]s, without damaging the delicate surface.<ref name="sidewalk">{{cite web|url=http://wwwcf.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/sidewalk2/sidewalks206.htm|title=Providing Information to Pedestrians|publisher=[[FHWA]]|accessdate=2007-09-25}}</ref> Unlike other winter service vehicles, snow sweepers do not compress the snow, leaving a rough, high friction, surface behind them. This makes snow sweepers the most efficient method of snow removal for snow depths below 10&nbsp;[[centimetres]] (4&nbsp;[[inches|in]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gruenig.de/englisch/01_prod_04_anb_winter_02.htm|title=Snow sweepers|publisher=Gr<U+00FC>nig Industriemaschinen|accessdate=2007-07-22}}</ref> Snow deeper than this however can clog the brushes, and most snow sweepers cannot be used to clear snow deeper than 15&nbsp;centimetres (6&nbsp;in).<ref name="Egholm"/> A more advanced version of the snow sweeper is the jet sweeper, which adds an air-blower just behind the brushes, in order to blow the swept snow clear of the pavement and prevent the loosened snow from settling.<ref name="dressweep"/>

===Surface friction tester===
[[Image:Surface Friction Tester.jpg|thumb|A [[NASA]] surface friction tester at [[Langley Air Force Base]] - the extra wheel is clearly visible at the rear.]]

The surface friction tester is a small fifth wheel attached to a hydraulic system mounted on the rear axle of the vehicle, used to measure [[road slipperiness]]. The wheel, allowed to roll freely, is slightly [[Yaw angle|turned]] relative to the ground so that it partially slides. Sensors attached to the axis of the wheel calculate the friction between the wheel and the pavement by measuring the [[torque]] produced by the rotation of the wheel. Surface friction testers are used at airports and on major roadways before ice formation or after snow removal.<ref name="MK IV">{{cite web|url=http://www.asft.se/aviation/MKrear.html|title=MK IV rear axle system|publisher=Airport Surface Friction Testers|accessdate=2007-02-09}}</ref> The vehicle can relay the surface friction data back to the control centre, allowing gritting and clearing to be planned so that the vehicles are deployed most efficiently.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.dresden-airport.de/en/reisende_und_besucher/willkommen/wie_funktioniert/winterdienst/enteiser.html|title= Aircraft De-icing|publisher=[[Dresden Airport]]|accessdate=2007-02-09}}</ref> Surface friction testers often include a water spraying system, to simulate the effects of rain on the road surface before the rain occurs.<ref name="MK IV"/> The sensors are usually mounted to small [[Compact car|compact]] or [[estate car]]s or to a small [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailer]], rather than the large trucks used for other winter service equipment, as the surface friction tester works best when attached to a lightweight vehicle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asft.se/road/VWSharan.html|title=ASFT VW Sharan Road Surface Friction Tester|publisher=Airport Surface Friction Testers|accessdate=2007-04-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asft.se/road/t10Trailer.html|title=ASFT T-10 Trailer Road Surface Friction Tester|publisher=Airport Surface Friction Testers|accessdate=2007-04-19}}</ref><ref name="MK IV"/>
