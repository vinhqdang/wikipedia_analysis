'''Louis XV''' (15 February 1710 <U+2013> 10 May 1774), known as '''Louis the Well beloved''' (''Louis le bien aim<U+00E9>'') was a monarch of the [[House of Bourbon]] who ruled as [[List of French monarchs|King of France]] and [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] from 1 September 1715 until his death. He succeeded his great-grandfather [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] at the age of five. Until he reached maturity in 1723, his kingdom was ruled by [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl<U+00E9>ans]], his first cousin twice removed, as [[R<U+00E9>gence|Regent]] of France. [[Andr<U+00E9>-Hercule de Fleury|Cardinal Fleury]] was his chief minister from 1726 until the Cardinal's death in 1743, at which time the young king took over sole control of the kingdom.

During his reign, Louis's government returned the [[Austrian Netherlands]], won at the [[Battle of Fontenoy]] of 1745, but given back to Austria by the terms of the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] of 1748, and ceded most of [[New France]] to [[Great Britain]] at the conclusion of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763. His reign also saw the incorporation of the territories of [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] and [[Corsica]] into the kingdom of France. He was succeeded by his grandson [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] in 1774.

Most scholars believe Louis XV's decisions damaged the power of France, weakened the treasury, discredited the absolute monarchy. and made more vulnerable to distrust and destruction, as happened in the [[French Revolution]], which broke out 15 years after his death.<ref>{{cite book|author=J. H.

==Background and early life==
[[File:Nicolas de Largilli<U+00E8>re 003.jpg||thumb|left|Louis XV with his father Louis Duke of Burgundy,his grandfather Louis Le Grand Dauphin and his great-grandfather King Louis XIV]]

Louis XV was born in the [[Palace of Versailles]] on 15 February 1710 during the reign of his great-grandfather [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. His grandfather, Louis ''[[Le Grand Dauphin]]'', had three sons with his wife [[Marie Anne Victoire of Bavaria]]: [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1682-1712)|Louis, Duke of Burgundy]]; [[Philip V of Spain|Philippe, Duke of Anjou]] (who became King of Spain); and [[Charles de Bourbon, Duc de Berry|Charles, Duke of Berry]]. Louis XV was the third son of the Duke of Burgundy and his wife [[Marie Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de of Savoy]], the eldest daughter of [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|Victor Amadeus II, Duke of Savoy]], and [[Anne Marie d'Orl<U+00E9>ans]]. At birth, Louis XV received a customary title for younger sons of the French royal family: [[Duke of Anjou]].

[[File:Demi Louis Louis XV le Bien Aim<U+00E9>.jpg|thumb|Half-Louis de Noailles during Louis XV]]

In April 1711, Louis ''Le Grand Dauphin'' suddenly died, making Louis XV's father, the Duke of Burgundy, the new dauphin. At that time, Burgundy had two living sons, [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1707-1712)|Louis, Duke of Brittany]], and his youngest son, the future Louis XV.

A year later, Marie Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de, Duchess of Burgundy, contracted [[smallpox]] (or [[measles]]) and died on 12 February 1712. Her husband, said to be heartbroken by her death, died the same week, also having contracted smallpox. Within a week of his death, it was clear that the couple's two children had also been infected. The elder son was repeatedly treated by [[bloodletting]] in an unsuccessful effort to save him. Fearing that the Dauphin would die, the Court had both the Dauphin and the Duke of Anjou baptised. The Dauphin died the same day, 8 March 1712. His younger brother, the Duke of Anjou, was personally treated by his governess, [[Madame de Ventadour]], who forbade any bloodletting. As a result, he survived the smallpox, and became first in the line of succession to his great-grandfather Louis XIV at the age of two.

===Louis XIV's will===
[[Image:Sacre de Louis XV.jpg|right|180px||thumb|[[Anointing]] of Louis XV.]]
On 1 September 1715, [[Louis XIV]] died of [[gangrene]] after having reigned for 72 years.

In August 1714, Louis XIV made a will stipulating that the nation was to be governed by a Regency Council made up of fourteen members until the new king reached the age of majority. Philippe, Duke of Orl<U+00E9>ans, nephew of Louis XIV, was named president of the council, but all decisions were to be taken by majority vote. The composition of the council, which included Louis XIV's legitimised sons the [[Louis Auguste, Duke of Maine|Duke of Maine]] and [[Louis Alexandre, Count of Toulouse|Count of Toulouse]] and various members of Louis XIV's administration, meant that the Duke of Orl<U+00E9>ans would often be outvoted.

===Philippe, Duke of Orl<U+00E9>ans===
{{Main|R<U+00E9>gence}}

As regent, Orl<U+00E9>ans conducted affairs of state from his [[Palais Royal]]. The young Louis XV was moved to the modern lodgings attached to the medieval fortress of [[Vincennes]], located 7&nbsp;km/4.5 miles east of Paris in the Forest of Vincennes. The air was deemed more wholesome than in Paris. A few weeks later with winter, the young king was moved to the [[Tuileries Palace]] near the Palais Royal.

===Youth===
By French royal tradition, princes were put in the care of men when they reached their seventh birthday. Louis was taken from his governess, Madame de Ventadour, in February 1717, and placed in the care of the [[Fran<U+00E7>ois de Neufville, duc de Villeroi|Francois de Villeroy]], who had been designated as his governor in Louis XIV's will of August 1714. (Duke Fran<U+00E7>ois de Neufville de Villeroy was a lifetime friend of Louis XIV - they had spend their childhoon together at the H<U+00F4>tel de Villeroy (today private residences and expo center Cremerie de Paris) and the Palais Royal. Francois de Villeroy (more rarely spelled Villeroi) served under the formal authority of the Duke of Maine, who was charged with overseeing the king's education. He was aided by [[Andr<U+00E9>-Hercule de Fleury]] (later to become Cardinal de Fleury), who served as the king's tutor.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Fleury gave the king an excellent education, and he was also taught by renowned professors such as the geographer [[Guillaume Delisle]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Louis XV had an inquisitive and open-minded nature. An avid reader, he developed eclectic tastes. Later in life he advocated the creation of departments in physics (1769) and mechanics (1773) at the [[Coll<U+00E8>ge de France]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===Betrothal and marriage===
[[File:Infanta Mariana Victoria of Spain.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Infante|Infanta]] [[Mariana Victoria of Spain|Maria Anna Victoria of Spain]], to whom Louis was engaged.]]
In 1721, Louis XV was betrothed to his first cousin, the [[Infante|Infanta]] [[Mariana Victoria of Spain|Maria Anna Victoria of Spain]], but the eleven-year-old king was not interested in the arrival of his future wife, the three-year-old Spanish [[Infante|Infanta]]. In June 1722, the king and the court returned to Versailles, where they would stay until the end of the reign. In October of the same year, Louis XV was officially crowned in [[Notre-Dame de Reims|Reims Cathedral]].

On 15 February 1723, the king's majority was declared by the [[Parlement]] of Paris. This ended the regency. Initially, Louis XV left the Duke of Orl<U+00E9>ans in charge of state affairs. He was made first minister on the death of Cardinal Dubois in August 1723; he himself died in December of the same year. Following the advice of Fleury, Louis XV appointed his cousin [[Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon]], to replace the late Duke of Orl<U+00E9>ans.

The Duke of Bourbon was worried about the health of the young king. His primary motivation was a desire to prevent the family of the late regent, the [[House of Orl<U+00E9>ans]], from ascending to the throne should the king die, as he considered Orl<U+00E9>ans family his enemy. The king was quite frail as a boy, and several alerts led to concern for his life. There was also concern that the Spanish infanta was too young to produce an heir. To remedy this situation, the Duke of Bourbon set about choosing a European princess old enough to produce an heir.

Eventually, the 21-year-old [[Marie Leszczy<U+0144>ska]], daughter of [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Leszczy<U+0144>ski]], the deposed king of [[Poland]], was chosen. A poor and plain-looking princess who had followed her father's misfortunes, she was said to be virtuous. The marriage was celebrated in September 1725. It soon produced many children. In September 1729, at the end of her third pregnancy, the queen finally gave birth to a male child, [[Dauphin of France|an heir to the throne]], the dauphin [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1729-1765)|Louis]] (1729<U+2013>1765). The birth of a long-awaited heir, which ensured the survival of the dynasty for the first time since 1712, was welcomed with tremendous joy and celebration in all spheres of French society. The young king became extremely popular at the time.

===Dismissal of Bourbon and the Ministry of Fleury===
The ministry of the Duke of Bourbon pursued policies that resulted in serious economic and social problems in France. These included the persecution of Protestants; monetary manipulations; the creation of new taxes, such as the fiftieth (''cinquanti<U+00E8>me'') in 1725; and tolerance of high grain prices. As a result of Bourbon's rising unpopularity, the king dismissed him in 1726. The king selected his former tutor, Cardinal Fleury, to replace him.

From 1726 until his death in 1743, Cardinal Fleury ruled France with the king's assent. It was the most peaceful and prosperous part of the reign of Louis XV, despite some unrest caused by the ''Parlements'' and the [[Jansenists]]. After the financial and social disruptions suffered at the end of the reign of Louis XIV, the rule of Fleury is seen by historians as a period of "recovery." The king's role in the decisions of the Fleury government is unclear, but he did support him against the intrigues of the court and the conspiracies of the courtiers.
[[File:Louis XV France by Louis-Michel van Loo 002.jpg|thumb|left|Louis XV, by [[Louis Michel van Loo]], ([[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Versailles]]).]]
With the help of [[Controller-General of Finances|controllers-general of finances]] Michel Robert Le Peletier des Forts (1726<U+2013>1730) and [[Philibert Orry]] (1730<U+2013>1745), Fleury stabilized the French currency and balanced the budget in 1738. Economic expansion was a major goal of the government. Communications were improved with the completion of the Saint-Quentin canal (linking the [[Oise River|Oise]] and [[Somme River|Somme]] rivers) in 1738, which was later extended to the [[Escaut River]] and the [[Low Countries]], and the systematic building of a national road network. By the middle of the 18th century, France had the most modern and extensive road network in the world.

Engineers from the [[<U+00C9>cole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss<U+00E9>es]] built modern highways, many of which are still in use today, that stretched from Paris to the most distant borders of France. The Council of Commerce stimulated trade, and French foreign maritime trade increased from 80 to 308&nbsp;million ''[[livre tournois|livres]]'' between 1716 and 1748. Rigid [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbertist]] laws left over from the previous reign hindered industrial development, however.

The power of the [[absolute monarchy]] was manifested by its suppression of Jansenist and Gallican religious opposition. The troubles caused by the [[convulsionaries]] of the Saint-M<U+00E9>dard graveyard in Paris (a group of Jansenists claiming that miracles took place in this graveyard) were put to an end in 1732. As for the Gallican opposition, after the dismissal of 139 members of provincial ''parlements'', the ''Parlement'' of Paris had to register the ''Unigenitus'' papal bull and was forbidden to hear religious cases in the future.

In foreign relations, Fleury sought peace by attempting to maintain alliance with England and pursuing reconciliation with Spain. The birth of a male heir in 1729 dispelled the risks of a succession crisis and the possibility of war with Spain.

In 1733, on the advice of his [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (France)|secretary of state for foreign affairs]] [[Germain Louis Chauvelin]], the king abandoned Fleury's peace policy to intervene in the [[War of the Polish Succession]].  In addition to attempting to restore his father-in-law Stanis<U+0142>aw Leszczy<U+0144>ski to the Polish throne, the king also hoped to wrest the long-coveted [[Duchy of Lorraine]] from its duke, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis III]]. The duke's expected marriage to [[Maria Theresa of Austria]], daughter of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]], would bring Austrian power dangerously close to the French border. In the end, the half-hearted French intervention did not allow Stanis<U+0142>aw to recover his former throne in Poland.

===Treaty of Vienna===
[[File:Mehmed Effendi 1721.jpg|thumb|Ottoman ambassador [[Yirmisekiz Mehmed <U+00C7>elebi Efendi]] in Paris in 1721 (engraving)]]
In the west, however, French troops rapidly overran Lorraine, and peace was restored as early as 1735. By the [[Treaty of Vienna (1738)|Treaty of Vienna]] (November 1738), Stanis<U+0142>aw was compensated for the loss of his Polish throne with the duchy of Lorraine, which would eventually pass to King Louis as his son-in-law, while Duke Francis III of Lorraine was made heir to the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] as compensation for the loss of Lorraine. The war cost France very little compared to the financial and human drains of Louis XIV's wars and was a clear success for French diplomacy. The acquisition of Lorraine (effective in 1766 at Stanis<U+0142>aw's death) was to be the last territorial expansion of France on the continent before the [[French Revolution]].

Shortly after this favourable result, France's mediation in the war between the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] led to the [[Treaty of Belgrade]] (September 1739), which favoured the Ottoman Empire, beneficiary of a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]] against the [[Habsburg]]s since the early 16th century. As a result, the Ottoman Empire in 1740 renewed the French [[capitulations (Ottoman)|capitulations]], which marked the supremacy of French trade in the Middle East. With these successes, Louis XV's prestige reached its highest point.

==The War of the Austrian Succession and first signs of unpopularity==
{{main|War of the Austrian Succession}}

In 1740, the death of Emperor Charles VI and his succession by his daughter Maria Theresa started the European [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. Sensing the vulnerability of Maria Theresa's position, King [[Frederick the Great]] of [[Prussia]] invaded the Austrian province of [[Silesia]] in hopes of annexing it permanently.  The elderly Cardinal Fleury had too little energy left to oppose this war, which was strongly supported by the anti-Austrian party at court. Renewing the cycle of conflicts so typical of Louis XIV's reign, the king entered the war in 1741 on the side of Prussia in hopes of pursuing its own anti-Austrian foreign policy goals. The war would last seven years. Fleury did not live to see the end of the war.  After Fleury's death, in January 1743, the king followed his predecessor's example (at the death of [[Cardinal Mazarin]]) of ruling from then on without a first minister.

Initially, France experienced military success despite the king's loss of his trusted advisor. In alliance with the Prussians against the Austrians, British, and Dutch, the French were able to savor a series of major victories at the Battles of [[Battle of Fontenoy|Fontenoy]] (1745), [[Battle of Rocoux|Rocoux]] (1746), and [[Battle of Lauffeld|Lauffeld]] (1747). The Battle of Fontenoy, won by [[Maurice de Saxe]], is still remembered as one of the most decisive French victories against the British. In 1746 French forces [[Siege of Brussels|besieged and occupied Brussels]], which Louis entered in triumph. By 1748, France occupied the entire [[Southern Netherlands|Austrian Netherlands]] (modern-day [[Belgium]]), then the wealthiest area of Europe, and appeared on its way to fulfilling its traditional dream of extending its north-eastern border to the [[Rhine]].

===Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle===
Despite his victory, Louis XV, who wanted to appear as an arbiter and not as a conqueror, agreed to restore all his conquests back to the defeated enemies with chivalry at the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1748, arguing that he was "king of France, not a shopkeeper."  He felt content to rule a nearly [[hexagon]]-shaped kingdom, which he called his ''pr<U+00E9> carr<U+00E9>'' (i.e. "square field"), a term still used in French politics today. He thought it better to cultivate the ''pr<U+00E9> carr<U+00E9>'' rather than trying to expand it. The attitude of the king was hailed in Europe, and he became known overnight the "arbiter of Europe". This decision, largely misunderstood by his generals and by the French people, made the king unpopular at home. The news that the king had restored the Southern Netherlands to Austria was met with disbelief and bitterness. The French obtained so little of what they fought for that they adopted the expressions ''B<U+00EA>te comme la paix'' ("Stupid as the peace") and ''Travailler pour le roi de Prusse'' ("To work for the king of Prussia", i.e. working for nothing).

Louis's popularity was also threatened by public exposure of his marital infidelities, which likely could have been kept concealed had France not entered the War of the Austrian Succession.  Louis had enjoyed a good deal of happiness with his wife, but he resented her failure to produce a good supply of male children (only one male child, the Dauphin Louis, survived among her many offspring). In 1734, for the first time, the queen complained to her father about the king's infidelities. The king took mistresses, a recognized practice at the time, while the queen took refuge in religion and charities. The designation ''[[ma<U+00EE>tresse-en-titre]]'' ("official mistress") was a court position that was sometimes retained even if the king and his mistress ceased being lovers. In the 1730s, Louis began a series of love affairs with four sisters of the Mailly-Nesle family that are documented by the formal agreements into which he entered: [[Diane Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de de Mailly]] (his first mistress), [[Louise Julie de Mailly]], [[Pauline F<U+00E9>licit<U+00E9> de Mailly]], and [[Marie Anne de Mailly]].

In June 1744, the king left Versailles for the front in order to take personal command of his armies fighting in the War of the Austrian Succession.  This otherwise popular move was marred by the king's indiscreet decision to bring along Marie Anne de Mailly, whom he had ennobled as the Duchess of Ch<U+00E2>teauroux.  In August, the king fell gravely ill in [[Metz]]. Death appeared imminent, and public prayers were held all across France to ask God to save the king from a certain death.

Pressed by the anti-absolutist ''[[d<U+00E9>vots|d<U+00E9>vot]]'' party at court, the king's chaplain refused to give him [[absolution (religious)|absolution]] unless the king renounced his mistress. The king's confession was distributed publicly, which embarrassed him and tarnished the prestige of the monarchy. Although Louis's recovery earned him the epithet "well-beloved" from a public relieved by his survival, the events at Metz diminished his standing.  The military successes of the War of the Austrian Succession inclined the French public to overlook Louis's adulteries, but after 1748, in the wake of the anger over the terms of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, pamphlets against the king's mistresses became increasingly widely published and read.

==Madame de Pompadour==
[[Image:Fran<U+00E7>ois Boucher 019.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Madame de Pompadour]], by Fran<U+00E7>ois Boucher, ca. 1750]]
[[Madame de Pompadour|Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson]], later the Marquise de Pompadour, who met Louis XV in February 1745 at a masked ball given in honour of the marriage of the Dauphin, was one of the most famous mistresses of the reign, and also the most honourable one. She was the daughter of a chief agent of the powerful Paris family of financiers who became embroiled in the intrigue that ousted the Duke of Bourbon as a state minister in favour of Cardinal Fleury. A beautiful woman, she was educated, cultured, intelligent, and sincerely attached to the king. Nonetheless, she possessed one major shortcoming in everyone's eyes: she was a commoner, from the [[bourgeoisie]], and even worse, a commoner who meddled in royal politics.

The public had generally accepted the mistresses of Louis XIV, who, apart from [[Madame de Maintenon]], were all chosen in the highest spheres of the aristocracy and had very little influence on the government. But that the king would thus compromise himself with a commoner was felt to be a disgrace. Soon there were libels published called ''poissonnades'', a word akin to "fish stew" meant to be a [[pun]] on Pompadour's family name, ''Poisson'', which means "fish" in French.

Despite her critics, the Marquise de Pompadour had an undeniable influence on the flourishing of French arts during the reign of Louis XV, a reign that is often considered to represent the pinnacle of French architecture and interior design (see: [[Louis Quinze]]). A patron of the arts, the Marquise amassed a considerable amount of furniture and ''[[work of art|objets d'art]]'' at her various estates. She was responsible for the tremendous growth of the porcelain manufactory of [[S<U+00E8>vres]], which became one of the most famous porcelain manufacturers in Europe, and her commissions ensured the living of artists and families of craftsmen for many years. She was also a prominent patron of architecture, responsible for the building of the Place Louis XV (now called the [[Place de la Concorde]]) and the [[<U+00C9>cole Militaire]] in Paris, both designed by her ''prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>'' [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]]. Her efforts to establish the ''<U+00C9>cole Militaire'' demonstrated her commitment to the training of officers from poor families of the aristocracy.

The Marquise was a political liberal at heart, and she steadily defended the ''[[Encyclop<U+00E9>die]]'' against the attacks from the Church. She was also a supporter of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophy and tried to win the king over to its new ideas, albeit not quite as successfully as she hoped. She was criticised for the lavish display of luxury at her various estates, although her wealthy family of financiers in many instances gave money to the government and saved the monarchy from bankruptcy. She bequeathed all her estates to the state, and they reverted to the crown at her death.

The Marquise de Pompadour was officially settled on the third floor (second storey) of the [[Palace of Versailles]] in small but comfortable apartments that can still be visited today. There, she organised fine suppers for the king with carefully selected guests, far from the pomp and etiquette of the court. The atmosphere in these private quarters was so relaxed that the king was said to serve coffee during the suppers. She often entertained the king, trying to relieve him from the state of boredom in which the court often plunged him. The king, who liked a more bourgeois lifestyle than his forefather Louis XIV, found in the private apartments of the Marquise de Pompadour, located above his own office and bedchamber, the intimacy and reassuring feminine presence of which he had been deprived during his childhood.

The Marquise, who was reportedly in frail health, was no more than a friend to the king after 1750. Although their sexual relationship stopped, she remained his close confidante until her death, quite a feat in the history of royal mistresses. She, more than anyone else, was adept at understanding the complex and demanding personality of the king. After 1750, the king was mired in a series of short-lived love affairs and sexual relationships, hiding his temporary conquests in a small mansion at the ''Parc-aux-Cerfs'' ("Stags' Park") at Versailles, whose most famous occupant was [[Marie-Louise O'Murphy]]. Legend later enormously exaggerated the events occurring at the ''Parc-aux-Cerfs'', contributing to the dark reputation still associated with Louis XV's name today. In fact, the king's womanising behavior was not very different from that of many of his illustrious ancestors, such as Kings [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], and Louis XIV, to say nothing of other European monarchs such as [[Charles II of England]].

==First attempt at reform==
[[File:Head of King Louis XV by Fran<U+00E7>ois Lemoyne.jpg|left|thumb|Portrait of Louis XV, ca. 1730.]]

Starting in 1743 with the death of Fleury, the king ruled alone without a first minister. He had read many times the instructions of Louis XIV: "Listen to the people, seek advice from your Council, but decide alone." His political correspondence reveals his deep knowledge of public affairs as well as the soundness of his judgment. Most government work was conducted in committees of ministers that met without the king. The king reviewed policy only in the ''Conseil d'en haut'', the High Council, which was composed of the king, the Dauphin, the chancellor, the finance minister, and the foreign minister. Created by Louis XIV, the council was in charge of state policy regarding religion, diplomacy, and war. There, he let various political factions oppose each other and vie for influence and power: on the broadest level, the ''d<U+00E9>vot'' party, led by the [[Marc Pierre de Voyer de Paulmy, comte d'Argenson|Comte d'Argenson]], [[List of Defense Ministers of France|secretary of state for war]], opposed the ''parti philosophique'', which supported Enlightenment philosophy and was led by finance minister [[Jean Baptiste de Machault D'Arnouville]].

The ''parti philosophique'' was supported by the Marquise de Pompadour, who acted as a sort of [[minister without portfolio]] from the time she became royal mistress in 1745 until her death in 1764. The Marquise was in favour of reforms. Supported by her clan of financiers (P<U+00E2>ris-Duverney, Montmartel, etc.), she obtained from the king the appointment of ministers (such as the foreign minister [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Joachim de Pierre de Bernis]] in 1757), as well as their dismissal (such as Philippe Orry in 1745 and the Navy secretary [[Jean-Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Ph<U+00E9>lypeaux, comte de Maurepas|Maurepas]] in 1749). On her advice, the king supported the policy of fiscal justice designed by Machault d'Arnouville. In order to finance the budget deficit, which amounted to 100&nbsp;million ''[[livre tournois|livres]]'' in 1745, Machault d'Arnouville created a tax on the twentieth of all revenues that affected the privileged classes as well as commoners.

This breach in the privileged status of the aristocracy and the clergy, normally exempt from taxes, was a first in French history, although it had already been advocated by men such as [[Vauban]] under Louis XIV. However, the new tax was received with violent protest from the privileged classes sitting in the estates of the few provinces that still retained the right to decide over taxation (most provinces had long lost their provincial estates and the right to decide over taxation). The new tax was also opposed by the clergy and by the ''parlements''. Pressed and eventually won over by his entourage at court, the king gave in and exempted the clergy from the twentieth in 1751. Eventually, the twentieth became a mere increase in the already existing ''[[taille]]'', the most important direct tax of the monarchy from which privileged classes were exempted. It was the first defeat in the "taxation war" waged against the privileged classes.

As a result of these attempts at reform, the ''Parlement'' of Paris, using the quarrel between the clergy and the Jansenists as a pretext, addressed remonstrances to the king in April 1753. In these remonstrances, the ''Parlement'', which was made up of privileged aristocrats and ennobled commoners, proclaimed itself the "natural defender of the fundamental laws of the kingdom" against the arbitrariness of the monarchy.

==Seven Years' War==
{{Main|France in the Seven Years' War}}
By 1755, a new European conflict was brewing. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle turned out to be only a sort of truce in the conflict between Austria and Prussia over the province of Silesia, and France and Britain were quarreling seriously over colonial possessions. Indeed, the French and British were fighting without a declaration of war in a conflict known as the [[French and Indian War]] of 1754-1763. In 1755, the British seized 300 French merchant ships in violation of [[international law]]. A few months later, on 16 January 1756, Great Britain and Prussia, enemies in the War of the Austrian Succession, signed a treaty of "neutrality".

Frederick the Great had abandoned his French ally during the War of Austrian Succession by signing a separate peace treaty with Austria in December 1745. At the same time, French officials realized that the Habsburg empire of Maria Theresa of Austria was no longer the danger it had been in the heyday of the Habsburgs, back in the 16th and 17th centuries, when they controlled Spain and much of the rest of Europe and presented a formidable challenge to France. The new dangerous power looming on the horizon was Prussia. In a "[[stately quadrille|diplomatic revolution]]", the king overruled his ministers and signed the [[Treaty of Versailles (1756)|Treaty of Versailles]] with Austria on 1 April 1756, and put an end to more than 200 years of conflict with the Habsburgs. The new [[Franco-Austrian Alliance]] would last intermittently for the next thirty-five years.

Louis apparently expected that his alliance with Austria would prevent another war on the continent by confronting Prussia with two continental powers arrayed against him instead of just one, as had been the way during the War of the Austrian Succession.  He was mistaken. Austria was determined to retrieve Silesia from Prussian control.  At the end of August 1756, having learned that Austria was negotiating to enlist Russia against him, Frederick the Great invaded [[Saxony]] without a declaration of war. He soon defeated the unprepared Saxon and Austrian armies and occupied the whole of the country. The younger daughter of the Saxon ruler, [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus III]], was the dauphin's wife, and his elder daughter was married to [[Charles VII of Naples]], a Bourbon cousin. Frederick's treatment of the Polish<U+2013>Saxon royal family was seen as uncommonly disrespectful. Moreover, Augustus' wife [[Maria Josepha of Austria|Maria Josepha]], mother of the dauphine [[Marie-Jos<U+00E9>phe of Saxony]], died in 1757 from a stroke that some in France attributed to maltreatment, without evidence. Rumours of Frederick's actions shocked the French and inflamed public opinion against Prussia. The dauphine had a miscarriage as a result of the news coming from Saxony. Meanwhile, Britain declared war on France on 18 May 1756.

The French military successes of the War of the Austrian Succession were not repeated in the Seven Years' War, except for a few temporary victories such as the [[Battle of Minorca (1756)|Battle of Minorca of 1756]]. A French [[Invasion of Hanover (1757)|invasion of Hanover]] in 1757 resulted in a counter-attack led by [[Ferdinand of Brunswick]] the following year that saw them driven out of the electorate. Plans for an [[Planned French Invasion of Britain (1759)|invasion of Britain]] in 1759 were never carried out due to catastrophic naval defeats. French forces suffered disaster after disaster against the British in North America, [[India]], and [[Africa]].  The 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] with Great Britain forced France to surrender almost all of New France and drastically curtail its political influence in India.  The French navy was crippled, but France suffered no territorial losses on the continent of Europe by the terms of the [[Treaty of Hubertusberg]] of 1763 with Prussia.

==Assassination attempt==

On 5 January 1757, would-be [[assassination|assassin]] [[Robert-Fran<U+00E7>ois Damiens]] entered the Palace of Versailles, as did thousands of people every day, to petition the king. At 6&nbsp;pm, as night had fallen on a cold Versailles covered in snow, the king, who was visiting his daughter, left her apartments to return to the [[Grand Trianon]], where he was staying. As he was walking in the Marble Courtyard between two lines of guards lighting the way with torches, headed toward his carriage (which was waiting at the edge of the Marble Courtyard), Damiens emerged from the dark, passed through the guards, and stabbed the king in the side with a penknife.

[[Image:Robert-damiens.jpg|left|thumb|Robert-Fran<U+00E7>ois Damiens, by [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]] (1757).]]
The ''8.1&nbsp;cm (3.2&nbsp;inch)'' blade entered the king's body between the fourth and fifth ribs. The king, who was bleeding, remained calm and called for a confessor as he thought he would die. Thoughts of poison came to his mind. At the sight of the queen, who had come in a hurry, he asked for forgiveness for his misbehaviour. However, the king survived. He was probably saved by the thick layers of clothes he wore on that cold day, which cushioned the blade, protecting the internal organs. Allegedly, the blade penetrated only 1&nbsp;cm (0.4&nbsp;inch) into the king's body, leading [[Voltaire]] to mock what he called a "pinprick".

Tried by the ''Parlement'' of Paris, Damiens was tortured and executed on the [[Place de Gr<U+00E8>ve]] on 28 March 1757.

After the assassination attempt, and at Pompadour's instigation, the king dismissed two ministers: the [[Marc Pierre de Voyer de Paulmy, comte d'Argenson|Comte d'Argenson]], [[List of Defense Ministers of France|secretary of state for war]], and Machault d'Arnouville, [[List of Justice Ministers of France|keeper of the seals]] (justice minister) and before that [[List of Finance Ministers of France|controller-general of finances]]. To help coordinate the government of France, he appointed the [[<U+00C9>tienne Fran<U+00E7>ois, duc de Choiseul|Duke of Choiseul]] as Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Reforms would resume only with the dismissal of Choiseul in 1771. In that year, Louis XV installed a so-called Triumvirate consisting of [[Ren<U+00E9> Nicolas Charles Augustin de Maupeou|Ren<U+00E9> Nicolas de Maupeou]] as Chancellor of France and Minister of Justice, [[Joseph Marie Terray]] as Minister of Finance, and [[Emmanuel-Armand de Richelieu, duc d'Aiguillon]], as Minister for Foreign Affairs. They fought against the ''Parlements'' and had the judiciary run by the Council of State. Louis XVI restored the ''Parlements'' and removed the triumvirs from their posts.

Louis and his ministers were unhappy about Great Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War and in the years following the Treaty of Paris they began drawing up a long-term plan that would involve the construction of a larger navy and the formation of an anti-British coalition of states that would lead to an eventual war of revenge with the goal of regaining France's lost overseas colonies. Choiseul was the leading advocate of this scheme, and he was prepared to go to war with Britain over the [[Falklands Crisis (1770)|Falkland Islands]] in 1770. Louis, however, did not believe that France was ready for war at that time and dismissed Choiseul instead.

Throughout the second half of his reign, Louis XV endured conflict and intrigue from his children, particularly his son Louis (the dauphin), and his eldest surviving daughter, [[Princess Marie Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de of France|Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de]]. The intrigue of family politics took place within the environs of Versailles, an environment that was under his control. Louis XV used his court to oversee and counter his children's politics and intrigues. Louis XV remodeled the spaces at Versailles to communicate his satisfaction and displeasure with his children and other members of the court.<ref>Kevin L. Justus, "Gilded Palace, Gilded Playpen: Louis XV's Use of Palatial Space to Control His Rebellious Children and Their Politics," ''Journal of Family History '' 1996 21(4): 470<U+2013>495. Issn: 0363-1990</ref>

===Death===
Louis XV died on 10 May 1774 of [[smallpox]] at the [[Palace of Versailles]].<ref>Bauer, Susan Wise, ''The Story of the World: Early modern times, from Elizabeth the First to the Forty-Niners'', (Peace Hill Press Inc., 2004), 206.</ref> He was the first Bourbon ruler whose heart was not, as tradition demanded, cut out and placed in a special coffer.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The body was not embalmed for fear of contamination; instead, alcohol was poured into the coffin.<ref>Mme Campan, ''Memoirs of the private life of Marie Antoinette, queen of France'', 2nd edition, Vol. I (London, 1823), 75-76.</ref> The remains were also soaked in [[quicklime]].<ref>Bauer, 206</ref> In a surreptitious late-night ceremony attended by only one courtier, the body was taken to the [[Saint Denis Basilica]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Louis's death saw the French monarchy at its nadir in political, financial and moral terms.<ref>{{cite book|author=Andrew Hussey|title=Paris: The Secret History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4BBlHKk53VIC&pg=PT172|year=2008|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|page=172}}</ref>  Since Louis XV's son Louis had died nine years earlier, the throne passed to his grandson, the conventional and unimaginative Louis XVI. Two of Louis XV's other grandsons, [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] and [[Charles X of France|Charles X]], would occupy the throne of France after the fall of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]].

==Image, public opinion and history==
[[File:Edm<U+00E9> Bouchardon - Study for the Equestrian Statue of Louis XV - WGA02875.jpg|thumb|left|Edm<U+00E9> Bouchardon's sketch for the Equestrian Statue of Louis XV.]]
[[Edm<U+00E9> Bouchardon]]'s equestrian statue of Louis XV was originally conceived to commemorate the monarch's victorious role in the War of the Austrian Succession. He portrayed the king as peacemaker. It was not unveiled until 1763, following France's defeat in the Seven Years' War. Designed as a symbol of loyalty to the king, Bouchardon's work was used by the Crown for a public relations event staged to restore public confidence in a monarchy in decline. It used art as propaganda on a grand scale.<ref>Stephen Rombouts, "Art as Propaganda in Eighteenth-century France: the Paradox of Edme Bouchardon's Louis XV". ''Eighteenth-century Studies,'' 1993<U+2013>1994 27(2): 255<U+2013>282.  [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2739383 in JSTOR]</ref> This statue was located on the ''[[Place de la Concorde|Place Louis XV]]'' and was torn down during the [[French Revolution|Revolution]].

Many scholars argue that Louis was unequal to the high expectations of his subjects. Harris says that, "Historians have depicted this ruler as one of the weakest of the Bourbons, a do-nothing king who left affairs of state to ministers while indulging in his hobbies of hunting and womanizing."<ref>Robert D. Harris, "Review," ''American Historical Review'' (1987) 92#2 p. 426</ref> Harris adds that ministers rose and fell according to his mistresses' opinions, seriously undermining the prestige of the monarchy.

[[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], the leader of the French [[Annales School]], notes the king was handsome, athletic, intelligent and an excellent hunter, but that he disappointed the people.  He did not keep up the practice of Mass and performing his religious obligations to the people. Le Roy Ladurie says the people felt he had reduced the sacred nature of the monarchy,  and thereby diminished himself.<ref>Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, ''The Ancien Regime: A History of France, 1610 - 1774'' (1998) pp 320-23</ref>

According to Kenneth N. Jassie and Jeffrey Merrick, contemporary songs, poems, and public declarations typically portrayed a king as "master," unblemished "Christian," and benevolent provider ("baker"). Young Louis's failings were attributed to inexperience and manipulation by his handlers. Jassie and Merrick argue that the king's troubles mounted steadily, and the people blamed and ridiculed his debauchery. The king ignored the famines and crises of the nation. The people reviled the king in popular protest, and finally celebrated his death. The monarchy survived<U+2014>for a while<U+2014>but Louis XV left his successor with a damaging legacy of popular discontent.<ref>Kenneth N. Jassie and Jeffrey Merrick, "We Don't Have a King: Popular Protest and the Image of the Illegitimate King in the Reign of Louis XV," ''Consortium on Revolutionary Europe 1750<U+2013>1850: Proceedings'' 1994 23: 211<U+2013>219. Issn: 0093-2574</ref>

Some sermons on his death in 1774 praised the monarch and went out of their way to excuse his faults. Jeffrey Merrick writes, "But those ecclesiastics who not only raised their eyebrows over the sins of the Beloved but also expressed doubts about his policies reflected the corporate attitude of the First Estate more accurately." They prayed the new king would restore morality at court and better serve the will of God.<ref>Jeffrey Merrick, "Politics in the Pulpit: Ecclesiastical Discourse on the Death of Louis XV," ''History of European Ideas'' 1986 7(2): 149<U+2013>160. Issn: 0191-6599</ref>

The financial strain imposed by these wars and by the excesses of the royal court, and the consequent dissatisfaction with the monarchy, contributed to the national unrest which culminated in the [[French Revolution]] of 1789.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/louis_xv.shtml BBC History : Louis XV ((1710-1774))]</ref> The historian [[Colin Jones (historian)|Colin Jones]] argues that Louis XV left France with serious financial difficulties: "The military disasters of the Seven Years War led to acute state financial crisis.".<ref>Colin Jones, "The Other Cheek," ''History Today'' (Nov 2011) 61#11 pp 18-24</ref>  Ultimately, he writes, Louis XV failed to overcome these fiscal problems, mainly because he was incapable of putting together conflicting parties and interests in his entourage. Although aware of the forces of anti-monarchism threatening his family's rule, he did not do anything to stop them.<ref>Jones (2002) p, 124, 132<U+2013>33, 147</ref>

Two scholars of the 1980s defended Louis XV. Olivier Bernier in his 1984 biography argues that Louis was both popular and a leader in reforming France. In his 64-year reign, no foreign army crossed the French border, and her people were not threatened by conquest. He was known popularly as ''Le Bien-aim<U+00E9>'' (the well-beloved). Many of his subjects prayed for his recovery during his serious illness in Metz in 1744. His dismissal of the ''Parlement'' of Paris and his chief minister, Choisieul, in 1771, were attempts to wrest control of government from those Louis considered corrupt. He changed the tax code to try to balance the national budget. Bernier argues that these acts would have avoided the French Revolution, but his successor, Louis XVI, reversed his policies.<ref>Olivier Bernier, ''Louis the Beloved: The Life of Louis XV'' (1984), pp. 218-52</ref> Guy Chaussinand-Nogaret, wrote that Louis XV's tarnished reputation was created fifteen years after his death, to justify the French Revolution, and that the nobility during his reign were competent.<ref>Chaussinard-Nogaret, Guy. ''The French Nobility in the Eighteenth Century: From Feudalism to Enlightenment,'' Cambridge, England. Cambridge University Press, 1985</ref>

[[E.H. Gombrich]], better known as an art historian, wrote in 2005, "Louis XV and Louis XVI, the Sun King's [Louis XIV] successors, were incompetent, and content merely to imitate their great predecessor's outward show of power. The pomp and magnificence remained....Finance ministers soon became expert swindlers, cheating and extorting on a grand scale.  The peasants worked till they dropped and citizens were forced to pay huge taxes."<ref>{{cite book|author=E. H. Gombrich|title=A Little History of the World|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=P1HC0-zhJlkC&pg=PT216|year=2005|publisher=Yale U.P. |page=216}}</ref>

Jeffrey Merrick claims that his weak and ineffective rule accelerated the general decline that culminated in the [[French Revolution]] in 1789. The king was a notorious womaniser; the monarch's virility was supposed to be another way in which his power was manifested. Nevertheless, Merrick writes, popular faith in the monarchy was shaken by the scandals of Louis<U+2019>s private life and by the end of his life he had become despised.<ref>Jeffrey Merrick, "Politics in the Pulpit: Ecclesiastical Discourse on the Death of Louis XV," ''History of European Ideas'' 1986 7(2): 149<U+2013>160</ref>

Historians agree that in terms of culture and art, France reached a high point under Louis XV. However, he was blamed for the many diplomatic, military and economic reverses.  His reign was marked by ministerial instability while his  "prestige was ruined by military failure and colonial losses," concludes Jean-Denis Lepage.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jean-Denis G. G. Lepage|title=French Fortifications, 1715-1815: An Illustrated History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aeVAPShsbTMC&pg=PA6|year=2009|publisher=McFarland|page=6}}</ref>

Popular legend holds that Louis said, "After me, the flood" (''"Apr<U+00E8>s moi, le d<U+00E9>luge"''). This quotation is attributed to [[Madame de Pompadour]], although it is not certain that even she ever said it.<ref>Jones (2002) p. 236</ref>

==Louis XV in popular culture==
