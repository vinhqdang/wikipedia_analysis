'''Charlotte "Lottie" Dod''' ([[24 September]] [[1871]] &ndash; [[27 June]] [[1960]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] athlete best known as a [[tennis]] player. She won the [[Wimbledon Championships]] five times, the first when she was only fifteen, in the summer of [[1887 in sports|1887]].  She remains the youngest player to win the women's singles tournament, though [[Martina Hingis]] was three days younger when she won the women's doubles title in [[1997 in sports|1997]].

In addition to tennis, Dod competed in many other sports, including [[golf]], [[field hockey]], and [[archery]]. In addition to other successes, she won the [[British Ladies Amateur Golf Championship]], played for the British national field hockey team, and won a silver medal at the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] in archery. The ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' has named her as the most versatile female athlete of all time, together with [[track and field]] athlete and fellow golf player [[Babe Zaharias]].

==Early life==

Dod was born in [[Bebington]], [[Cheshire]] to Joseph and Margaret Dod. Joseph Dod, from [[Liverpool]], had made a fortune in the [[cotton]] trade. The family was wealthy enough to provide for all members for life; Lottie and her brother [[William Dod|Willy]] never had to work. Besides Willy, Lottie Dod had a sister, Annie, and another brother, Tony. Like their sister, they all excelled in sports. Annie was a good tennis player, golfer, [[ice skating|ice skater]] and [[billiards]] player. Willy Dod won the Olympic gold medal in archery at the [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Games]], while Tony was a regional level archer and a [[chess]] and tennis player. When Dod was nine years old, two tennis courts were built near the family's estate ''Edgeworth''. Lawn tennis, invented in 1873, was highly fashionable for the wealthy in England, and all of the Dod children started playing the game frequently.

== Tennis ==
[[Image:Lottie_Dod.jpg|thumb|right|Lottie Dod, here shown at age 14, debuted in tennis at age 11 and won her first Wimbledon title when she was 15. The press dubbed her the "Little Wonder".]]

Together with Annie, who was eight years older, Dod entered her first tennis tournament, the [[1883 in sports|1883]] Northern Championships in [[Manchester]], at age eleven. They lost in the first round of the doubles tournament, but won the consolation tournament. One journalist noted that "Miss L. Dod should be heard of in the future". He turned out to be correct.

At the same tournament in [[1885 in sports|1885]], she came to prominence when she nearly beat reigning Wimbledon champion [[Maud Watson]] in the final, losing 8 &ndash; 6, 7 &ndash; 5. Dod would win the doubles event (with Annie) and had earlier won the singles, doubles and mixed doubles at the Waterloo tournament. These performances earned her the nickname "Little Wonder" in the press. 

Slowly, Dod became an established top player, illustrated by the fact she partnered then seven-time Wimbledon doubles winner [[Ernest Renshaw]] for the first time in [[1887 in sports|1887]]. That same year, she also debuted at Wimbledon. Only six competitors, not including top player Watson, entered. Dod easily advanced through the first rounds to earn the right to challenge the defending champion<sup>[[Lottie Dod#Notes|1]]</sup>, [[Blanche Bingley]], whom she defeated 6&ndash;2, 6&ndash;0. 

The two would meet again in the final of the [[1888 in sports|1888]] West of England Tournament. Although designated as a so-called "open" tournament, the officials made the remarkable decision to impose a handicap of 15<sup>[[Lottie Dod#Notes|2]]</sup> on Dod. She still managed to win against her opponent, now known by her married name, Blanche Hillyard. The Wimbledon final of 1888 was rematch of the previous year, and Dod again emerged victorious (6&ndash;3, 6&ndash;3).

Lottie Dod's style of play, then regarded as unorthodox, now seems notably modern. She was perhaps the first player to advocate hitting the ball just before the top of the bounce and to adopt a modern, albeit single-handed, racquet grip. Her ground strokes were reported by contemporaries to be unusually firmly hit by the standards of the time, but she only rarely employed spin.

Dod only entered one open tournament in [[1889 in sports|1889]] (the Northern Championships, which she won), and failed to attend Wimbledon, much to the disappointment of her fans. Together with Annie and some friends, she was on a sailing trip off the [[Scotland|Scottish]] coast, and didn't want to return in time for Wimbledon. This was followed by a complete absence from the game in [[1890 in sports|1890]].

After failing to do so in 1889, Dod was determined to win Wimbledon three times in a row, starting in [[1891 in sports|1891]]. Although it was her only competitive appearance of that season, she won her third Wimbledon title with ease, again by defeating Hillyard (6&ndash;2, 6&ndash;1). 

[[1892 in sports|1892]] saw Dod's first singles defeat in an open tournament since [[1886 in sports|1886]], losing to [[Louise Martin]] of [[Ireland]] in the Irish Championships. It was the last of only five losses in her entire tennis career. She continued the year strongly, culminating in another easy Wimbledon victory over Hillyard.

Dod's last tennis season as a competitive player was [[1893 in sports|1893]], and she played in just two tournaments, winning both. On both occasions, she defeated Blanche Hillyard in three sets, despite a heavy fall in the Wimbledon final. Her record of five Wimbledon titles would not last for long, as Hillyard, after losing in the final to Dod five times, won her sixth title in [[1900 in sports|1900]]. [[Suzanne Lenglen]] broke Dod's record of three consecutive singles wins by winning from [[1919 in sports|1919]] to [[1923 in sports|1923]]. 

Apart from entering women's tournaments, Dod sometimes also played and won matches against men (who usually played with a handicap), and on one occasion defeated star players Ernest Renshaw and [[George Hillyard]] (the husband of Blanche) when doubling with [[Herbert Baddeley]].

== Winter sports ==

Although tennis would remain Dod's favourite sport, she shifted her attention to other activities in the following years. In 1895, she joined her brother Tony on a trip to the winter sports resort of [[Sankt Moritz]], which was very popular with English travellers. There, she passed the St. Moritz Ladies's Skating Test ([[figure skating]]), the most prestigious skating for women at the time. Dod also rode the [[toboggan]] on the famous Sankt Moritz [[Cresta Run]], and began [[mountaineering]] with her brother, climbing two mountains over 4,000 [[metre|m]] in February 1896.

After a long [[cycling]] trip in [[Italy]], Lottie and Tony returned to England, only to come back to St Moritz in November, now accompanied by their mother and brother Willy. This time, Dod took the St. Moritz Men's Skating Test and passed, as the second woman ever. She also competed in [[curling]]. In the summer of 1897, she and Tony again ascended several mountains, this time in [[Norway]].

== Field hockey ==

The sport of women's hockey was still rather young when Dod took up the game in [[1897 in sports|1897]]. She was one of the founding members of a women's hockey club in [[Spital]]. Playing as a central forward, she was soon named captain of the team. Club matches in which Dod played were won, while losses happened only in her absence. 

By [[1899 in sports|1899]], Dod had made it to captain of the Cheshire [[County palatine|county]] team, and represented her club at meetings of the women's hockey association for the northern counties. She first played in the English national team on [[21 March]] that year, winning 3&ndash;1 over Ireland. 

Both English goals in the [[1900 in sports|1900]] England and Ireland rematch were scored by Dod, securing a 2&ndash;1 victory. Dod failed to attend the match against [[Wales]], suffering from [[sciatica]] attacks which kept her from sporting for months. 

Although she had recovered by [[1901 in sports|1901]], Dod would not play again in national or county matches. All members of the Dod family stopped attending sports events for a while after their mother died on [[1 August]] [[1901]], and Dod apparently lost her interest in field hockey during that period, although she did occasionally play for Spital Club until [[1905 in sports|1905]].

== Golf ==

Few golf clubs allowed women to play around the time Lottie Dod first played golf at age fifteen. Unlike tennis, Dod found golf a difficult sport to master. By the time she got seriously interested in the sport, the [[Ladies Golf Union]] (LGU) had been founded, and women's golf had become a real sport.

Dod helped establish a ladies' golf club at [[Moreton]] in [[1894 in sports|1894]] and entered that year's National Championships ([[matchplay]]) at Littlestone ([[Kent]]). She was eliminated in the third round, but Dod's interest in the sport grew, and she became a regular competitor in the National Championships and other tournaments for the next few years. In [[1898 in sports|1898]] and [[1900 in sports|1900]] she reached the semi-finals of the National Championships, but was defeated narrowly both times. In 1900, she also played in an unofficial country match against Ireland, which the English won 37&ndash;18.

Dod did not compete in golf in [[1901 in sports|1901]], and hardly entered major tournaments in the next two years, but she did play in the [[1904 in sports|1904]] National Championships, held at [[Royal Troon Golf Club|Troon]]. She qualified for the semi-finals for the third time in her life, and won it for the first time. Her opponent in the final was [[May Hezlet]], the champion of 1899 and 1902. The match was very close, and the two were tied after 17 holes. Hezlet missed her [[putting|putt]] on the final hole narrowly, after which Dod grabbed an unexpected victory, becoming the first, and to date only, woman to win British tennis and golf championships.

Following her victory, Dod sailed to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], where she had been invited by [[Frances Griscom]], a former American golf champion, to attend the American Ladies Championship as a spectator. Upon arrival, Dod found out the tournament regulations had been changed to allow for non-Americans to compete, and she was requested to compete. Her loss in the first round was a disappointment, but Dod persuaded several Americans to come and play in the British championships the following year. 

In the week before these [[1905 in sports|1905]] championships, three international matches were planned, starting off with the first British-American international match. Dod was the only British player to lose a match, as the United Kingdom won 6&ndash;1. Dod then played for the English team in a 3&ndash;4 defeat against Scotland and a 4&ndash;3 win over Ireland, although she lost both her matches. Dod was then eliminated in the fourth round of the National Championships. It was to be her last appearance in golf.

== Archery ==

In the autumn of 1905, Dod and her brothers sold "Edgeworth" and moved to a new home near [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]], [[Berkshire]]. They had been practising archery from the times before, but all three became more serious now and joined the Welford Park Archers in Newbury. As one of their ancestors was said to have commanded the English [[longbow]]men at the [[Battle of Agincourt]], they found this an appropriate sport.

Lottie Dod won her first tournament by [[1906 in sports|1906]], and finished fifth in the Grand National Archery Meeting of 1906, [[1907 in sports|1907]] and [[1908 in sports|1908]]. Dod's performances in the 1908 season earned her a spot on the British Olympic team. The field in the women's archery event consisted only of British women, but without the best archer of the era, [[Alice Legh]]. Dod led the competition, held in rainy conditions, after the first day but was surpassed by [[Queenie Newall]] on the second day, eventually taking second place with 642 points to Newall's 688. Her brother Willy fared better and surprisingly secured the gold medal in the men's competition.

In [[1910 in sports|1910]], Dod came close to winning the Grand National, which would have made archery the third sport in which she became a national champion. Both Lottie and her brother William led after day one, but moved down to second on the final competition day. After the Welford Archers were disbanded in late [[1911 in sports|1911]], the Dods's interest in archery faded, meaning the end of Lottie Dod's long competitive sports career.

== Later life ==

In 1913, Willy and Lottie moved to a new house in [[Bideford]] (Tony had married in the meantime). When [[World War I]] broke out, Willy enlisted with the [[Royal Fusiliers]], while his sister worked for the [[Red Cross]] in a military hospital in [[Speen]]. 

Dod wanted to be transferred to the war zones in [[France]] but was hampered by [[sciatica]] and never served as a nurse outside England. She did receive a Service Medal by the Red Cross for serving more than 1,000 hours during the war. 

She then lived in [[London]] and [[Devon]], and she never failed to attend the Wimbledon Championships until she was in her late eighties. After her brother Willy died in 1954, she lived in several nursing homes on the English south coast, eventually settling at the Birchy Hill Nursing Home in [[Sway (town)|Sway]]. There she died, unmarried, at age 88, passing away while listening to the Wimbledon radio broadcasts in bed.

Dod was elected to the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in [[1983 in sports|1983]].

== Notes ==

# At the time, many tournaments were played in a format in which the final saw the defending champion facing a challenger, the player who had won all matches in preliminary play.
# Handicap tournaments were common at the time. In an attempt to even out the games, stronger players were given a penalty of one or more points. Handicap events were common in virtually all sports in the late 19th and early 20th century, but are nowadays only commonly found in golf.
