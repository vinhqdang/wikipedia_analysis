Colbert's performance consisted of a 16-minute podium speech and a 7-minute video presentation, which were broadcast live across the [[United States]] on cable television networks [[C-SPAN]] and [[MSNBC]].

==Performance at the dinner==
[[Image:Colbert Dinner.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Stephen Colbert telling jokes several feet away from George W. Bush at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Dinner]]
Colbert was invited to speak at the dinner by [[Mark Smith (AP radio)|Mark Smith]], outgoing president of the White House Press Corps Association. According to a report in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, "Smith later told the ''[[The New York Times|Times]]'' he hadn't seen much of Colbert's work."<ref>

Colbert gave his after-dinner remarks in front of an audience that the [[Associated Press]] described as a "Who's Who of power and celebrity".<ref name="ap-2006.04.30"/> More than 2,500 guests attended the event,<ref name="nytimes-bush-twins"/><ref name="onethemedia-guess-who"/> including [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Laura Bush]], [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] [[Peter Pace]], [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] [[Alberto Gonzales]], [[AOL]] co-founder [[Steve Case]], tennis star [[Anna Kournikova]], and actor [[George Clooney]].<ref name="washpost-all-georges"/><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/24/AR2006042401951.html | title=Our Favorite Dish: Correspondents' Dinner Invites | first=Amy | last=Argetsinger | coauthors=Roxanne Roberts | publisher=[[The Washington Post]] | date=[[April 25]], [[2006]], accessdate = 2006-11-11}}</ref> For his performance, Colbert took on the role of the character that he plays on his television show, ''The Colbert Report''. He spoke directly to President Bush several times, [[satire|satirically]] praising his [[American foreign policy|foreign policy]], lifestyle, and beliefs, and referring to his then-declining [[approval rating]] and popular reputation.

Many of Colbert's jokes were directed at President Bush, while other jokes lampooned the journalists and other figures present at the dinner. Although most of the speech was prepared specifically for the event, several segments were lifted, largely unchanged, from ''The Colbert Report'', particularly from the opening "[[truthiness]]" monologue on the first episode of the show, where Colbert advocated speaking from "the gut" rather than the brain, and denounced books as "all fact, no heart." Colbert framed this part of the speech as though he were agreeing with Bush's own philosophies, saying that he and Bush are "not brainiacs on the nerd patrol,"<ref name="improved transcript">{{cite web|url=http://dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/4/30/1441/59811|accessdate=2006-05-07|title=Daily Kos: Re-Improved Colbert Transcript|date=[[2006-04-30]]|publisher=[[Daily Kos]]}}</ref> thus implicitly criticizing the way Bush positions himself as an [[anti-intellectualism|anti-intellectual]].

Following this introduction to his style and general philosophy, Colbert listed a series of absurd "beliefs that I live by," such as "I believe in America. I believe it exists." He also alluded to [[outsourcing]] to China, and satirized the traditional [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opposition to "[[big government]]" by referencing the [[Iraq War]], saying, "I believe the government that governs best is the government that governs least. And by these standards, we have set up a fabulous government in Iraq."<ref name="improved transcript" />

Colbert then segued into a segment poking fun at Bush's then-sinking [[approval rating]]s:

:"Now, I know there are some polls out there saying this man has a 32 percent approval rating. But guys like us, we don't pay attention to the polls. We know that polls are just a collection of statistics that reflect what people are thinking in 'reality.' And reality has a well-known liberal bias. ... Sir, pay no attention to the people who say [[is the glass half empty or half full?|the glass is half empty]], because 32% means it's two-thirds empty. There's still some liquid in that glass, is my point. But I wouldn't drink it. The last third is usually [[saliva|backwash]]."<ref name="improved transcript" />

Following this, Colbert continued his mock defense of Bush by satirizing Bush's [[photo op]]s aboard the [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|USS ''Abraham Lincoln'']],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/10/29/iraq/main580661.shtml|publisher=[[CBS News]]|title='Mission Accomplished' Whodunit|date=[[October 29]] [[2003]]|accessdate = 2006-06-01}}</ref> at the site of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|collapsed World Trade Center]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/custom/attack/ny-bushgallery15,0,6997742.photogallery?coll=bal-attack-utility|publisher=[[Baltimore Sun]]|title=Bush Visits Rescuers at Ground Zero|date=[[September 14]] [[2001]]|accessdate = 2006-05-31|author=[[Associated Press|AP]] Photo}}</ref> and in cities devastated by [[Hurricane Katrina]]:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Allegations_President_Bush_staged_photo-ops_in_aftermath_of_Hurricane_Katrina_tragedy|publisher=[[Wikinews]]|title=Allegations President Bush staged photo-ops in aftermath of Hurricane Katrina tragedy|date=[[September 6]] [[2005]]|accessdate = 2006-06-01}}</ref>

:"I stand by this man. I stand by this man because he stands for things. Not only ''for'' things, he stands ''on'' things. Things like aircraft carriers, and rubble, and recently flooded city squares. And that sends a strong message: that no matter what happens to America, she will always rebound<U+2014>with the most powerfully staged photo ops in the world."<ref name="improved transcript" />

Colbert then wrapped up the portion of his monologue specifically directed at Bush by parodying his [[energy policy of the United States|energy policy]], using Laura Bush's reading initiative as a springboard to mock-criticize books for being "[[elitist]]," and complimenting Bush for being "steady": "Events can change; this man's beliefs never will."<ref name="improved transcript" /> 

Next, Colbert took time to harshly criticize the [[White House Press Corps]], who hosted the event, and the [[media bias in the United States|media]] in general. Addressing the audience, he remarked:

:"Over the last five years, you people were so good<U+2014>over [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001|tax cuts]], [[weapons of mass destruction|WMD]] intelligence, the effect of [[global warming]]. We Americans didn't want to know, and you had the courtesy not to try to find out. ... And then you write, 'Oh, they're just rearranging the deck chairs on the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]''.' First of all, that is a ''terrible'' metaphor. This administration is not sinking. This administration is ''soaring''. If anything, they are rearranging the deck chairs on the ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]''!"<ref name="improved transcript" />

For the remainder of his speech, Colbert joked about a number of people in the audience, including Peter Pace, [[Antonin Scalia]], [[John McCain]], and [[Joseph C. Wilson|Joe Wilson]]. During this section, he made another reference to global warming while talking about interviewing [[Jesse Jackson]]: "You can ask him anything, but he's going to say what he wants, at the pace that he wants. It's like boxing a glacier. Enjoy that metaphor, by the way, because your grandchildren will have no idea what a glacier is."

Colbert received a chilly reception from the audience.<ref name="onethemedia-guess-who"/> His jokes were often met with awkward silence and muttering, apart from the enthusiastic laughter of a few in the audience, such as Antonin Scalia's hearty laughter as Colbert teased him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2140921/nav/tap2|first=Tray|last=Patterson|title=Dinner Theater: Why Stephen Colbert didn't bomb in D.C.|publisher=[[Slate]]|date=[[May 2]] [[2006]]|accessdate = 2007-01-30}}</ref> This was in stark contrast to the warm reception that Bush received at the event for his skit with [[look-alike|impersonator]] [[Steve Bridges]], which immediately preceded Colbert's monologue.<ref name="editor-and-publisher-2006.04.29"/><ref name="nytimes-truthiness-bums"/>

At the end of his monologue, Colbert introduced what he characterized as an audition video to become the new [[White House Press Secretary]] ([[Scott McClellan]] having recently left the position). The video spliced clips of difficult questions from the White House press corps with responses from Colbert as Press Secretary. Colbert's podium included controls marked "eject," "Gannon" (a reference to erstwhile White House reporter [[Jeff Gannon]], who once asked Bush a question that some in the press corps considered "so friendly it might have been planted"<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Editor and Publisher |title=Congresswoman Asks for Probe After 'Gannon' Quits WH Reporting Post |date=2005-02-09}}</ref>), and "volume," which he used to silence a critical question by [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]].

The video continued with Colbert fleeing the briefing room and the White House, only to be pursued by [[Helen Thomas]], who has been a vocal critic of the Bush administration.<ref>Eisele, Albert; Jeff Dufour, [http://www.hillnews.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/UndertheDome/072805.html Under the Dome] ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', [[July 28]] [[2005]].

URL accessed on [[June 6]] [[2006]].</ref> The footage of Thomas' pursuit of Colbert is not spliced, as Thomas had agreed to participate in the video. At one point, Colbert picks up an emergency phone and explains that Thomas "won't stop asking why we invaded Iraq." The dispatcher responds with, "Hey, why ''did'' we invade Iraq?" The entire second half of the video is a spoof of [[horror film]] [[clich<U+00E9>]]s, particularly the film ''[[Westworld]]'', with melodramatic music accompanying Thomas's slow, unwavering pursuit of Colbert, and Colbert loudly screaming "No!" at various intervals.

Several of Bush's aides and supporters walked out during Colbert's speech, and one former aide commented that the President had "that look that he's ready to blow."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060501/1whwatch.htm|date=[[2006-05-01]]|publisher=[[U.S. News & World Report]]|accessdate = 2006-05-08|title=Skewering comedy skit angers Bush and aides|first=Paul|last=Bedard}}</ref> Although President Bush shook Colbert's hand after his presentation, Colbert received an icy response from First Lady Laura Bush.<ref name="onethemedia-guess-who">{{cite news|url=http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/transcripts_050506_dinner.html|title=Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=[[May 5]] [[2006]]|accessdate = 2006-06-03}}</ref><ref name="editor-and-publisher-2006.04.29">{{cite news|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002425363|publisher=[[Editor and Publisher]]|title=Colbert Lampoons Bush at White House Correspondents Dinner -- President Not Amused?|author=E&P Staff|date=[[April 29]] [[2006]]|accessdate = 2006-05-07}} ([http://www.banderasnews.com/0605/wr-colbert.htm archived version])</ref>

Much of the initial coverage of the Correspondents Dinner contrasted the audience's very positive reaction to President Bush's comedy routine with actor Steve Bridges ("The president killed.

On his show, Colbert joked that the unenthusiastic reception was actually "very respectful silence" and added that the crowd "practically carried me out on their shoulders" even though he wasn't ready to leave.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/01/AR2006050101558.html|title=Colbert, Still Digesting His Correspondents' Dinner Reception|first=Lisa|last=De Moraes|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|date=[[May 2]] [[2006]]|accessdate = 2006-11-21}}</ref>

==Allegations of a media blackout==
Among some commentators, the popularity of Colbert's dinner speech was mixed with indignation at the press corps for, as they saw it, snubbing Colbert<ref name="dailykos-2006.04.30">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/4/30/145840/197|title=The Colbert Reports|publisher=[[Daily Kos]]|date=[[April 30]] [[2006]]|accessdate = 2006-06-03}}</ref><ref name="crooksandliars-2006-04-29"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-daou/ignoring-colbert-a-small_b_20092.html|title=Ignoring Colbert: A Small Taste of the Media's Power to Choose the News|first=Peter|last=Daou|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=[[April 30]] [[2006]]|accessdate = 2006-06-03}}</ref> even though he was the featured entertainer for the evening.<ref name="ap-2006.04.30" /> ''The Washington Post'' columnist [[Dan Froomkin]] called it "The Colbert Blackout" and lambasted the traditional media for ignoring Colbert and instead focusing on the "much safer" routine where President Bush was joined onstage by a Bush impersonator.<ref name="blackout">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2006/05/02/BL2006050200755.html  | publisher=[[Washington Post]] | title=The Colbert Blackout | first=Dan | last=Froomkin | authorlink=Dan Froomkin | date=[[May 2]], [[2006]] | accessdate=2006-05-07}}</ref> [[Media Matters for America|Media Matters]] was especially critical of television news. They reported that ABC's ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'', NBC's ''Sunday Today'', the ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'', the morning shows of the three major networks, and CNN's ''[[American Morning]]'' all focused on Bush's skit and "ignored Colbert entirely."<ref name="media-matters-2006.05.01" /> Media Matters also contrasted various news outlets' failure to cover Colbert to the extensive coverage that [[Don Imus]] drew for his controversial insults at [[Bill Clinton]] at the 1996 [[Radio and Television Correspondents' Association]] Dinner.<ref name="media-matters-2006.05.01" /> [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]] professor [[Todd Gitlin]] remarked, "It's too hot to handle. [Colbert] was scathing toward Bush and it was absolutely devastating.

However, others saw no intentional snub of Colbert by the press. Responding to a question about why ''The Washington Post'''s article about the dinner "did not convey with any specificity what Colbert had to say," Media Backtalk writer [[Howard Kurtz]] responded, "The problem in part is one of deadline. The presses were already rolling by the time Colbert came on at 10:30, so the story had to be largely written by then."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2006/04/28/DI2006042800882.html | publisher=[[The Washington Post]] | title=Media Backtalk | first=Howard | last=Kurtz | authorlink=Howard Kurtz | date=[[May 1]], [[2006]] | accessdate=2006-05-08}}</ref> Asked why television news favored Bush<U+2019>s performance over Colbert's, [[Elizabeth Fishman]], an assistant dean at the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism|Columbia School of Journalism]] and a former ''[[60 Minutes]]'' producer, told [[MTV]] that the "quick hit" for television news shows would have been to use footage of Bush standing beside his impersonator. "It's an easier set up for visual effect," she noted.<ref name="nocomment" /> [[Steve Scully]], president of the White House Correspondents' Association (which hosted the dinner) and political editor of C-SPAN (which broadcasted the dinner), scoffed at the whole idea of the press intentionally ignoring Colbert: "Bush hit such a home run with Steve Bridges that he got all of the coverage. I think that exceeded expectations. There was no right-wing conspiracy or left-wing conspiracy."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002426252|accessdate=2006-05-07|publisher=[[Editor and Publisher]]|title=WH Correspondents Dinner Planners Brush Off Criticism|first=Joe|last=Strupp}}</ref> ''Time'' columnist [[Ana Marie Cox]] called the allegations of a deliberate [[media blackout]] a "fake controversy" because Colbert's performance got coverage in ''The New York Times'', ''The Washington Post'', and the major wire services.<ref name="timefun">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1191093,00.html|accessdate=2006-05-09|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|title=Was Stephen Colbert Funny?|author=[[Ana Marie Cox|Cox, Ana Marie]]}}</ref> Fellow commentator Kurtz concurred, noting that not only was the video carried on C-SPAN and freely available online but, also, he himself had played two clips on his own CNN show, "so apparently I didn't get the memo."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2006/05/02/BL2006050200424.html | publisher=[[The Washington Post]] | title=Punchline Politics | first=Howard | last=Kurtz | authorlink=Howard Kurtz | date=[[May 2]], [[2006]] | accessdate=2006-04-08}}</ref>

On [[May 3]], [[2006]], ''The New York Times'' published an article addressing the controversy. The paper acknowledged that some had "chided the so-called mainstream media, including ''The Times'', which ignored Mr. Colbert's remarks while writing about [Bush's] opening act."<ref name="Colbert chatter">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/03/arts/03colb.html|date=[[2006-05-03]]|accessdate=2006-05-07|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|first=Jacques|last=Steinberg|title=After Press Dinner, the Blogosphere Is Alive With the Sound of Colbert Chatter}}</ref> ''The Times'' then quoted several passages of Colbert's more substantial criticism of the president and covered various reactions to the event. On [[May 15]], ''The Times''' Public Editor, [[Byron Calame]], wrote on his blog that more than two hundred readers had written to complain about the exclusion of any mention of Colbert from the initial, lengthy article covering the dinner. Calame quoted ''The New York Times''<nowiki>'</nowiki> deputy bureau chief in Washington, who said that a mention of Colbert in the first article could not have been long enough to do his routine justice, but also that the paper should have printed a distinct in-depth article on Colbert at the same time, rather than days after the fact.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=59|accessdate=2006-05-22|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|first=Byron|last=Calame|title=Why No Stephen Colbert}}</ref>

==Praise and criticism for Colbert==
Colbert's performance found a wide variation of positive and negative reactions from the media. [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] News Online columnist [[Heather Mallick]] wrote, "Colbert had the wit and raw courage to do to Bush what [[Mark Antony]] did to [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]], murderer of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]. As the American media has self-destructed, it takes Colbert to damn Bush with devastatingly [[Irony#Roman irony|ironic]] praise."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp_mallick/20060505.html|title=Did you hear the one about the satirist and the president?

However, the Washington press corps felt that Colbert had bombed.<ref name="nytimes-truthiness-bums"/> ''Washington Post'' columnist [[Richard Cohen (journalist)|Richard Cohen]] found that Colbert's jokes were "lame and insulting" <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/03/AR2006050302202.html|date=[[2006-05-03]]|accessdate=2006-05-07|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|author=[[Richard Cohen (journalist)|Cohen, Richard]]|title=So Not Funny}}</ref> and wrote that Colbert was "rude" and a "bully." [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|Whip]] [[Steny Hoyer]] felt that Colbert "crossed the line." Hoyer told the newspaper ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', "[Bush] is the President of the United States, and he deserves some respect."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hillnews.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/050306/hoyer.html|date=[[2006-05-03]]|accessdate=2006-05-07|publisher=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|title=Hoyer: Bush Deserves Respect|first=Andrew|last=Barr|coauthors=Josephine Hearn}}</ref> Right-wing pundit [[Mary Matalin]] called Colbert's performance a "predictable, Bush-bashing kind of humor."<ref name="Colbert chatter" /> [[Ana Marie Cox]] chastised those who praised Colbert as a hero: "I somehow doubt that Bush has never heard these criticisms before." She added, "Comedy can have a political point but it is not political action."<ref name="timefun" />

On his [[The Daily Show|television program]], Jon Stewart remarked, "apparently [Colbert] was under the impression that they'd hired him to do what he does every night on television."<ref name="EPstewart" /><ref name="dailyshow" /> Attorney and columnist [[Julie Hilden]] concluded that Colbert's "vituperative parody" might have been unfair under different circumstances, but that Bush's record of controlling potential criticism created a heightened justification for others to criticize him when they could get the chance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/hilden/20060509.html|date=[[2006-05-09]]|accessdate=2006-05-10|publisher=[[Writ (website)|Writ]]|title=Did Stephen Colbert Cross a Free Speech Line at the White House Correspondents' Dinner?

[[Media Matters for America|Media Matters]] and ''[[Editor & Publisher]]'' came to Colbert's defense, calling his critics hypocrites.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://mediamatters.org/items/200605040007|date=[[2006-05-04]]|accessdate=2006-05-07|publisher=[[Media Matters for America|Media Matters]]|title=Cohen called Colbert "a bully" for his "rude" and "insulting" correspondents dinner routine|first=Julie|last=Millican}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/columns/pressingissues_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002426015|accessdate=2006-05-07|publisher=[[Editor and Publisher]]|author=[[Greg Mitchell|Mitchell, Greg]]|title=When the President Joked About Not Finding WMD}}</ref> They contrasted the critical reaction to Colbert to the praise that many in the press had for a controversial routine that Bush performed at a similar media dinner in 2004, where Bush was shown looking for [[Weapons of mass destruction|WMDs]] in the [[Oval Office]] and joking, "Those weapons of mass destruction must be somewhere!" and "Nope, no weapons over there!"

''The New York Times'' published five letters to the editor on Colbert's performance in its [[May 3]] and [[May 4]] editions &mdash; all of which were strongly supportive of Colbert, and some of which were critical of ''The New York Times'' for reporting only critical reactions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/03/opinion/l03colbert.html|accessdate=2006-05-07|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|title=Truthiness and Power (2 Letters)|date=[[2006-05-03]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/04/opinion/l04colbert.html|accessdate=2006-05-07|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|title=The Acid Humor of Stephen Colbert (4 Letters)|date=[[2006-05-04]]}}</ref>

[[Arianna Huffington]] reported that Colbert told her he had "strenuously avoided reading anything about his appearance," and personally remained unaware of public reactions to it. Colbert's wife, Evelyn, said she was considering tracking down and saving references from publications and blogs so that Colbert could read something about the public reaction if he chose to at a later time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/is-stephen-colbert-the-la_b_20774.html|accessdate=2006-05-24|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|title=Is Stephen Colbert the Last One to Know How Amazing He Was?|date=[[2006-05-11]]|authorlink=Arianna Huffington|first=Arianna|last=Huffington}}</ref>

Stephen Colbert won an award at [[VH1]]'s [[Big in '06]] Awards. During the footage of comedians commenting on Colbert's success, they showed a clip from his 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner speech.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}
