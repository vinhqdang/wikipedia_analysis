'''Sheffield''' is a major [[city status in the United Kingdom|city]] and [[metropolitan borough]] in the [[Northern England|north of]] [[England]]. It is so named because of its origins in a field on the [[River Sheaf]] that runs through the city. The city has grown from its largely industrial roots to encompass a wide economic base. The population of the City of Sheffield is estimated at 520,700 people (2005),<ref>The mid-2005 population estimate for the City of Sheffield was 520,700 according to the [http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=9394&More=Y Office for National Statistics]. It should be noted that this figure includes the whole area included in the city. Some population figures, for example those given at [[List of English cities by population]] use just the urban core of the city and therefore are lower. The [http://www.sheffield.nhs.uk/healthdata/4-1.php Neighbourhood profiles] given by the Sheffield Health Authority estimates the figure at 542,716.</ref> and it is one of the eight largest [[England#Geography|English]] cities outside [[London]] that form the [[English Core Cities Group]].

The city became world famous in the nineteenth century for its production of [[steel]]. Many innovations in the industry were developed locally, including [[crucible steel|crucible]] and [[stainless steel]]. This fuelled an almost tenfold increase in the population during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. It gained its [[Municipal charter|city charter]] in 1893 and became officially titled the City of Sheffield. International competition caused a decline in local industry during the 1970s and 1980s, and at the same time the national coal industry collapsed, affecting Sheffield's population. In recent years the city has reinvented itself as a sporting and technology city.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Sheffield}}
Sheffield is located at {{coor dm|53|23|N|1|28|W|type:city_region:GB}}. It lies directly beside [[Rotherham]], from which it is separated by the [[M1 motorway (England)|M1 motorway]]. Although [[Barnsley (borough)|Barnsley Metropolitan Borough]] also borders Sheffield to the north, the town itself is a few miles further. The southern and western borders of the city are shared with [[Derbyshire]]; in the first half of the 20th century Sheffield extended its borders south into Derbyshire, annexing a number of villages.<ref name="derbyshire_expansion">J. G. Harston (2005) [http://www.mdfs.net/Docs/Sheffield/Borders/ ''The borders of Sheffield from 1843 to 1994'']'' (Accessed [[28 December]] [[2005]])</ref> Directly to the west of the city is the [[Peak District National Park]] and the [[Pennines|Pennine]] hill range.

Sheffield is a geographically diverse city.<ref name="GEO_diverse">"[http://www.map21ltd.com/COSTC11/sheffield-case.htm Case Study<U+2014>Sheffield, UK]". ''Greenstructures and Urban Planning''. (Accessed [[26 September]] [[2005]])</ref> The city nestles in a natural amphitheatre created by several hills<ref name="number of hills">It is often stated that Sheffield is built on seven hills, and residents are fond of adding 'like Rome' (for an example see Sheffield Hallam University's [http://www.shu.ac.uk/sheffield/ guide to the city for new students]). However, [http://www.mdfs.net/Docs/Sheffield/Hills/ a study by J.G.Harston] found there to be eight.</ref> and the confluence of five rivers: [[River Don, England|Don]], [[River Sheaf|Sheaf]], [[River Rivelin|Rivelin]], [[River Loxley|Loxley]] and [[Porter Brook|Porter]]. As such, much of the city is built on hillsides with views into the city centre or out to the countryside. The city's lowest point is just 10&nbsp;m above sea level, while some parts of the city are at over 500&nbsp;metres (1,640&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]). However, 89% of the housing in the city is between 100 and 200 metres (330&nbsp;&&nbsp;660&nbsp;ft) above sea level.

With an estimated total of over two million trees,<ref name="GEO_treecount">{{cite web | author = Sheffield City Council | title = Trees & Woodlands in Sheffield | date = 2006-07-03 | url = http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/out--about/parks-woodlands--countryside/trees--woodlands | accessdate = 2006-08-11 }}</ref> Sheffield has more trees per person than any other city in Europe. It has over 170 woodlands (covering 28.27&nbsp;km<U+00B2>&nbsp;/&nbsp;10.9&nbsp;mi<U+00B2>), 78 public parks (covering 18.30&nbsp;km<U+00B2>&nbsp;/&nbsp;7.1&nbsp;mi<U+00B2>) and 10 public gardens. Added to the 134.66&nbsp;km<U+00B2> (52&nbsp;[[square mile|mi<U+00B2>]]) of national park and 10.87&nbsp;km<U+00B2> (4.2&nbsp;mi<U+00B2>) of water this means that 61% of the city is [[greenspace]].

Sheffield also has a very wide variety of [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]], comparing favourably with any city in the [[United Kingdom]]: urban, parkland and woodland, agricultural and arable land, moors, meadows and freshwater-based habitats. Large parts of the city are designated as [[SSSI|sites of special scientific interest]] including several urban areas.

The present city boundaries were set in 1974, when the former [[county borough]] of Sheffield merged with [[Stocksbridge]] [[Urban District]] and two parishes from the [[Wortley Rural District]]. This area includes a significant part of the countryside surrounding the main urban region. Roughly a third of Sheffield lies in the [[Peak District National Park]] (no other English city includes parts of a [[national park]] within its boundary), and Sheffield is officially Europe's greenest city, having won the 2005 [[Entente Florale]] competition. This was helped by the fact that Sheffield contains over 150 [[woodland]] spaces and 50 public [[park]]s.<ref name="SCCFACTS">[http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/facts-figures Facts and Figures] (Accessed [[27 December]] [[2005]])</ref>

===People===

People from Sheffield are called Sheffielders. They are also colloquially known to people in the surrounding towns of Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham and Chesterfield as "dee-dars" (which derives from their pronunciation of the "th" in the dialectal words "thee" and "thou").<ref name="deedar">Alexander, Don (2001).

At the time of the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 UK census]], the ethnic make-up of Sheffield's population was 91.2% White, 4.6% Asian, 1.6 mixed and 1.8% Black. Sheffield also has large [[Poland|Polish]], [[Somalia|Somali]], [[Slovakia|Slovak]], [[Yemen|Yemeni]] and [[Kosovo|Kosovar]] populations. In terms of religion, 68.6% of the population are [[Christian]] and 4.6% [[Muslim]]. Other religions represent less than 1% each. The number of people without a religion is above the national average at 17.9%, with 7.8% not stating their religion.<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/00cg.asp Sheffield profile] (Accessed [[21 December]] [[2005]])</ref> The largest quinary group is 20- to 24-year-olds (9.2%), mainly because of the large university population (45,000+).<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/STATBASE/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=9090 Mid-2004 population estimates].

===Districts===
:''Main article: [[Districts of Sheffield]]''

Sheffield is made up of numerous districts that vary widely in size and history. Many of these districts developed from villages or [[hamlet (place)|hamlets]] that were absorbed into Sheffield as the city grew The districts are largely ignored by the administrative and political divisions of the city; instead it is divided into 28 electoral [[ward (politics)|ward]]s,<ref>[http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/your-city-council/elections/ward-boundaries Sheffield's Ward Boundaries]. ''Sheffield City Council website'' (Accessed [[29 December]] [[2005]])</ref> with each ward generally covering 4&ndash;6 districts. The electoral wards are grouped into six [[United Kingdom constituencies|parliamentary constituencies]], although because of a different review cycle, the ward and constituency boundaries are currently not all conterminous. Sheffield is largely [[civil parish|unparished]], but [[Bradfield, South Yorkshire|Bradfield]] and [[Ecclesfield]] have parish councils, and [[Stocksbridge]] has a town council.

==History==
:''Main article: [[History of Sheffield]]''

The area that is now the City of Sheffield has been occupied since at least the last [[ice age]],<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/4476303.stm Experts put date to UK rock art]. ''BBC News''. (Accessed [[27 December]] [[2005]]).</ref> but the settlements that grew to form Sheffield date from the second half of the 1st millennium, and are of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Danelaw|Danish]] origin.<ref name="VICKERS">Vickers, J. Edward MBE (1999). ''Old Sheffield Town. An Historical Miscellany'' (2nd ed.). Sheffield: The Hallamshire Press Limited. ISBN 1-874718-44-X.</ref> In Anglo-Saxon times the Sheffield area straddled the border between the kingdoms of [[Mercia]] and [[Northumbria]]. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' reports that [[Eanred of Northumbria|King Eanred]] of [[Northumbria]] submitted to [[Egbert of Wessex|King Egbert]] of [[Wessex]] at the hamlet of [[Dore]] (now a suburb of Sheffield) in 829.<ref>In an entry dated 827 the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] states "Egbert led an army against the Northumbrians as far as Dore, where they met him, and offered terms of obedience and subjection, on the acceptance of which they returned home" ([http://omacl.org/Anglo/part2.html transcription]). Most sources (for example Vickers, 1999 above) state that the date given in the chronicle is incorrect, and that 829 is the more likely date for this event.</ref> This event made Egbert the first Saxon to claim to be king of all of England. After the [[Norman conquest]], [[Sheffield Castle]] was built to control the local settlements, and a small town developed that is the nucleus of the modern city.

By 1296 a market had been established at what is now known as [[Castle Square, Sheffield|Castle Square]],<ref>[http://www.sheffieldmarkets.co.uk/sheffield-market-history.php Sheffield Market History]. ''Sheffield Markets''. (Accessed [[27 December]] [[2005]])</ref> and Sheffield subsequently grew into a small market town. In the 14th century Sheffield was already noted for the production of knives, as mentioned in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'',<ref>[[Geoffrey Chaucer]] in [[The Reeve's Prologue and Tale|The Reeve<U+2019>s Tale]] from his book ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' wrote: "Ther was no man, for peril, dorste hym touche. A Sheffeld thwitel baar he in his hose. Round was his face, and camus was his nose"</ref> and by 1600 it had become the main centre of cutlery production in England, overseen by [[Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire|The Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire]]. From 1570 to 1584 [[Mary I of Scotland|Mary, Queen of Scots]] was held as a prisoner in Sheffield Castle and [[Sheffield Manor]].<ref name="VICKERS"/>
[[Image:ChaucerPortraitEllesmereMs.jpg|thumb|250px|Portrait of Chaucer as a Canterbury pilgrim in the [[Ellesmere manuscript]] of ''The Canterbury Tales'']]

In the 1740s a form of the [[crucible steel]] process was discovered that allowed the manufacture of a better quality of [[steel]] than had previously been available. At about the same time a technique for fusing a thin sheet of [[silver]] onto a [[copper]] ingot to produce silver plating was invented and became widely known as [[Sheffield plate]]. These innovations spurred the growth of Sheffield as an industrial town. However, the loss of some important export markets led to a recession in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The resulting poor conditions culminated in a [[cholera]] epidemic that killed 402 people in 1832.<ref name="VICKERS"/> The [[industrial revolution]] saw a resurgence of Sheffield through the 19th century. As a result of its growing population, the town was incorporated as a [[borough]] in 1842 and granted a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city charter]] in 1893.<ref>[http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/your-city-council/lord-mayor/history-of-lord-mayor History of the Lord Mayor]. ''Sheffield City Council website''. (Accessed [[27 December]] [[2005]])</ref> The influx of people also led to demand for better water supplies, and a number of new reservoirs were constructed on the outskirts of the town. The collapse of the dam wall of one of these reservoirs in 1864 resulted in [[Great Sheffield Flood|the Great Sheffield Flood]], which killed 270 people and devastated large parts of the town. The growing population also led to the construction of a large number of back-to-back slums, which, along with severe pollution from the factories, inspired [[George Orwell]], writing in 1937, to declare, "Sheffield, I suppose, could justly claim to be called the ugliest town in the Old World".<ref>[[George Orwell]] (1937). ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'', chapter 7.</ref>

A recession in the 1930s was only halted by the increasing international tension as [[World War II]] loomed. The steel factories of Sheffield were set to work making weapons and ammunition for the war. As a result, once war was declared, the city became a target for bombing raids, the heaviest of which occurred over the nights of [[12 December]] and [[15 December]] [[1940]] (now known as the ''[[Sheffield Blitz]]''). More than 660 lives were lost and numerous buildings were destroyed.<ref>[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~engsheffield/blitz/blitz.htm The Story of the Sheffield Blitz.] ''Sheffield Genealogy Family & Social History'' (Accessed [[28 December]] [[2005]])</ref>

In the 1950s and 1960s, many of the slums were demolished and replaced with housing schemes such as the [[Park Hill, Sheffield|Park Hill flats]]. Large parts of the city centre were also cleared to make way for a new system of roads.<ref name="VICKERS"/> Increased automation and competition from abroad resulted in the closure of many steel mills. The 1980s saw the worst of this run-down of Sheffield's industries (along with those of many other areas in the UK), culminating in the 1984/5 [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|miners' strike]]. The building of the [[Meadowhall]] shopping centre on the site of a former steelworks in 1990 was a mixed blessing, creating much needed jobs but speeding the decline of the city centre. Attempts to regenerate the city were kick-started when the city hosted the 1991 [[Universiade|World Student Games]], which saw the construction of new sporting facilities such as the [[Sheffield Arena]], [[Don Valley Stadium]] and the [[Ponds Forge]] complex.<ref name="VICKERS"/> The city is now changing rapidly as new projects aim to regenerate run-down parts of the city. One such project, the ''Heart of the City Project'', has seen a number of public works in the city centre: the [[Sheffield Town Hall|Peace Gardens]] were renovated in 1998, the [[Millennium Galleries]] opened in April 2001, the [[Sheffield Winter Gardens|Winter Gardens]] were opened on [[22 May]] [[2003]], and a public space to link these two areas, the Millennium Square, was opened in May 2006.  In December 2006 [[Sheaf Square]] was opened, its aim to act as a 21st century gateway to the city. It contains The Cutting Edge scultpture made of Sheffield steel, which has water cascading down it and another large water feature which also pays homage to Sheffield's steel-centered past. It was opened on [[22 December]] with street entertainment and a fireworks display. A number of other projects grouped under the title [[Sheffield One]] aim to regenerate the whole of the city centre, with ambitious plans for a split-level high street shopping area due to be finalised at the end of 2006.

{{see also|Economy of Sheffield|List of hi-tech companies in Sheffield}}
After many years of decline, there are now signs that the Sheffield economy is seeing a revival. The 2004 [[Barclays Bank]] Financial Planning study<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3871857.stm Wealth hotspots 'outside London']". ''BBC News''. (Accessed [[7 July]] [[2004]])</ref> revealed that, in 2003, the Sheffield district of [[Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)|Hallam]] was the highest ranking area outside London for overall wealth, the proportion of people earning over <U+00A3>60,000 a year standing at almost 12%. A survey by Knight Frank<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/4314628.stm Sheffield 'hotbed' for investment] ''BBC News'' (Accessed [[17 October]] [[2005]])</ref> revealed that Sheffield was the fastest-growing city outside of [[London]] for office and residential space and rents during the second half of 2004. Some <U+00A3>250 million has also been invested in the city during 2005. The Sheffield economy is worth <U+00A3>7.4 billion (2003 GVA).<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_economy/NUTS3_Tables_1-12.xls Headline GVA by NUT3 area at current basic prices 1995 to 2003] Economy worth (Accessed [[22 December]] [[2005]])</ref>  This can be seen by the current surge of redevelopments, including the [[St. Pauls Tower|City Lofts Tower]] and accompanying [[St. Pauls Place]], Velocity Living, and [[the Moor]] redevelopment,<ref>[http://www.moorsheffield.com/public_consultation/MoorSheffield_boards.pdf the website shows the plans for the Moor in Sheffield]</ref> the forthcoming [[New Retail Quarter|NRQ]] and the recently completed [[Sheffield Winter Gardens|Winter Gardens]], [[Peace Gardens]], [[Millennium Galleries]], many project under the [[Sheffield One]] redevelopment agency.

Sheffield has an international reputation for metallurgy and [[steel]]-making.<ref>There are numerous sources showing the international reputation of Sheffield for metallurgy, and in particular steel and cutlery manufacture. Some examples are: the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], which begins its entry for ''Sheffield'', "The name of a manufacturing city of Yorkshire, famous for cutlery"; and the [[Encyclopaedia Britannica]], which in its entry for ''Sheffield'' states that by 1830 Sheffield had earned "recognition as the world centre of high-grade steel manufacture". David Hey in the preface to his 1997 book ''Mesters to Masters: A History of the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire.'' ([[Oxford University Press]], ISBN 0-19-828997-9) states "It (Sheffield) was known for its cutlery wares long before the incorporation of the Cutlers' Company in 1624, and long before it acquired an international reputation as the steel capital of the world."</ref> Many innovations in these fields have been made in Sheffield. [[Benjamin Huntsman]] discovered the [[crucible technique]] in the 1740s at his workshop in [[Handsworth, South Yorkshire|Handsworth]]. This process was made obsolete in 1856 by [[Henry Bessemer]]'s invention of the [[Bessemer converter]]. [[Thomas Boulsover]] invented [[Sheffield Plate]] (silver-plated copper) in the early 18th century. [[Stainless steel]] was invented by [[Harry Brearley]] in 1912, and the work of [[Frederick Brian Pickering|F. B. Pickering]] and T. Gladman throughout the 1960s, '70s, and '80s was fundamental to the development of modern high-strength low-alloy steels. Further innovations continue, with new manufacturing technologies and techniques being developed by the Sheffield universities and the organisations on the [[Advanced Manufacturing Park]].

While iron and steel have long been the main industries of Sheffield, [[coal mining]] has also been a major industry, particularly in the outlying areas, and the [[Palace of Westminster]] in [[London]] was built using [[limestone]] from [[quarry|quarries]] in the nearby village of [[Anston]]. Other areas of employment include [[call centre]]s, the [[City Council]], universities and [[hospital]]s. Sheffield currently produces more steel per year than at any other time in its history.<ref>[http://www.gnn.gov.uk/regions/default.asp?NewsAreaID=2&ReleaseID=-3&LocaleID=6 Government News Network] (Accessed [[23 October]] [[2005]])</ref> However, the industry is now less noticeable as it has become highly automated and employs far fewer staff than in the past.
[[Image:High_Street,_Sheffield.jpg|thumb|right|260px|High Street, Central Sheffield]]

Sheffield is also a major [[retail]] centre, although it compares unfavourably with other major cities, it is home to many [[High Street]] and [[department store]]s as well as designer boutiques. The main city centre shopping areas are on [[The Moor]] precinct, [[Fargate]], [[Orchard Square]] and the [[Devonshire Quarter]]. [[Department store]]s in Sheffield City centre include [[John Lewis Partnership|John Lewis]], [[Marks and Spencer]], [[Atkinsons]], Castle House [[Co-op (supermarket)|Co-op]] and [[Debenhams]]. Sheffield's main [[market]] is the [[Castle Market]], built above the remains of the castle. Shopping areas outside the city centre include the [[Meadowhall]] [[shopping centre]] and retail park, [[Ecclesall Road]], [[London Road (Sheffield)|London Road]], [[Hillsborough, South Yorkshire|Hillsborough]] and the [[Crystal Peaks]] [[shopping centre]]. There are also several retail parks around Crystal Peaks.
[[Image:OrchardSquareSheffield.jpeg|thumb|300px|left|Orchard Square]]

In a 2005 survey on spending potential, Meadowhall came 16th (third in out-of-town shopping centres behind [[Bluewater]](7th) and [[The Trafford Centre]](15th)) with <U+00A3>977 million while Sheffield city centre came 18th with <U+00A3>953 million.<ref>[http://www.caci.co.uk/msd.asp?url=lsp-retailfootprint.htm CACI survey retail rankings] (Accessed [[5 October]] [[2005]])</ref> In a 2004 survey on the top retail destinations, Meadowhall was 20th while Sheffield was 35th.<ref>[http://press.experian.com/ Expirian Website] [[2 March]] [[2004]] press release on retail rankings (Accessed [[5 October]] [[2005]])</ref> In both cases Sheffield is unique in being the only major city to have a shopping centre above the city centre in the lists. It is hoped that this problem can be rectified by the creation of the <U+00A3>500 million New Retail Quarter project.<ref>[http://www.sheffieldnrq.co.uk/overview.htm New Retail Quater] (Accessed [[28 December]] [[2005]])</ref>

==Government and politics==
[[Image:Sheffield Town Hall and The Peace Gardens.jpg|frame|right|Sheffield Town Hall and the Peace Gardens]]

Sheffield is governed by the elected [[Sheffield City Council]]. For most of the council's history it has been controlled by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. There was, however, a brief period of [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] control at the turn of the century. There are 84 councillors; the current council leader is [[Jan Wilson]]. The city also has a [[Lord Mayor]]. In the past the Office of Mayor had considerable authority, and carried with it executive powers over the finances and affairs of the city council. Today it is simply a ceremonial role. The current Lord Mayor is [[Jackie Drayton]].

The majority of council-owned facilities are now operated by independent charitable trusts. [[Sheffield International Venues]] runs many of the cities sporting and leisure facilities, including [[Sheffield Arena]] and [[Don Valley Stadium]]. [[Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust]] and the [[Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust]] take care of galleries and museums owned by the council. These include the [[Millennium Galleries]], [[Lyceum Theatre (Sheffield)|Lyceum Theatre]] and the [[Crucible Theatre]].

As a result a Polish [[consulate]] was opened in the City in 1997, the first new Polish consulate to open in the UK for over 60 years.<ref>[http://www.shef.ac.uk/uni/projects/pc/index.html Polish Consulate in Sheffield] (Accessed [[27 December]] [[2005]])</ref>

==Sport==
{{main|Sport in Sheffield}}
Sheffield has a long sporting heritage. In 1857 a collective of [[cricket]]ers formed the world's first-ever official [[Football (soccer)|football]] club, [[Sheffield F.C.]], and by 1860 there were 15 football clubs in Sheffield. There are now two local clubs in the [[English Football League teams|Football League]]: [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], both of which formed from cricket clubs, and two major non-league sides: Sheffield F.C. and [[Hallam F.C.]], which also formed from cricket clubs. These are the two oldest club sides in the world and, in addition, Hallam F.C. still play at the world's oldest football ground near the suburb of Crosspool. Sheffield and Hallam contest what has become known as the [[Sheffield derby]], whilst United and Wednesday contest the [[Steel City derby]].
[[Image:DonValleyStadium.jpg|thumb|300px|Don Valley Stadium during the World Student Games in 1991]]

Sheffield also has close ties with [[snooker]], due to the fact that the city's [[Crucible Theatre]] is the venue for the [[World Snooker Championships]]. The English [[Squash (sport)|squash]] open is also held there every year. The International Open [[Bowls]] tournament is held in Sheffield at [[Ponds Forge]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/bowls/6112106.stm Report on International Open bowls 2006]</ref>

Sheffield is home to 2004 World [[Superbike]] champion [[James Toseland]] and of climber [[Joe Simpson (mountaineer)|Joe Simpson]]. Former athlete and world record holder, [[Sebastian Coe, Baron Coe|Sebastian Coe]] grew up in the city and began his career as a member of the [[Hallamshire Harriers]].

Many of Sheffield's extensive sporting facilities were built for the [[Universiade|World Student Games]], which the city hosted in 1991. They include the [[Don Valley Stadium|Don Valley International Athletics Stadium]] which is the largest athletics stadium in the [[UK]] with a capacity of 50,500,<ref>[http://www.donvalleystadium.co.uk/content.php?nPageID=1 Main page of Don Valley Stadium]</ref> [[Sheffield Arena]], and [[Ponds Forge]] international diving and swimming complex, where [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] medallist [[Leon Taylor]] trains. There are also facilities for golf, climbing and bowling, as well as a newly inaugurated (2003) national ice-skating arena ([[IceSheffield]]). The [[Sheffield Ski Village]] is the largest artificial [[ski]] resort in Europe, and is due to undergo a major expansion soon.<ref name="SCCFACTS"/> The city also has three indoor [[climbing]] centres. Sheffield was the UK's first National City of Sport and is now home to the [[English Institute of Sport]] (EIS). Sheffield has taken a bid to either host the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]] or the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

==Culture and attractions==
{{main|Culture of Sheffield}}
7.2% of Sheffield's working population are employed in the creative industries, well above the national average of 4%.<ref name="SCCFACTS"/>  [[Open Up Sheffield]] is an annual event over the first two weekends in May where local [[visual art]]ists and fine [[craft]] workers invite the public to their studios and other venues.

===Music===
{{See also|List of musicians from Sheffield}}

Sheffield has been the home of several well-known bands and musicians, with an unusually large number of [[synth pop]] and other [[electronic music|electronic]] outfits hailing from there. These include the [[Human League]], [[Heaven 17]], [[ABC (band)|ABC]], the [[Thompson Twins]], [[Wavestar]] and the more [[Industrial music|industrially]] inclined [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]]. This electronic tradition has continued: [[techno music|techno]] label [[Warp Records]] was a central pillar of the [[Yorkshire Bleeps and Bass]] scene of the early 1990s, and has gone on to become one of Britain's oldest and best-loved dance music labels. [[Moloko]] and [[Autechre]], one of the leading lights of so-called [[intelligent dance music]], are also based in Sheffield. The city is also home to a number of nightclubs including [[Gatecrasher|Gatecrasher One]], one of the most popular [[nightclub]]s in the north of England.

Sheffield has also seen the birth of [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]], [[Def Leppard]], [[Joe Cocker]], [[Richard Hawley]], [[The Longpigs]] and the [[free improvisation|free improvisers]] [[Derek Bailey]] and [[Tony Oxley]]. The highly influential [[post-punk]] group the [[Comsat Angels]] hail from Sheffield. 1998 [[Mercury Music Prize]] award winners [[Gomez (band)|Gomez]] are also connected to Sheffield, as some of the founding members went to [[Sheffield University]]. The [[Arctic Monkeys]], who have recently exploded onto the UK music scene with their [[Mercury Music Prize]]-winning fastest selling debut album of all time and two Brit Awards (2007),<ref>[http://www.rockfeedback.com/article.asp?nObjectID=3021 rockfeedback.com] Arctic Monkeys review (Accessed [[27 December]] [[2005]])</ref> [[Milburn (band)|Milburn]], [[Little Man Tate]], [[the Long Blondes]], [[The Dodgems]], the [[math rock]] band [[65daysofstatic]], [[Bromheads Jacket]] and classic rockers [[Firegarden]] are amongst recent additions to the list. The city is also the base for a well developed and thriving unsigned music scene.
[[Image:National Centre for Popular Music.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Former National Centre for Popular Music]]

Sheffield also has a small urban music scene. This consists of R'n'B, UK Hiphop, Grime and Speed Garage. It is home to artists such as [[NoXcuse]], [[Hoodz Underground]], [[The Red Eye Knights]] and [[Constant Creation]], it is part of the [[Yorkshire Hip Hop]] scene. The Speed Garage scene has surfaced in Sheffield with a unique modern sound compared to older speed garage. Born from the nightclub Niche, the music has various other terms such as Bassline House or Niche itself, but was born in Sheffield and has now spread out to other cities in the United Kingdom. It varies differently from other cities Soulful Vocal UK Garage, and the beats are not two step.

The city's ties with music were acknowledged in 1999, when the [[National Centre for Popular Music]], a museum dedicated to the subject of [[popular music]], was opened. It was not as successful as was hoped, however, and later evolved to become a live music venue; then in February 2005, the unusual steel-covered building became the [[students' union]] for [[Sheffield Hallam University]]. Live music venues in the city include the [[Leadmill]], [[Corporation (nightclub)|Corporation]], the [[Plug(nightclub)|Plug]], the [[Boardwalk (nightclub)|Boardwalk]], the [[Sheffield City Hall|City Hall]], the [[University of Sheffield]] and the Studio Theatre at the [[Crucible Theatre]]. Smaller venues supporting  the local scene include [[Under the Boardwalk]] on Snig Hill, [[The Grapes (sheffield)|The Grapes]], [[D 'n' R Live]] now relocated to Arundel Gate, approximately opposite The Crucible) and [[The Cricketers Inn (Sheffield)|The Cricketers]].

Sheffield has a number of local orchestras including the Hallam Sinfonia, [[Sheffield Symphony Orchestra]], the Sheffield Chamber Orchestra, the Sheffield Philharmonic Orchestra and the [[City of Sheffield Youth Orchestra]]. There are also many choirs within Sheffield including [[Sheffield Cathedral Choir]], The [[University of Sheffield Singers' Society]], [[Hallam Choral Society]], Sheffield Bach Society and Sheffield Philharmonic Chorus. It is home to a strong [[brass band]] tradition, with bands associated with factories and villages.

Sheffield and its surrounding rural area have a strong tradition of local Christmas carols, including around 35 different 4-part settings for [[While Sheperds Watched]]. Many villages and areas of Sheffield have their own special carols, sometimes named after the location. There are also minor variations within carols between villages which must be observed by musicians travelling between venues. The carols' musical style dates from the [[Classical]] period. Keepers of the carolling tradition are often wary of newcomers to the city, and it can be hard for newcomers to discover the locations of the famous singing sessions.

[[Image:Sheffield_Winter_Garden.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|Sheffield Winter Gardens]]
[[Image:Lyceum theatre sheffield.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Lyceum & Crucible Theatres]]
Sheffield has two major theatres, the [[Lyceum Theatre (Sheffield)|Lyceum Theatre]] and the [[Crucible Theatre]], which together with the smaller [[Studio Theatre]] make up the largest theatre complex outside [[London]].<ref>[http://www.sheffieldtheatres.co.uk/ Sheffield Theatres] (accessed [[26 December]] [[2005]])</ref> There are four major [[art gallery|art galleries]], including the modern [[Millennium Galleries]] and the [[Site Gallery]], which specialises in multimedia.

[[Image:SheffieldBotGards.jpg|thumbnail|300px|left|The Glass Houses, Sheffield Botanical Gardens]]

There are about [[Listed buildings in Sheffield|1,000 listed buildings in Sheffield]] (including the whole of the Sheffield postal district). Of these, only five are Grade I listed. 42 are Grade II*, the rest being Grade II listed. Compared with other English cities Sheffield has few Grade I buildings. [[Liverpool]], for example, has [[Listed buildings in Liverpool|26 Grade I]] [[listed buildings]]. This situation led the noted architecture historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], writing in 1959, to comment that the city was "architecturally a miserable disappointment" with no pre-19th century buildings of any distinction.<ref>Harman, R. & Minnis, J. (2004) ''Pevsner City Guides: Sheffield'' p3. New Haven & London: Yale University Press. ISBN 0-300-10585-1</ref>

The city has many parks such as [[Millhouses Park]], [[Endcliffe Park]] and [[Graves Park]].

Large parts of the city are designated as [[SSSI|sites of special scientific interest]] (areas of land which the British Government considers to be of special interest by virtue of its fauna, flora, geological or physiographical features) including several urban areas.

===Media and film===
[[Image:Sheffield University Arts Tower.jpg|thumb|170px|right|The [[Arts Tower]], located on the campus of the University of Sheffield]]

The films ''[[The Full Monty]]'', ''[[Threads]]'', ''[[When Saturday Comes (film)|When Saturday Comes]]'' and ''[[Whatever Happened to Harold Smith?]]'' were based in the city. ''[[F.I.S.T.]]'' also included several scenes filmed in Sheffield. Sheffield's daily [[newspaper]] is the ''[[Sheffield Star]]'', complemented by the weekly ''[[Sheffield Telegraph]]''. The [[BBC]]'s [[BBC Radio Sheffield|Radio Sheffield]] and the independent [[Hallam FM]] and sister station [[Magic AM]] broadcast to the city. The [[Sheffield International Documentary Festival]], the UK's leading documentary festival, has been run annually since 1994 at the [[Showroom Cinema]]. A song by [[The Clash]] titled "[[This Is England]]" features the lyric: "This is England / This knife of Sheffield steel / This is England / This is how we feel." Sheffield will host the [[Awards of the International Indian Film Academy]] in 2007.

===Education===
{{main|Education in Sheffield}}
Sheffield has two [[universities]], the [[University of Sheffield]] and [[Sheffield Hallam University]]. The two combined bring 55,000 students to the city every year, including many from the [[Far East]]. As a result of its large student population, Sheffield has many bars, cafes, clubs and shops as well as student housing to accommodate them.

Sheffield has two [[further education]] [[colleges]]. [[Sheffield College]] is organised on a collegiate basis and was originally created from the merger of six colleges around the city, since reduced to just three: Castle in the city centre, Hillsborough and [[Norton, Sheffield, South Yorkshire|Norton]], each operating as semi-autonomous constituents of Sheffield College. [[Longley Park Sixth Form College]], managed by the [[Local Education Authority]] opened in 2004.

There are also 141 [[Primary education|primary schools]] and 27 [[Secondary education|secondary schools]], of which seven have [[sixth form]]s, namely [[High Storrs School (Sheffield)|High Storrs]], [[King Ecgbert School|King Ecgbert]], [[King Edward VII School (Sheffield)|King Edward VII]], [[Silverdale School (Sheffield)|Silverdale]], and [[Tapton School|Tapton]], all lying in the south or west of Sheffield, and the two Catholic schools, [http://www.allsaints.sheffield.sch.uk/ All Saints] and [[Notre Dame High School (Sheffield)|Notre Dame]].

==Transport==
{{Main|Transport in Sheffield}}
There are two main interchanges for all public transport modes (national and local rail, tram, local buses, coaches) at [[Meadowhall]] and in the [[Sheffield City Centre|city centre]].

===National and international travel===
====National and regional roads====
Sheffield is linked into the national motorway network via the [[M1 motorway (England)|M1]] and [[M18 motorway|M18]] motorways. The M1 skirts the north-east of the city, linking Sheffield with [[London]] to the south and [[Leeds]] to the north; the M18 branches from the M1 close to Sheffield, linking the city with [[Doncaster]], [[Robin Hood Doncaster Sheffield Airport]] and the [[Humber]] ports. The [[Sheffield Parkway]] connects the city centre with the motorways. The [[A57 road|A57]] and [[A61 road]]s are the major trunk roads through Sheffield, linking Sheffield with Manchester, Worksop, Barnsley, and Chesterfield.

====National rail====
The main line south from Sheffield links the city to the East Midlands and London: providing direct services to Nottingham, Derby, Leicester, Bedford (the fastest train Sheffield to London is two hours).  Also running through Sheffield is the main NE/SW cross-country line which links the East of Scotland and Northeast of England directly with West and South Yorkshire, the West Midlands, and the Southwest: providing direct services to Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Newcastle, Darlington, York, Leeds, Birmingham, Bristol, Taunton, and Exeter.  Sheffield also lies on the line linking Liverpool and Manchester with Hull and East Anglia: providing direct services to Liverpool, Manchester,  Hull, Lincoln, Ely and Norwich. Sheffield also has good links with its neighbouring towns and cities, [[Barnsley]], [[Doncaster]] and [[Rotherham]]. The main station for all these services is [[Sheffield Midland station|Sheffield Station]] on the south-eastern edge of the city centre. The station at [[Meadowhall Interchange|Meadowhall]] serves all trains travelling northeast except the fastest. Passenger rail services through Sheffield are provided by [[Midland Mainline]], [[Virgin Trains]], [[Central Trains]], [[TransPennine Express]], and [[Northern Rail]].<ref>[http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/system/galleries/download/print_maps/Nat_Rail_Passenger_Operators_2005.pdf UK rail network map] (PDF) showing which train companies operate on each route. Provided by [http://www.nationalrail.co.uk National Rail Enquiries] (Accessed [[28 December]] [[2005]])</ref>

====Coaches====
Sheffield is an important hub in the national network of long-distance buses (coaches), and there are direct services from distant cities such as Plymouth and Edinburgh.

====Air====
The closest international airport to Sheffield is [[Doncaster Sheffield]], which is located 18 miles from the city centre. The Airport opened on [[April 28]] [[2005]] and is served mainly by [[Low-cost carrier|budget airlines]] and currently handles around one million passengers a year. [[Sheffield City Airport]] opened in 1997 but, due in part to its short runway and lack of radar, has been unable to capitalise on the boom in low cost air travel. [[Manchester Airport]], [[Leeds Bradford International Airport]] and [[Nottingham East Midlands Airport]] all lie within a one hour's drive of the city. Manchester Airport is connected to Sheffield by [[South TransPennine|a direct train]] every hour.

===Local travel===
====Local roads====
The [[A57 road|A57]] and [[A61 road]]s are the major trunk roads through Sheffield. These run east-west and north-south, respectively, crossing in the city centre. Other major roads generally radiate spoke-like from the city centre. An inner [[ring road]], mostly constructed in the 1970s and currently (2006) being extended to form a complete ring,<ref>[http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/out--about/irr Inner Relief Road (Stage 2) - Wicker to Penistone Road] [[Sheffield City Council]], [[14 February]] [[2005]]</ref> allows traffic to avoid the city centre, and an outer "ring road" runs to the east, near the edge of the city, but does not serve the western side of Sheffield.
[[Image:Supertram Castle Square.jpg|thumb|right|400px|[[Sheffield Supertram]] at Castle Square]]

====Local rail====
Though the famously hilly topography of Sheffield and its nature in times gone by as a centre of industry rather than commerce meant that the city did not develop as extensive a suburban and inter-urban railway network as other comparable British cities. However, there are several busy local rail routes running along the city's valleys and beyond, bringing workers from all over [[South Yorkshire]] as well as from the closer parts of [[West Yorkshire]], [[Nottinghamshire]], Lincolnshire, and [[Derbyshire]]. These local routes include the [[Penistone Line]], the [[Dearne Valley Line]], the [[Hope Valley Line]], and the [[Hallam Line]]. As well as the main stations; [[Sheffield Midland station|Sheffield Midland]] and [[Meadowhall Interchange|Meadowhall]], there are four suburban stations at [[Chapeltown railway station|Chapeltown]], [[Darnall railway station|Darnall]], [[Woodhouse railway station|Woodhouse]] and near [[Dore railway station|Dore]].

====Light rail====
The light rail system ''[[Sheffield Supertram]]'', opened in 1994, serves the city. Its network consists of three lines that run from the city centre out to [[Hillsborough, South Yorkshire|Hillsborough]], [[Halfway, South Yorkshire|Halfway]], and [[Meadowhall]].<ref>[http://www.supertram.net/about.html Stagecoach Supertram:About Us] (Accessed [[28 December]] [[2005]])</ref>

====Local buses====
A sizeable [[bus]] infrastructure operates from a main hub at [[Pond Street bus station]]. Other bus stations lie at [[Meadowhall]] and [[Hillsborough, South Yorkshire|Hillsborough]]. A flurry of new operators were created after deregulation in 1986,<ref>[http://worldbank.org/transport/expopres/bayliss1.doc Bus Privatisation in the United Kingdom] [[World Bank]]</ref> including [[Caldaire]]-owned [[Sheffield & District]], and independents like [[Yorkshire Terrier (company)|Yorkshire Terrier]], [[Sheaf Line]], [[Andrew's]], [[Sheffield Omnibus]] and [[Northern Bus]]. The majority of these gradually amalgamated, Andrew's, Terrier, Sheaf Line and Sheffield Ominibus ending up with the [[Traction Group]] (or [[Yorkshire Traction]]), Sheffield & District and [[Sheffield United Travel]] ending up with Mainline and Northern Bus with successor First Mainline, leaving First South Yorkshire (formerly First [[Mainline (company)|Mainline]]), owned by [[FirstGroup plc]], as by far the largest bus operator. [[Stagecoach Sheffield]] (formerly Yorkshire Traction's Sheffield operation, Yorkshire Terrier), [[Stagecoach East Midlands]], [[TM Travel]] and [[Arriva Yorkshire]] also run bus routes in the city. In recent years a series of price rises and service cuts, by Mainline and First, has seen bus ridership drop<ref>[http://www.sheffieldtoday.net/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=58&ArticleID=1115892 Call for action to halt fall in bus passengers.] [[Sheffield Star]], [[16 August]] [[2005]]</ref> and has prompted angry commuters to start a campaign called [[We Want Our Buses Back]].<ref>[http://www.sheffieldtoday.net/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=58&ArticleID=1332988 Next stop in bus protest campaign.] [[Sheffield Star]], [[31 January]] [[2006]]</ref>

====Cycling====
Although hilly, Sheffield is compact and has few major trunk roads running through it. It is on the [[Trans-Pennine Trail]], a [[National Cycle Network]] route running from [[Southport]] in the north-west to [[Hornsea]] in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire|East Riding]], and has a developing Strategic Cycle Network within the city. The [[Peak District National Park]], an area of outstanding natural beauty popular with both on- and off-road cyclists, is so close to Sheffield that part of the park lies within the city boundary, and there are green routes into the park almost from the city centre.
