[[Image:Serp.png|thumb|right|A typical search results page]]{{Internet Marketing}}
'''Search engine optimization''' ('''SEO''') is the process of improving the volume and quality of traffic to a [[web site]] from [[Web search engine|search engine]]s via "natural" ("organic" or "[[algorithm]]ic") [[Search engine results page|search results]] for targeted [[keywords]]. Usually, the earlier a site is presented in the search results or the higher it "ranks", the more searchers will visit that site. SEO can also target different kinds of search, including [[image search]], [[local search (Internet)|local search]], and industry-specific [[vertical search]] engines. SEO can be approached in many ways, but the latest trend is [[Performance Based SEO]].

As a [[marketing]] strategy for increasing a site's relevance, SEO considers how search [[algorithms]] work and what people search for. SEO efforts may involve a site's coding, presentation, and structure, as well as fixing problems that could prevent [[search engine indexing]] programs from fully [[spidering]] a site. Another class of techniques, known as [[black hat]] SEO or [[spamdexing]], use methods such as [[link farm]]s  and [[keyword stuffing]] that tend to harm search engine user experience. Search engines look for sites that employ these techniques and may remove them from their indices.

The [[Acronym and initialism|initialism]] "SEO" can also refer to "search engine optimizers", terms adopted by an industry of [[consultants]] who carry out optimization projects on behalf of clients, and by employees who perform SEO services in-house. Search engine optimizers may offer SEO as a stand-alone service or as a part of a broader marketing campaign. Because effective SEO may require changes to the [[HTML]] source code of a site, SEO tactics may be incorporated into web site development and [[web site design|design]]. The term "search engine friendly" may be used to describe web site designs, [[menu (computing)|menus]], [[content management systems]], [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]], and [[Shopping cart software|shopping carts]] that are easy to optimize.

==History==
[[Webmaster]]s and content providers began optimizing sites for search engines in the mid-1990s, as the first search engines were cataloging the early [[World Wide Web|Web]]. Initially, all a webmaster needed to do was submit a page, or [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]], to the various engines which would send a [[Web crawler|spider]] to "crawl" that page, extract links to other pages from it, and return information found on the page to be [[Index (search engine)|indexed]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.webir.org/resources/phd/pinkerton_2000.pdf| format =PDF | title=Finding What People Want: Experiences with the WebCrawler|accessdate=2007-05-07| publisher=The Second International WWW Conference Chicago, USA, October 17<U+2013>20, 1994|author=Brian Pinkerton}}</ref> The process involves a search engine spider downloading a page and storing it on the search engine's own server, where a second program, known as an [[search engine indexing|indexer]], extracts various information about the page, such as the words it contains and where these are located, as well as any weight for specific words and all links the page contains, which are then placed into a scheduler for crawling at a later date.

Site owners started to recognize the value of having their sites highly ranked and visible in search engine results.They also recognised that the higher their site ranking the more people would click on the website. According to industry analyst [[Danny Sullivan (technologist)|Danny Sullivan]], the earliest known use of the phrase ''search engine optimization'' was a spam message posted on Usenet on [[July 26]], [[1997]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.searchenginewatch.com/showpost.php?p=2119&postcount=10|title=Who Invented the Term "Search Engine Optimization"?|author=Danny Sullivan|publisher=[[Search Engine Watch]]|date=[[June 14]], [[2004]]|accessdate=2007-05-14}} See [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.current-events.net-abuse.spam/browse_thread/thread/6fee2777dc17b8ab/3858bff94e56aff3?lnk=st&q=%22search+engine+optimization%22&rnum=1#3858bff94e56aff3 Google groups thread].</ref>

Early versions of search [[algorithm]]s relied on webmaster-provided information such as the keyword [[meta tag]], or index files in engines like [[Aliweb|ALIWEB]]. Meta tags provided a guide to each page's content. But using meta data to index pages was found to be less than reliable because the webmaster's account of keywords in the meta tag were not truly relevant to the site's actual keywords. Inaccurate, incomplete, and inconsistent data in meta tags caused pages to rank for irrelevant searches.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.e-learningguru.com/articles/metacrap.htm|title=Metacrap: Putting the torch to seven straw-men of the meta-utopia|author=[[Cory Doctorow]]|date=[[August 26]], [[2001]]|publisher=e-LearningGuru|accessdate=2007-05-08}}</ref> Web content providers also manipulated a number of attributes within the HTML source of a page in an attempt to rank well in search engines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~lloyd/tilde/InterNet/Search/1998_WWW7.html|title=What is a tall poppy among web pages?|date=April 1998|publisher=Proc. 7th Int. World Wide Web Conference|accessdate=2007-05-08|author=Pringle, G., Allison, L., and Dowe, D.}}</ref>

By relying so much on factors exclusively within a webmaster's control, early search engines suffered from abuse and ranking manipulation. To provide better results to their users, search engines had to adapt to ensure their [[SERP|results pages]] showed the most relevant search results, rather than unrelated pages stuffed with numerous keywords by unscrupulous webmasters. Since the success and popularity of a search engine is determined by its ability to produce the most relevant results to any given search allowing those results to be false would turn users to find other search sources. Search engines responded by developing more complex ranking [[algorithm]]s, taking into account additional factors that were more difficult for webmasters to manipulate.  

Graduate students at [[Stanford University]], [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]] developed "backrub", a search engine that relied on a mathematical [[algorithm]] to rate the prominence of web pages. The number calculated by the algorithm, [[PageRank]], is a function of the quantity and strength of [[inbound link]]s.<ref name="lgscalehyptxt">{{cite web|author=Brin, Sergey and Page, Larry|url=http://www-db.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html|title=The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine|publisher=Proceedings of the seventh international conference on World Wide Web|date=1998|page=107<U+2013>117|accessdate=2007-05-08}}</ref> PageRank estimates the likelihood that a given page will be reached by a web user who randomly surfs the web, and follows links from one page to another. In effect, this means that some links are stronger than others, as a higher PageRank page is more likely to be reached by the random surfer.

Page and Brin founded [[Google]] in 1998. Google attracted a loyal following among the growing number of Internet users, who liked its simple design.<ref name="bbc-1">{{cite web|author=Thompson, Bill|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3334531.stm|title=Is Google good for you?|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[December 19]], [[2003]]|accessdate=2007-05-16}}</ref> Off-page factors such as PageRank and hyperlink analysis were considered, as well as on-page factors, to enable Google to avoid the kind of manipulation seen in search engines that only considered on-page factors for their rankings. Although PageRank was more difficult to game, webmasters had already developed link building tools and schemes to influence the [[Inktomi]] search engine, and these methods proved similarly applicable to gaining PageRank. Many sites focused on exchanging, buying, and selling links, often on a massive scale. Some of these schemes, or [[link farm]]s, involved the creation of thousands of sites for the sole purpose of [[spamdexing|link spamming]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Zoltan Gyongyi and Hector Garcia-Molina|url=http://infolab.stanford.edu/~zoltan/publications/gyongyi2005link.pdf| format = PDF | title=Link Spam Alliances|publisher=Proceedings of the 31st VLDB Conference, Trondheim, Norway|date=2005|accessdate=2007-05-08}}</ref>

By 2007, search engines had incorporated a wide range of undisclosed factors in their ranking algorithms to reduce the impact of link manipulation. Google says it ranks sites using more than 200 different signals.<ref name="nyt0607">{{cite web|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2007-06-06|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/business/yourmoney/03google.html|title=Google Keeps Tweaking Its Search Engine|date=[[June 3]], [[2007]]}}</ref> The three leading search engines, Google, [[Yahoo]] and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Live Search]], do not disclose the algorithms they use to rank pages. Notable SEOs, such as Rand Fishkin, [[Barry Schwartz (technologist)|Barry Schwartz]], [[Aaron Wall]] and [[Jill Whalen]], have studied different approaches to search engine optimization, and have published their opinions in online forums and blogs.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Danny Sullivan (technologist)|Danny Sullivan]]|url=http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/050929-072711|title=Rundown On Search Ranking Factors|publisher=[[Search Engine Watch]]|date=[[September 29]], [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-05-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seomoz.org/article/search-ranking-factors|title=Search Engine Ranking Factors V2|publisher=SEOmoz.org|date=[[April 2]], [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref>  SEO practitioners may also study patents held by various search engines to gain insight into the algorithms.<ref>{{cite web|author=Christine Churchill|url=http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=3564261|title=Understanding Search Engine Patents|publisher=[[Search Engine Watch]]|date=[[November 23]], [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-05-08}}</ref>

==Webmasters and search engines==
By 1997 search engines recognized that webmasters were making efforts to rank well in their search engines, and that some webmasters were even manipulating their rankings in search results by stuffing pages with excessive or irrelevant keywords. Early search engines, such as [[Infoseek]], adjusted their algorithms in an effort to prevent webmasters from manipulating rankings.<ref name="infoseeknyt">{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DF123BF932A25752C1A960958260 |title=Desperately Seeking Surfers|author=Laurie J. Flynn|date=[[November 11]], [[1996]]|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref>

Due to the high marketing value of targeted search results, there is potential for an adversarial relationship between search engines and SEOs. In 2005, an annual conference, AIRWeb, Adversarial Information Retrieval on the Web,<ref name="airweb">{{cite web|url=http://airweb.cse.lehigh.edu/|title=AIRWeb|publisher=Adversarial Information Retrieval on the Web, annual conference|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref> was created to discuss and minimize the damaging effects of aggressive web content providers.

SEO companies that employ overly aggressive techniques can get their client websites banned from the search results. In 2005, the [[Wall Street Journal]] profiled a company, [[Traffic Power]], which allegedly used high-risk techniques and failed to disclose those risks to its clients.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Startup Journal ([[Wall Street Journal]])|url=http://www.startupjournal.com/ecommerce/ecommerce/20050923-kesmodel.html|title='Optimize' Rankings At Your Own Risk|author=David Kesmodel|date=[[September 9]], [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref> [[Wired Magazine|Wired]] magazine reported that the same company sued blogger [[Aaron Wall]] for writing about the ban.<ref name="wired09082005">{{cite web|publisher=[[Wired Magazine]]|url=http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,68799,00.html|title=Legal Showdown in Search Fracas|date=[[September 8]], [[2005]]|author=Adam L. Penenberg|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref> Google's [[Matt Cutts]] later confirmed that Google did in fact ban Traffic Power and some of its clients.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=mattcutts.com/blog| author=[[Matt Cutts]]|url=http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/confirming-a-penalty/|title=Confirming a penalty|date=[[February 2]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref>

Some search engines have also reached out to the SEO industry, and are frequent sponsors and guests at SEO conferences, chats, and seminars. In fact, with the advent of paid inclusion, some search engines now have a vested interest in the health of the optimization community. Major search engines provide information and guidelines to help with site optimization.<ref name="g-wmguide" /><ref name="ms-wmguide" /><ref name="y-wmguide" /> Google has a [[Sitemaps]] program<ref name="googlesitemaps">{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/login|title=Google Webmaster Tools|publisher=google.com|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref> to help webmasters learn if Google is having any problems indexing their website and also provides data on Google traffic to the website. Yahoo! Site Explorer provides a way for webmasters to submit URLs, determine how many pages are in the Yahoo! index and view link information.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com |title=Yahoo! Site Explorer|publisher=yahoo.com|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref>
===Getting indexed===
The leading search engines, Google, Yahoo! and Microsoft, use crawlers to find pages for their algorithmic search results. Pages that are linked from other search engine indexed pages do not need to be submitted because they are found automatically. Some search engines, notably Yahoo!, operate a paid submission service that guarantee crawling for either a set fee or [[Pay per click|cost per click]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=2167871|title= Submitting To Search Crawlers: Google, Yahoo, Ask & Microsoft's Live Search |date=[[2007]]-[[03-12]]|accessdate=2007-05-15|publisher=[[Search Engine Watch]]}}</ref> Such programs usually guarantee inclusion in the database, but do not guarantee specific ranking within the search results.<ref>{{cite web|title=Search Submit|url=http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com/srchsb/index.php|publisher=searchmarketing.yahoo.com|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref> Yahoo's paid inclusion program has drawn criticism from advertisers and competitors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A48042-2004Mar10|title=Questionable Results at Revamped Yahoo | publisher=[[Washington Post]] | date=[[2004]]-[[03-11]]|accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref> Two major directories, the Yahoo Directory and the [[Open Directory Project]] both require manual submission and human editorial review.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=2167881|title= Submitting To Directories: Yahoo & The Open Directory |date=[[2007]]-[[03-12]]|accessdate=2007-05-15|publisher=[[Search Engine Watch]]}}</ref> Google offers [[Google Webmaster Tools]], for which an XML [[Sitemap]] feed can be created and submitted for free to ensure that all pages are found, especially pages that aren't discoverable by automatically following links.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=40318&topic=8514|title=What is a Sitemap file and why should I have one?|publisher=google.com|accessdate=2007-03-19}}</ref>

[[Web search engine|Search engine]] crawlers may look at a number of different factors when [[Web crawler|crawling]] a site. Not every page is indexed by the search engines. Distance of pages from the root directory of a site may also be a factor in whether or not pages get crawled.<ref name="cho">{{cite web|url=http://dbpubs.stanford.edu:8090/pub/1998-51|title=Efficient crawling through URL ordering|author=Cho, J., Garcia-Molina, H.|date=1998|publisher=Proceedings of the seventh conference on World Wide Web, Brisbane, Australia|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref>

===Preventing indexing===
{{main|Robots Exclusion Standard}}
To avoid undesirable content in the search indexes, webmasters can instruct spiders not to crawl certain files or directories through the standard [[robots.txt]] file in the root directory of the domain. Additionally, a page can be explicitly excluded from a search engine's database by using a [[meta tag]] specific to robots. When a search engine visits a site, the robots.txt located in the [[root directory]] is the first file crawled. The robots.txt file is then parsed, and will instruct the robot as to which pages are not to be crawled. As a search engine crawler may keep a cached copy of this file, it may on occasion crawl pages a webmaster does not wish crawled. Pages typically prevented from being crawled include login specific pages such as shopping carts and user-specific content such as search results from internal searches. In March 2007, Google warned webmasters that they should prevent indexing of internal search results because those pages are considered search spam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/070508-165231.php|title=Newspapers Amok!

==White hat versus black hat==
SEO techniques are classified by some into two broad categories: techniques that search engines recommend as part of good design and those techniques that search engines do not approve of and attempt to minimize the effect of, referred to as [[spamdexing]]. Industry commentators have classified these methods, and the practitioners who employ them, as either [[white hat]] SEO, or [[black hat]] SEO.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andrew Goodman|publisher=SearchEngineWatch|url=http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=3483941|title=Search Engine Showdown: Black hats vs. White hats at SES|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref> White hats tend to produce results that last a long time, whereas black hats anticipate that their sites may eventually be banned either temporarily or permanently once the search engines discover what they are doing.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Jill Whalen]]|url=http://www.searchengineguide.com/whalen/2004/1116_jw1.html|title=Black Hat/White Hat Search Engine Optimization|publisher=searchengineguide.com|accessdate=2007-05-09|date=[[November 16]], [[2004]]}}</ref>

An SEO technique is considered white hat if it conforms to the search engines' guidelines and involves no deception. As the search engine guidelines<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/webmasters/seo.html|title=What's an SEO? Does Google recommend working with companies that offer to make my site Google-friendly? |publisher = google.com |
| accessdate=2007-04-18}}</ref><ref name="g-wmguide">{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/webmasters/guidelines.html|title=Google's Guidelines on Site Design|accessdate=2007-04-18|publisher=google.com}}</ref><ref name="ms-wmguide">{{cite web|url=http://search.msn.com/docs/siteowner.aspx?t=SEARCH_WEBMASTER_REF_GuidelinesforOptimizingSite.htm|title=Site Owner Help: MSN Search Web Crawler and Site Indexing |publisher = msn.com | accessdate=2007-04-18}}</ref><ref name="y-wmguide">{{cite web|url=http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/search/basics/basics-18.html|title=Yahoo! Search Content Quality Guidelines|accessdate=2007-04-18|publisher=help.yahoo.com}}</ref> are not written as a series of rules or commandments, this is an important distinction to note. White hat SEO is not just about following guidelines, but is about ensuring that the content a search engine indexes and subsequently ranks is the same content a user will see.

White hat advice is generally summed up as creating content for users, not for search engines, and then making that content easily accessible to the spiders, rather than attempting to trick the algorithm from its intended purpose. White hat SEO is in many ways similar to web development that promotes accessibility,<ref>{{cite web|author=Andy Hagans|publisher=[[A List Apart]]|url=http://alistapart.com/articles/accessibilityseo|title=High Accessibility Is Effective Search Engine Optimization|date = [[November 08]] [[2005]] | accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref> although the two are not identical.

[[spamdexing|Black hat SEO]] attempts to improve rankings in ways that are disapproved of by the search engines, or involve deception. One black hat technique uses text that is hidden, either as text colored similar to the background, in an invisible [[Span and div|div]], or positioned off screen. Another method gives a different page depending on whether the page is being requested by a human visitor or a search engine, a technique known as [[cloaking]].

Search engines may penalize sites they discover using black hat methods, either by reducing their rankings or eliminating their listings from their databases altogether. Such penalties can be applied either automatically by the search engines' algorithms, or by a manual site review.

One infamous example was the February 2006 Google removal of both [[BMW]] Germany and [[Ricoh]] Germany for use of deceptive practices.<ref name="intwebspam">{{cite web|url=http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/ramping-up-on-international-webspam/|publisher = mattcutts.com/blog | title=Ramping up on international webspam|publisher=mattcutts.com/blog|author=[[Matt Cutts]]|date=[[February 4]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref> Both companies, however, quickly apologized, fixed the offending pages, and were restored to Google's list.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2007-05-09|url=http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/recent-reinclusions/|publisher = mattcutts.com/blog | title=Recent reinclusions|author=[[Matt Cutts]]|date=[[February 7]] [[2006]]}}</ref>

==As a marketing strategy==
Eye tracking studies have shown that searchers scan a search results page from top to bottom and left to right (for left to right languages), looking for a relevant result. Placement at or near the top of the rankings therefore increases the number of searchers who will visit a site.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Search Engine Watch]]|title=A New F-Word for Google Search Results|url=http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=3488076|date=[[March 8]], [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-05-16}}</ref> However, more search engine referrals does not guarantee more sales. SEO is not necessarily an appropriate strategy for every website, and other Internet marketing strategies can be much more effective, depending on the site operator's goals.<ref>{{cite web|title=What SEO Isn't|url=http://blog.v7n.com/2006/06/24/what-seo-isnt/|publisher=blog.v7n.com|date=[[June 24]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-05-16}}</ref>A successful Internet marketing campaign may drive organic traffic to web pages, but it also may involve the use of paid advertising on search engines and other pages, building high quality web pages to engage and persuade, addressing technical issues that may keep search engines from crawling and indexing those sites, setting up analytics programs to enable site owners to measure their successes, and improving a site's [[conversion rate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grokdotcom.com/2007/03/13/the-battle-between-search-engine-optimization-and-conversion-who-wins/|title=The Battle Between Search Engine Optimization and Conversion: Who Wins?|author=Melissa Burdon|publisher=Grok.com|accessdate=2007-05-09|date=[[March 13]] [[2007]]}}</ref>

SEO may generate a [[return on investment]]. However, search engines are not paid for organic search traffic, their algorithms change, and there are no guarantees of continued referrals. Due to this lack of guarantees and certainty, a business that relies heavily on search engine traffic can suffer major losses if the search engines stop sending visitors.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Forbes]]|url=http://www.forbes.com/technology/2007/04/29/sanar-google-skyfacet-tech-cx_ag_0430googhell.html?partner=rss|title=Condemned To Google Hell|author=Andy Greenberg|date=[[April 30]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref> It is considered wise business practice for website operators to liberate themselves from dependence on search engine traffic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/search_engines.html| publisher = useit.com | title=Search Engines as Leeches on the Web|date=[[January 9]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-05-14 |author=[[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]]}}</ref> A top-ranked SEO blog Seomoz.org<ref>{{cite web|publisher=searchenginejournal.com| url=http://www.searchenginejournal.com/seomoz-best-seo-blog-of-2006/4195/|title=SEOmoz: Best SEO Blog of 2006|accessdate=2007-05-31|date=[[January 3]], [[2007]]}}</ref> has reported, "Search marketers, in a twist of irony, receive a very small share of their traffic from search engines."

==International markets==
[[Image:Baidu-serp.jpg|thumb|right|A Baidu search results page]]
The search engines' market shares vary from market to market, as does competition.
In 2003, [[Danny Sullivan (technologist)|Danny Sullivan]] stated that Google represented about 75% of all searches.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2003-08-25-google_x.htm|title=The search engine that could|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2007-05-15|date=[[2003-08-26]]}}</ref> In markets outside the [[United States of America|United States]], Google's share is often larger, and Google remains the dominant search engine worldwide as of 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=3625072 | Author=Greg Jarboe | title=Stats Show Google Dominates the International Search Landscape | publisher=[[Search Engine Watch]] | date=[[2007]]-[[02-22]] | accessdate=2007-05-15 }}</ref> As of 2006, Google held about 40% of the market in the United States, but Google had an 85-90% market share in [[Germany]].<ref name="grehan-1">{{cite web|url=http://www.clickz.com/showPage.html?page=3595926|title=Search Engine Optimizing for Europe |author=Mike Grehan|date=[[April 3]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-05-14|publisher=Click}}</ref> While there were hundreds of SEO firms in the US at that time, there were only about five in Germany.<ref name="grehan-1" /> 

In Russia the situation is reversed. Local search engine [[Yandex]] controls 50% of the paid advertising revenue, while Google has less than 9%.<ref>{{cite news |first= Eric |last = Pfanner |title= New to Russia, Google Struggles to Find Its Footing |publisher= New York Times | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/18/technology/18google.html?ex=1179374400&en=0da5cb873cb45b2e&ei=5070 |date=[[December 18]], [[2006]] |accessdate= 2007-05-15}}</ref> In China, [[Baidu]] continues to lead in market share, although Google has been gaining share as of 2007.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://searchengineland.com/070306-144912.php |title=Google Gaining, But Baidu Still Dominates In China|date=[[March 6]], [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-05-15|publisher=Search Engine Land}}</ref>

Successful search optimization for international markets may require professional [[language translation|translation]] of web pages, registration of a domain name with a [[top level domain]] in the target market, and [[web hosting]] that provides a local [[IP address]]. Otherwise, the fundamental elements of search optimization are essentially the same, regardless of language.<ref name="grehan-1" />
==Legal precedents==
On October 17, 2002, [[SearchKing]] filed suit in the United States District Court, Western District of Oklahoma, against the search engine Google. SearchKing's claim was that Google's tactics to prevent [[spamdexing]] constituted a tortious interference with contractual relations. <!-- This may be compared to lawsuits that email spammers have filed against spam-fighters, as in various cases against MAPS and other [[DNSBL]]s. --> On May 27, 2003, the court granted Google's motion to dismiss the complaint because SearchKing "failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/618281/Order-(Granting-Googles-Motion-to-Dismiss-Search-Kings-Complaint)| format = PDF | publisher=docstoc.com| title=Search King, Inc. v.

Kinderstart's web site was removed from Google's index prior to the lawsuit and the amount of traffic to the site dropped by 70%. On [[March 16]], [[2007]] the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] ([[San Jose, California|San Jose]] Division) dismissed KinderStart's complaint without leave to amend, and partially granted Google's motion for [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure#Chapter III - Pleadings and Motions|Rule 11]] sanctions against KinderStart's attorney, requiring him to pay part of Google's legal expenses.<ref>
