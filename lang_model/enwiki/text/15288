The '''Toraja''' are an [[ethnic group]] [[indigenous people|indigenous]] to a mountainous region of [[South Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]].  Their population is approximately 650,000, of which 450,000 still live in the [[List of regencies and cities of Indonesia|regency]] of [[Tana Toraja]] ("Land of Toraja").<ref name="official"/>  Most of the population is [[Christianity|Christian]], and others are [[Islam|Muslim]] or have local [[animism|animist]] beliefs known as ''aluk'' ("the way").  The Indonesian government has recognized this animist belief as ''Aluk To Dolo'' ("Way of the Ancestors").

The word ''toraja'' comes from the [[Bugis]] [[Buginese language|language]]'s ''to riaja'', meaning "people of the uplands". The [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]] named the people ''Toraja'' in 1909.<ref name="Nooy-Palm1975"/> Torajans are renowned for their elaborate funeral rites, burial sites carved into rocky cliffs, massive peaked-roof traditional houses known as ''[[tongkonan]]'', and colorful [[wood carving]]s. Toraja funeral rites are important social events, usually attended by hundreds of people and lasting for several days.

Before the 20th century, Torajans lived in [[autonomous]] villages, where they practised animism and were relatively untouched by the outside world. In the early 1900s, Dutch missionaries first worked to convert Torajan highlanders to Christianity.  When the Tana Toraja regency was further opened to the outside world in the 1970s, it became an icon of [[tourism in Indonesia]]: it was exploited by tourism developers and studied by [[anthropologist]]s.<ref name="Adams1990"/> By the 1990s, when tourism peaked, Toraja society had [[sociocultural evolution|evolved]] significantly, from its agricultural beginnings&mdash;in which [[social life]] and customs were outgrowths of the ''Aluk To Dolo''&mdash;into a largely Christian society.<ref name="Adams1995">{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=Kathleen M.|title=Making-Up the Toraja?

==Ethnic identity==
The Torajan people had little notion of themselves as a distinct [[ethnic group]] before the 20th century. Before [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonization]] and [[Christianization]], Torajans, who lived in highland areas, identified with their villages and did not share a broad sense of identity. Although complexes of rituals created linkages between highland villages, there were variations in dialects, differences in social hierarchies, and an array of ritual practices in the [[Sulawesi]] highland region. "Toraja" (from the coastal languages' ''to'', meaning people; and ''riaja'', uplands) was first used as a lowlander expression for highlanders.<ref name="Nooy-Palm1975">{{cite journal|author=Nooy-Palm, Hetty| title=Introduction to the Sa'dan People and their Country| journal=Archipel| volume=15 |date=1975 |pages=163&mdash;192}}</ref> As a result, "Toraja" initially had more currency with outsiders&mdash;such as the [[Bugis]] and [[Makassarese]], who constitute a majority of the lowland of Sulawesi&mdash;than with insiders. The Dutch missionaries' presence in the highlands gave rise to the Toraja ethnic consciousness in the Sa'dan Toraja region, and this shared identity grew with the rise of tourism in the [[Tana Toraja|Tana Toraja Regency]].<ref name="Adams1990"/> Since then, South Sulawesi has four main ethnic groups&mdash;the Bugis (the majority, including shipbuilders and seafarers), the Makassarese (lowland traders and seafarers), the Mandarese (traders and fishermen), and the Toraja (highland rice cultivators).<ref name="Sutton1995">{{cite journal| title=Performing arts and cultural politics in South Sulawesi   |author=Sutton, R.

==History==
<!--Hide this paragraph. I don't have time to find the page number as requested by FAC reviewers---The [[Gulf of Tonkin]], lying between northern [[Vietnam]] and southern [[China]], is believed to be the origin of the Torajans.<ref name="cyrut">{{cite book|author=Kruyt, A.C.|title=De West-Toradjas op Midden-Celebes|date= 1938|publisher=Noord-Hollandsche Uitgevers-Maatschappij|location=Amsterdam|language=[[Dutch language|Dutch]]}}</ref>  There has been a long acculturation process of local [[Malay race|Malay people]] in Sulawesi with these Chinese immigrants.  At first, the immigrants lived along Sulawesi's coastal areas, near Enrekang Bay, but subsequently moved upland.
-->
From the 17th century, the Dutch established trade and political control on Sulawesi through the [[Dutch East Indies Company]]. Over two centuries, they ignored the mountainous area in the central Sulawesi, where Torajans lived, because access was difficult and it had little productive agricultural land. In the late 19th century, the Dutch became increasingly concerned about the spread of [[Islam]] in the south of Sulawesi, especially among the Makassarese and Bugis peoples.  The Dutch saw the animist highlanders as potential [[Christians]].  In the 1920s, the Reformed Missionary Alliance of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] began [[Mission (Christian)|missionary]] work aided by the Dutch colonial government.<ref name="Volkman1990"/>  In addition to introducing [[Christianity]], the Dutch [[abolitionism|abolished slavery]] and imposed local taxes.  A line was drawn around the Sa'dan area and called ''Tana Toraja'' ("the land of Toraja").  Tana Toraja was first a subdivision of the [[Luwu|Luwu kingdom]] that had claimed the area.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Houses, hierarchy, headhunting and exchange; Rethinking political relations in the Southeast Asian realm of Luwu<U+2019> |author=Schrauwers, Albert |journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde |volume=153 |date=1997 |issue=3 |pages=356&ndash;380 |url=http://www.kitlv-journals.nl/files/pdf/art_BKI_1613.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref> In 1946, the Dutch granted Tana Toraja a [[Subdivisions of Indonesia|''regentschap'']], and it was recognized in 1957 as one of the [[List of regencies and cities of Indonesia|regencies of Indonesia]].<ref name="Volkman1990"/>

Early Dutch missionaries faced strong opposition among Torajans, especially among the elite, because the abolition of their profitable [[slave trade]] had angered them.<ref name="Nooy-Palm88">cf. Kis-Jovak et al (1988), Ch. 2, Hetty Nooy-Palm, ''The World of Toraja'', pp. 12&ndash;18.</ref> Some Torajans were forcibly relocated to the lowlands by the Dutch, where they could be more easily controlled. Taxes were kept high, undermining the wealth of the elites. Ultimately, the Dutch influence did not subdue Torajan culture, and only a few Torajans were [[Religious conversion|converted]].<ref name="Ngelow2004">{{cite journal|last=Ngelow|first=Zakaria J.|url=http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/miscPublications/I-R/pdf/45-Ngelow.pdf|format=PDF|title=Traditional Culture, Christianity and Globalization in Indonesia: The Case of Torajan Christians|journal=Inter-Religio|volume=45|date=Summer 2004|accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref>  In 1950, only 10% of the population had converted to Christianity.<ref name="Nooy-Palm88"/>

In the 1930s, Muslim lowlanders attacked the Torajans, resulting in widespread Christian conversion among those who sought to align themselves with the Dutch for [[Political asylum|political protection]] and to form a movement against the Bugis and Makassarese Muslims.  Between 1951 and 1965 (following [[Indonesian National Revolution|Indonesian independence]]), southern Sulawesi faced a turbulent period as the [[Darul Islam]] separatist movement fought for an [[Islamic state]] in Sulawesi.  The 15 years of [[guerrilla warfare]] led to massive conversions to Christianity.<ref name="Volkman1983">{{cite journal|last=Volkman|first=Toby Alice|title=A View from the Mountains|url=http://www.cs.org/publications/csq/csq-article.cfm?id=150|journal=Cultural Survival Quarterly|issue=4|volume=7|date=[[December 31]] [[1983]]|accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref>

Alignment with the Indonesian government, however, did not guarantee safety for the Torajans.  In 1965, a presidential decree required every Indonesian citizen to belong to one of five officially recognized religions: Islam, Christianity ([[Protestantism]] and [[Catholicism]]), [[Hinduism]], or [[Buddhism]].<ref name="Yang2005">{{cite journal|last=Yang|date=August 2005|first=Heriyanto|title=The history and legal position of Confucianism in postindependence Indonesia|journal=Marburg Journal of Religion|volume=10|issue=1| url=http://web.uni-marburg.de/religionswissenschaft/journal/mjr/pdf/2005/yang2005.pdf |format = PDF |accessdate = 2007-05-18}}</ref>  The Torajan religious belief (''aluk'') was not legally recognized, and the Torajans raised their voices against the law.  To make ''aluk'' accord with the law, it had to be accepted as part of one of the official religions.  In 1969, ''Aluk To Dolo'' ("the way of ancestors") was legalized as a [[sect]] of [[Agama Hindu Dharma]], the official name of Hinduism in Indonesia.<ref name="Volkman1990">{{cite journal|last=Volkman|first=Toby Alice|title=Visions and Revisions: Toraja Culture and the Tourist Gaze| url= http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0094-0496%28199002%2917%3A1%3C91%3AVARTCA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-G |journal= American Ethnologist |issue=1| volume=17|date=February 1990|pages=91&ndash;110|accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref>

==Society==
There are three main types of affiliation in Toraja society: family, class and religion. 

===Family affiliation===
[[Image:Tana Toraja.jpg|thumb|right|A Toraja village]]
Family is the [[Primary group|primary social]] and political grouping in Torajan society. Each village is one [[extended family]], the seat of which is the ''tongkonan'', a traditional Torajan house.  Each ''tongkonan'' has a name, which becomes the name of the village.  The familial dons maintain village unity. Marriage between distant cousins (fourth cousins and beyond) is a common practice that strengthens [[kinship]]. Toraja society prohibits marriage between close cousins (up to and including the third cousin)<U+2014>except for nobles, to prevent the dispersal of property.<ref name="Waterson1986">{{cite journal| title=The ideology and terminology of kinship among the Sa<U+2019>dan Toraja   |journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde| author=Waterson, Roxana| volume=142 |date=1986 |issue=1 |pages=87&ndash;112| url=http://www.kitlv-journals.nl/files/pdf/art_BKI_1261.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref> Kinship is actively [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocal]], meaning that the extended family helps each other farm, share buffalo rituals, and pay off debts. 

Each person belongs to both the mother's and the father's families, the only bilateral family line in Indonesia.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Waterson, Roxana| journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde| title=Houses, graves and the limits of kinship groupings among the Sa<U+2019>dan Toraja |volume=151 |issue=2 |date=1995 |url=http://www.kitlv-journals.nl/files/pdf/art_BKI_1545.pdf| format=PDF|pages=194&ndash;217 |accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref> Children, therefore, inherit household affiliation from both mother and father, including land and even family debts.  Children's names are given on the basis of kinship, and are usually chosen after dead relatives. Names of aunts, uncles and cousins are commonly referred to in the names of mothers, fathers and siblings.

Before the start of the formal administration of Toraja villages by the [[Tana Toraja|Tana Toraja Regency]], each Toraja village was [[autonomous]]. In a more complex situation, in which one Toraja family could not handle their problems alone, several villages formed a group; sometimes, villages would unite against other villages. Relationship between families was expressed through blood, marriage, and shared ancestral houses (''tongkonan''), practically signed by the exchange of buffalo and pigs on ritual occasions. Such exchanges did not only build political and cultural ties between families, but defined each person's place in a social hierarchy: who poured [[palm wine]], who wrapped a corpse and prepared offerings, where each person could or could not sit, what dishes should be used or avoided, and even what piece of meat constituted one's share.<ref name="Volkman1984"/>

[[Image:Torajankids2.jpg|thumb|left|Torajan children in Maruang.]]

===Class affiliation===

In early Toraja society, family relationships were tied closely to [[social class]]. There were three strata: [[nobles]], [[Middle class|commoners]], and [[slaves]]; slavery was [[abolitionism|abolished]] in 1909 by the [[Dutch East Indies]] government. Class was inherited through the mother. It was taboo, therefore, to marry "down" with a woman of lower class.  On the other hand, marrying a woman of [[Upper class|higher class]] could improve the status of the next generation. 

The nobility's condescending attitude toward the commoners is still maintained for reasons of family prestige.<ref name="Adams1995"/>  Nobles, who were believed to be direct descendants of the descended person from heaven,<ref name="Wellenkamp1998">{{cite journal|last=Wellenkamp|first=Jane C.|title=Order and Disorder in Toraja Thought and Ritual |journal= Ethnology| volume=27 |issue=3 |date=1988|pages=311-326}}</ref> lived in ''tongkonans'', while commoners lived in less lavish houses (bamboo shacks called ''banua'').  Slaves lived in small huts, which had to be built around their owner's ''tongkonan''.  Commoners might marry anyone, but nobles preferred to [[consanguinity|marry in-family]] to maintain their status.  Sometimes nobles married Bugis or Makassarese nobles.  Commoners and slaves were prohibited from having death feasts.  Despite  close kinship and status inheritance, there was a some [[social mobility]], as marriage or change in wealth could affect an individual's status.<ref name="Waterson1986"/>  Wealth is counted by the ownership of [[water buffalo]]s, which will be slaughtered during his/her funeral feast.<!--Should this be in present tense? Unsure-->

Slaves in Toraja society were family property.  Sometimes Torajans decided to become slaves when they had a debt, pledging to work as payment.  Slaves could be owned during wars, and [[slave trade|slave trading]] was common.  Slaves could buy their freedom, but their children still inherited slave status. Slaves were prohibited from wearing bronze and gold, carving their houses, eating from the same dishes as their owners, or having sex with free women<U+2014>a crime [[capital punishment|punishable by death]].

===Religious affiliation===
Toraja's indigenous belief system is [[polytheistic]] [[animism]], called ''aluk'', or "the way" (sometimes translated as "the law"). In the Toraja myth, the ancestors of Torajan people came down from heaven using stairs., which were then used by the Torajans as a communication medium with ''Puang Matua'', [[Creator deity|the Creator]].<ref name="myth">This Toraja myth was directly translated from the history of Toraja at the official Tana Toraja website [http://www.toraja.go.id/sejarah.php toraja.go.id], retrieved on [[2007-05-18]].</ref>  The cosmos, according to ''aluk'', is divided into the upper world (heaven), the world of man (earth), and the underworld.<ref name="Nooy-Palm88"/>  At first, heaven and earth were married, then there was a darkness, a separation, and finally the light. Animals live in the underworld, which is represented by rectangular space enclosed by pillars; the earth is for mankind and the heaven world is located above, covered with a saddle-shaped roof. Other Toraja gods include ''Pong Banggai di Rante'' (god of Earth), ''Indo' Ongon-Ongon'' (a goddess who can cause earthquakes), ''Pong Lalondong'' (god of death), ''Indo' Belo Tumbang'' (goddess of medicine); there are many more.<ref name="philtar">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Toraja Religion|encyclopedia=Overview of World Religion|publisher=St. Martin College, UK|accessdate=2006-09-06|url=http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/indon/toraj.html}}</ref>

The authority, whose words and actions should be taken both in life ([[agriculture]]) and death ([[funerals]]), is called ''to minaa'' (an ''aluk'' [[priest]]).  ''Aluk'' is not just a [[belief system]]; it is a combination of law, religion, and habit.  ''Aluk'' governs social life, agricultural practices, and ancestral rituals.  The details of ''aluk'' may vary from one village to another.  One common law is the requirement that death and life rituals be separated.  Torajans believe that performing death rituals might ruin their corpses if combined with life rituals.<ref>  The death rituals are known as "smoke-descending" rituals, while the life rituals are "smoke-ascending" rituals; cf. Wellenkamp (1988).</ref>  The two rituals are equally important.  During the Dutch missionary works, Christian Torajans were prohibited from attending or performing life rituals, but were allowed to perform death rituals.<ref name="Ngelow2004"/>  Consequently, Toraja's death rituals are still practiced today, while life rituals have diminished.

==Culture==
===Tongkonan===
[[Image:Tongkonan1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A ''tongkonan'' with colorful decorations on the wall.]] 
{{main|Tongkonan}}
The ''tongkonan'' is the traditional Torajan house. It is an ancestral house standing high on wooden piles, covered on top with layered split [[bamboo]] roofs curving in sweeping arcs, incised with red, black, and yellow detailed wood carving ornaments at the exterior wall. The word "tongkonan" comes from the Toraja language's ''tongkon'' ("to sit"). 

''Tongkonan'' is the center of Toraja social life. The rituals associated with ''tongkonan'' are important expressions of Toraja spiritual life, and therefore all family members are impelled to participate, because symbolically ''tongkonan'' represents links to their ancestors and to living and future kin.<ref name="Volkman1984">{{cite journal| author=Volkman, Toby Alice| journal=American Ethnologist| title=Great Performances: Toraja Cultural Identity in the 1970s| volume=11 |issue=1 |date=February 1984 |url=    http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0094-0496%28198402%2911%3A1%3C152%3AGPTCII%3E2.0.CO%3B2-%23 |accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref> According to Torajan myth, the first ''tongkonan'' was built in heaven on four poles, with a roof made of [[India]]n cloth. When the first Torajan ancestor descended to earth, he imitated the house and held a large ceremony.<ref name="tongkonan">{{cite web|url=http://www.toraja.net/culture/arcitecture/index.html|title=Toraja Architecture|publisher = Ladybamboo Foundation|accessdate=2009-09-04}}</ref>

The construction of a ''tongkonan'' is laborious work and is usually done with the help of the extended family. There are three types of ''tongkonan''. The ''tongkonan layuk'' is the house of the highest authority, used as the "center of government".  The ''tongkonan pekamberan'' belongs to the family  members who have some authority in [[adat|local traditions]]. Ordinary family members reside in the ''tongkonan batu''. The exclusivity to the nobility of the ''tongkonan'' is diminishing as many Torajan commoners find lucrative employment in other parts of Indonesia. As they send back money to their families, they enable the construction of larger ''tongkonan''.

[[Image:TorajaArt.JPG|thumb|left|A Torajan wood carving: each panel symbolizes goodwill.]]

===Wood carvings===

The Toraja language is [[Spoken language|only spoken]]; no [[writing system]] exists.<ref name="Palmer2006"/> To express social and religious concepts, Torajans [[Wood carving|carve wood]], calling it ''Pa'ssura'' (or "the writing"). Wood carvings are therefore Toraja's cultural manifestation. 

Each carving receives a special name and common motifs are animals and plants that symbolize of some goodwill. For example, water plants and animals, such as [[crabs]], [[tadpoles]] and water [[weeds]], are commonly found to symbolize fertility. The left image shows an example of Toraja wood carving, consisting of 15 square panels. The center bottom panel represents buffalo or wealth, because they wish a lot of [[water buffalo|buffalos]] for their family. The center panel represents a knot and a box. It is a hope that all of their offspring will be happy and live in harmony, just like goods that are kept safe in a box.  The top left and top right squares represent an [[aquatic animal]], indicating the need for fast and hard work just like moving in the surface of water. It also represents the need for a certain skill to produce good results. 

Regularity and order are common features in Toraja wood carving (see table below), as well as abstracts and geometrical designs. Nature is frequently used as the basis of Toraja's ornaments, because nature is full of abstractions and geometries with regularities and ordering.<ref name="Palmer2006"/> Toraja's ornaments have been studied in [[ethnomathematics]] to reveal its mathematical structure, but Torajans make these arts only based on some approximations.<ref name="Palmer2006">{{cite conference |first= Miquel Alberti|last= Palmer|title= The Kira-kira method of the Torajan woodcarvers of Sulawesi to divide a segment into equal parts |booktitle= Third International Conference on Ethnomathematics: Cultural Connections and Mathematical Manipulations |date= 2006 |publisher = University of Auckland | location= Auckland, New Zealand |url= http://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~poisard/ICEm3/3.Prez%20Not%20Given/Prez%20not%20given%20papers/Alberti-paper.doc |format= [[DOC (computing)|doc]] |accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref>  To create an ornament, bamboo sticks are used as a geometrical tool.

===Funeral rites===
[[Image:Burial Site 2.jpg|thumb|right|A stone-carved burial site. ''Tau tau'' (effigies of the deceased) were put in the cave, facing down the land.]]
In Toraja society, the [[Funeral|funeral ritual]] is the most elaborate and expensive event.  The richer and more powerful an individual, the more expensive his or her funeral.  In the ''aluk'' religion, only nobles have the right to have an extensive death feast.<ref>In the present day, when tourism is the main income of the Torajans, funeral feasts have been held by non-noble rich families, mainly performed as tourist attractions. Volkman (1982) called this phenomenon a death funeral inflation.</ref> The death feast of a nobleman is usually attended by thousands and lasts for several days. A ceremonial site, called ''rante'', is usually prepared in a large area of grass field where shelters for audiences, rice barns, and other ceremonial funeral structures are specially made by the deceased family.

The ceremony is often held weeks, months, or years after the death so that the deceased family can raise the significant funds needed to cover funeral expenses.<ref>In 1992, the most powerful Torajan, the former chief of Tana Toraja Regency, died, and his family asked US$125,000 of a Japanese TV company as a license fee to film the funeral. Cf. Yamashita (1994).</ref>  Torajans traditionally believe that death is not a sudden, abrupt event, but a gradual process toward ''Puya'' (the land of souls, or [[afterlife]]).  During the waiting period, the body of the [[the dead|deceased]] is wrapped in several layers of cloth and kept under the ''tongkonan''.  The soul of the deceased is thought to linger around the village until the funeral ceremony is completed, after which it begins its journey to ''Puya''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=To the Afterworld and Back: Mourning and Dreams of the Dead among the Toraja|journal=Ethos|author=Hollan, Douglas|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0091-2131%28199512%2923%3A4%3C424%3ATTAABM%3E2.0.CO%3B2-E|volume=23|issue=4|pages=424&ndash;436|date=December 1995 |accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref>

Another component of the ritual is the slaughter of [[water buffalo]].  The more powerful the person who died, the more buffalo are slaughtered at the death feast.  Buffalo carcasses, including their heads, are usually lined on a field waiting for their owner, who is in the "sleeping stage". Torajans believe that the deceased will need the buffalo to make the journey, and that they will be quicker to arrive at ''Puya'' if they have many buffalo. Slaughtering tens of water buffalo and hundred of pigs using a [[machete]] becomes the peak of the elaborate death feast, along with dance, music and young boys who catch spurting blood in long [[bamboo]] tubes. Some of the slaughtered animals are given by guests as "gifts", which are carefully noted because they will be considered debts of the deceased family.<ref name="Yamashita1994">{{cite journal|last=Yamashita|first=Shinji|url=http://e-publishing.library.cornell.edu:80/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/seap.indo/1106970445|title=Manipulating Ethnic Tradition: The Funeral Ceremony, Tourism, and Television among the Toraja of Sulawesi|journal=Indonesia|volume=58|pages=69&mdash;82|date=October 1994|accessdate=2007-05-18}}

There are three methods of [[burial]]: the [[coffin]] may be laid in a cave, in a carved stone grave, or hung on a cliff. It contains any possessions that the deceased will need in the afterlife. The wealthy are often buried in a stone grave carved out of the rocky cliff. The grave is usually expensive and takes a few months to complete. In some areas, a stone cave may be found that is large enough to accommodate a whole family.  A wood-carved [[effigy]], called ''tau tau'', is usually placed in the cave facing down over the land.<!-- clarify --><ref>''Tau tau'' have been targeted by [[grave robbing|grave robbers]] for antique collectors. On several occasions, a stolen ''tau tau' effigy has appeared in an exhibition show; for instance, at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] in 1981 and at the Arnold Herstand Gallery in [[New York]] in 1984. Cf. Volkman (1990).</ref> The coffin of a deceased baby or child may be hung from ropes on a cliff face or from a tree. This hanging grave usually lasts for years, until the ropes rot and the coffin falls to the ground.

===Dance and music===
Torajans perform dances on several occasions, most often during their elaborate funeral ceremonies. They dance to express their grief, and to honour and even cheer the deceased person because he is going to have a long journey in the afterlife. First, a group of men form a circle and sing a monotonous chant throughout the night to honour the deceased (a ritual called ''Ma'badong'').<ref name="Yamashita1994"/><ref name="Sutton1995"/> On the second funeral day, the ''Ma'randing'' warrior dance is performed to praise the courage of the deceased during life. Several men perform the dance with a sword, a large shield made from buffalo skin, a helmet with a buffalo horn, and other ornamentation. The ''Ma'randing'' dance precedes a procession in which the deceased is carried from a rice barn to the ''rante'', the site of the funeral ceremony. During the funeral, elder women perform the ''Ma'katia'' dance while singing a poetic song and wearing a long feathered costume. The ''Ma'akatia'' dance is performed to remind the audience of the generosity and loyalty of the deceased person. After the bloody ceremony of buffalo and pig slaughter, a group of boys and girls clap their hands while performing a cheerful dance called ''Ma'dondan''.

As in other agricultural societies, Torajans dance and sing during [[harvest|harvest time]]. The ''Ma'bugi'' dance celebrates the [[thanksgiving]] event, and the ''Ma'gandangi'' dance is performed while Torajans are pounding [[rice]].<ref>{{cite website|url=http://www.batusura.de/dances.htm |title=Toraja Dances| publisher=www.batusura.de|accessdate=2007-05-02}}</ref> There are several [[Weapon dance|war dances]], such as the ''Manimbong'' dance performed by men, followed by the ''Ma'dandan'' dance performed by women. The ''aluk'' religion governs when and how Torajans dance. A dance called ''Ma'bua'' can be performed only once every 12 years. ''Ma'bua'' is a major Toraja ceremony in which priests wear a buffalo head and dance around a sacred tree.

A traditional musical instrument of the Toraja is a [[bamboo]]-made [[flute]] called ''Pa'suling'' (''[[suling]]'' is an [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] word for flute). This six-holed flute (not unique to Toraja) is played at many dances, such as the thanksgiving dance ''Ma'bondensan'',  where the flute accompanies a group of shirtless, dancing men with long fingernails. Toraja has endemic  musical instruments, such as the ''Pa'pelle'' (made from [[Arecaceae|palm]] leaves) and the ''Pa'karombi'' (the Toraja version of a [[Jew's harp]]). The ''Pa'pelle'' is played during harvest time and at house inauguration ceremonies.<ref>{{cite website|url=http://www.batusura.de/music.htm|publisher=www.batusura.de| title=Toraja Music| accessdate=2007-05-02}}</ref>

==Language==
The ethnic Toraja language is dominant in Tana Toraja, although the national [[Indonesian language]] is spoken in the community.<ref name="official"/>  All [[elementary school]]s in Tana Toraja teach Toraja language. [[Denominationalism|Denominations of the language]] include ''Kalumpang'', ''Mamasa'', ''Tae' '', ''Talondo' '', ''Toala' '', and ''Toraja-Sa'dan'', all forms of the [[Malayo-Polynesian]] language from the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] family.<ref name="gordon2005Toraja">{{cite book|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/web.asp|last=Gordon|first=Raymond G.|title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World|date=2005|publisher=Dallas, Tex.: SIL International|format=online version|accessdate=2006-10-17}}</ref> Each denomination has its own [[dialect]]s.

Toraja dialects have been influenced by other languages. <!--The Rongkong and Bua dialects of Tae', for instance, are a product a mixture between [[Bugis]], Tae' and [[Java]] languages.<ref name="taejournal">{{cite journal | title = Bahasa Tae' Luwu Masuki Dunia Ilmiah| journal = Palopo | publisher = JURnalCelebe | date = [[2005-05-11]] | url = http://www.jurnalcelebes.com/view.php?id=196&jenis=jurnal_adat|accessdate = 2006-10-16 }}</ref> --> The [[transmigration program]], introduced since the colonialism period, has been a major factor in the [[Variety (linguistics)|lingusitic variety]] of Toraja languages.<ref name="Sutton1995"/>

==Economy==
Prior to [[Suharto]]'s [[Orde Baru|"New Order"]] administration, the Torajan economy was based on agriculture, with cultivated wet [[rice]] in [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]]d [[fjord]]s on mountain slopes, and supplemental [[cassava]] and [[maize]] crops. Much time and energy were devoted to raising water buffalo, pigs, and chickens, primarily for ceremonial sacrifices and consumption.<ref name="Volkman1983">cf. Volkman (1983).</ref> The only agricultural industry in Toraja was a Japanese coffee factory, ''Kopi Toraja''.

With the commencement of the New Order in 1965, Indonesia's economy developed and opened to foreign investment. [[Multinational corporation|Multinational]] oil and mining companies opened new operations in Indonesia.  Torajans, particularly younger ones, relocated to work for the foreign companies: to [[Kalimantan]] for timber and oil, to [[Papua]] for mining, and to the cities of [[Sulawesi]] and [[Java]].  The [[out-migration]] of Torajans was steady until 1985.<ref name="Volkman1990">cf. Volkman (1990).</ref>

The Torajan economy gradually shifted to tourism beginning in 1984. Between 1984 and 1997, many Torajans obtained their incomes from tourism, by working in hotels as tour guides or selling souvenirs. With the rise of [[Reformation (Indonesia)|political and economic instability in Indonesia]] in the late 1990s<U+2014>including religious conflicts elsewhere on Sulawesi<U+2014>tourism in Tana Toraja has declined dramatically.

==Commercialization==

Before the 1970s, Toraja was almost unknown to Western tourism.  In 1971, about 50 Europeans visited Tana Toraja.  In 1972, at least 400 visitors attended the funeral ritual of Puang of Sangalla, the highest-ranking [[nobleman]] in Tana Toraja and the last pure-blood Toraja noble.  The event was documented by ''[[National Geographic]]'' and broadcast in several European countries.<ref name="Volkman1990"/>  In 1976, about 12,000 tourists visited the regency and in 1981, Torajan [[sculpture]] was exhibited in major North American museums.<ref name="Volkman1982">{{cite journal|last=Volkman|first=Toby|title=Tana toraja: A Decade of Tourism|url=http://209.200.101.189/publications/csq/csq-article.cfm?id=69|journal=Cultural Survival Quarterly|volume=6|issue=3|date=[[July 31]] [[1982]]|accessdate=2007-05-18 }}</ref>  "The land of the heavenly kings of Tana Toraja", as written in the exhibition brochure, embraced the outside world.

In 1984, the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism declared Tana Toraja Regency the ''prima donna'' of [[South Sulawesi]].  Tana Toraja was heralded as "the second stop after [[Bali]]".<ref name="Adams1995"/>  Tourism was increasing dramatically: by 1985, a total number of 150,000 foreigners had visited the Regency (in addition to 80,000 domestic tourists),<ref name="Adams1990">{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=Kathleen M.|title=Cultural Commoditization in Tana Toraja, Indonesia |url= http://209.200.101.189/publications/csq/csq-article.cfm?id=841 |journal= Cultural Survival Quarterly|volume=14|issue=1|date=[[January 31]] [[1990]]|accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref> and the annual number of foreign visitors was recorded 40,000 in 1989.<ref name="Volkman1990"/> Souvenir stands appeared in Rantepao, the cultural center of Toraja, roads were sealed at the most visited tourist sites, new hotels and tourist-oriented restaurants were opened, and an airstrip was opened in the Regency in 1981.<ref name="Volkman1984"/>

Tourism developers have marketed Tana Toraja as an exotic adventure<U+2014>an area rich in culture and off the beaten track. Western tourists expected to see stone-age villages and [[pagan]] funerals. Toraja is for tourists who have gone as far as Bali and are willing to see more of wild, "untouched" islands. However, they were more likely to see a Torajan wearing a hat and denim, living in a Christian society.<ref name="Volkman1990"/> Tourists felt that the ''tongkonan'' and other Torajan rituals had been preconceived to make profits, and complained that the destination was too commercialized. This has resulted in several clashes between Torajans and tourism developers, whom Torajans see as outsiders.<ref name="Adams1990"/>

A clash between local Torajan leaders with the [[South Sulawesi]] provincial government (as a tourist developer) surfaced in 1985. The government designated 18 Toraja villages and burial sites as traditional tourist objects. Consequently zoning restrictions were applied for these areas, such that Torajans themselves were barred from changing their ''tongkonans'' and burial sites.  The plan was opposed by some Toraja leaders, as they felt that their rituals and traditions were being determined by outsiders.  As a result, in 1987, the Toraja village K<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Kes<U+00FA> and several other designated "tourist objects" closed their doors to tourists.  This closure lasted only a few days, as the villagers found it too difficult to survive without the income from selling souvenirs.<ref name="Adams1990"/>

Tourism has also [[sociocultural evolution|transformed]] Toraja society.  Originally, there was a ritual which allowed commoners to marry nobles (''puang'') and thereby gain nobility for their children.  However, tourist imageries have made Torajans concealing their [[social status]].  High status is not as esteemed in Tana Toraja as it once was.  Many low-ranking citizens can declare themselves and their children nobles by gaining enough wealth through work outside the region, and then marrying a noble woman.<ref name="Adams1995"/>
