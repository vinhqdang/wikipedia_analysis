==Synopsis==
{{spoiler}}
[[Image:4f07.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Ned with Dr. Foster.]]
In midst of a quiet afternoon, the wind starts to pick up, which leads [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] to infer that a [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]] is on the way. The evening news confirms that 'Hurricane Barbara' is close, resulting in panicked citizens storming the [[Kwik-E-Mart]] and causing [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] to attempt to secure the Simpson home (albeit very badly). The hurricane strikes and after a few treacherous hours, the storm ends and the family cautiously leaves the basement. Initially, they are thankful to see that their home is untouched and Marge comments that everything works out if one has a little faith. Meanwhile, next door Flanders emerges from a heap of rubble and sees that his house was destroyed.

Ned is relieved that his family escaped serious injury, but it turns out to be little solace since he does not have any homeowners' [[insurance]]. The Flanders family is forced to move into the Rescue Center in the church basement, although they appear to be the only family be affected to that extent. Ned is further discouraged after learning that his business, the Leftorium, was [[looting|looted]] following the hurricane. Distraught with annoyance, Flanders begins to believe that God is punishing him and, seeking answers, he goes to read the Bible in the church but receives a [[papercut]]. Interpreting it as further punishment, he sits down and laments about how he is falling apart, even after doing everything the Bible says.

The following day, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] arrives at the church and takes the Flanders family back to their house, completely rebuilt by the people of Springfield. Overjoyed, Flanders inspects the house, but saddens after examining its extremely shoddy construction. The house soon collapses and Flanders snaps into a bout of rage, unleashing a torrent of insults over the residents of Springfield and directing his most vehement invective at Homer. In contrast, he then drives himself to Calmwood Mental Hospital to seek [[therapy]]. 

Whilst in the asylum, Flanders is visited by his childhood [[psychiatrist]], Dr. Foster who informs Ned of his childhood existence - an out-of-control brat raised by beatnik parents who didn't believe in discipline. As a result, the young Flanders went through the University of Minnesota Spankalogical Protocol which involved eight months of continuous [[spanking]]. The treatment worked so well that it rendered Flanders unable to express any anger at all and resulted in his trademark nonsensical jabbering at moments when he was particularly close to losing his temper. This caused Ned to unknowingly repress his anger until it built up inside him and erupted in his tirade of insults directed at the townspeople.

Dr. Foster enlists Homer to help Flanders learn how to appropriately express emotions as he is the person who Flanders harbors the most resentful feelings towards. After several failed generic remarks, Homer coaxes Flanders to admit that he hates the [[post office]] and his beatnik parents. Upon hearing this, Dr. Foster declares Flanders cured and he is immediately released.<ref name=officialsite/><ref name="Simpsguide">{{cite book|last=Martyn |first=Warren|coauthors=Adrian Wood|title=I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide |year=2000 |publisher=Virgin Books|id=ISBN 0-7535-0495-2|pages=}}</ref><ref name="SNPP">[http://www.snpp.com/episodes/4F03.html Episode Capsule] at The Simpsons Archive</ref><ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Richmond |first=Ray|coauthors=Antonia Coffman|title=[[The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to our Favorite Family]] |year=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|id=ISBN 0-00063-8898-1|pages=p. 173}}</ref>

Likewise, it inspired the idea that the neighbors would rebuild Flanders's house, but do a bad job and provoke an outburst.<ref name="Meyer"/>

==Reception==
Marge's line, "Dear God, this is Marge Simpson. If you stop this hurricane and save our family, we will be forever grateful and recommend you to all our friends," was cited by journalist Mark Pinsky as an example of how "Simpson family members are both defined and circumscribed by religion."<ref>Victoria Combe, "Praise and glory to the God-fearing Homer Simpson: Chaotic cartoon family criticized as dysfunctional is defined by religion, journalist says in book," ''Standard'', St. Catharines, Ontario: August 31, 2001, pg. A.1.FRO.</ref>  Journalist Ben Rayner speculated that some fans, whom he called "[[nerd]]s," would want an explanation of "how [[Barney Gumble|Barney]] fit through that tiny door to the 'master bedroom' in the rebuilt Flanders family home."<ref>Ben Rayner, "Offering up the goods on Springfield's finest; The Simpsons have breached the boundaries of animation. Today a director details how they do it, writes Ben Rayner," ''[[Toronto Star]]'', October 30, 2005, pg.
