'''Smoking cessation''' (colloquially '''quitting smoking''') is the process of discontinuing [[tobacco smoking]]. Tobacco contains [[nicotine]] that is [[substance dependence|addictive]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ped/content/ped_10_13x_guide_for_quitting_smoking.asp| title=Guide to quitting smoking| publisher=[[American Cancer Society]]| date=2011-01-31| accessdate=2011-02-15}}</ref>

Smoking cessation can be achieved with or without assistance from healthcare professionals, or the use of medications. However, a combination of personal efforts and medications proves more effective to many smokers.<ref name=Chapman-MacKenzie>{{cite journal|title=The global research neglect of unassisted smoking cessation: causes and consequences|author=Chapman S, MacKenzie R|date=2010-02-09|journal=PLoS Medicine|publisher=Public Library of Science|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000216|pmid=20161722|volume=7|issue=2|pages=e1000216|pmc=2817714}}</ref> Methods that have been found to be effective include interventions directed at or via health care providers and health care systems; medications including [[nicotine replacement therapy]] (NRT) and [[varenicline]]; individual and group counselling; and Web-based or stand-alone and computer programs.  Although stopping smoking can cause short-term side effects such as reversible weight gain, smoking cessation services and activities are cost-effective because of the positive health benefits.

* In a growing number of countries, there are more ex-smokers than smokers.<ref name=Chapman-MacKenzie>{{cite journal|title=The Global Research Neglect of Unassisted Smoking Cessation: Causes and Consequences|author=Chapman, Simon and MacKenzie, Ross|date=February 9, 2010|journal=PLoS Medicine|publisher=Public Library of Science|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000216|pmid=20161722|volume=7|issue=2|pages=e1000216|pmc=2817714}}</ref>
* Early "failure" is a normal part of trying to stop, and more than one attempt at stopping smoking prior to longer-term success is common.<ref name=Chapman-MacKenzie />
* NRT, other prescribed pharmaceuticals, and professional counselling or support also help many smokers.<ref name=Chapman-MacKenzie />
* However, up to three-quarters of ex-smokers report having quit without assistance ("cold turkey" or cut down then quit), and cessation without professional support or medication may be the most common method used by ex-smokers.<ref name=Chapman-MacKenzie/>

===Unassisted methods===
As it is common for ex-smokers to have made a number of attempts (often using different approaches on each occasion) to stop smoking before achieving long-term abstinence, identifying which approach or technique is eventually most successful is difficult; it has been estimated, for example, that "only about 4% to 7% of people are able to quit smoking on any given attempt without medicines or other help.".<ref name=ACS-success>{{cite web|title=Guide to quitting smoking.

===Cold turkey===
"[[Cold turkey]]" is a colloquial term indicating abrupt withdrawal from an addictive drug, and in this context indicates sudden and complete cessation of all nicotine use. In three studies, it was the quitting method cited by 76%,<ref name=Lee2007>{{cite journal |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.2005.083527 |author= Lee CW, Kahende J |year=2007|title=Factors associated with successful smoking cessation in the United States, 2000 |journal= Am J Public Health|volume=97 |issue= 8|pages=1503<U+2013>9 | pmid=17600268 |pmc= 1931453 }}</ref> 85%,<ref name=Fiore1990/> or 88%<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Doran CM, Valenti L, Robinson M, Britt H, Mattick RP | title = Smoking status of Australian general practice patients and their attempts to quit | journal = Addict Behav | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 758<U+2013>66 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.addbeh.2005.05.054 | pmid = 16137834 }}</ref> of long-term successful quitters. In a large British study of ex-smokers in the 1980s, before the advent of pharmacotherapy, 53% of the ex-smokers said that it was "not at all difficult" to stop, 27% said it was "fairly difficult", and the remaining 20% found it very difficult.<ref name=Chapman-MacKenzie />  Cold turkey methods have been advanced by J.

===Healthcare provider and systems===
Interventions delivered via healthcare providers and healthcare systems have been shown to improve smoking cessation among people who visit those providers.
* A clinic screening system (e.g., computer prompts) to identify whether or not a person smokes doubled abstinence rates, from 3.1% to 6.4%.<ref name=USDHHS2008/>{{rp|78<U+2013>79}} Similarly, the Task Force on Community Preventive Services determined that provider reminders alone or with provider education are effective in promoting smoking cessation.<ref name=Hopkins2001>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0749-3797(00)00297-X | author = Hopkins DP, Briss PA, Ricard CJ, Husten CG, Carande-Kulis VG, Fielding JE, Alao MO, McKenna JW, Sharp DJ, Harris JR, Woollery TA, Harris KW; Task Force on Community Preventive Services | title = Reviews of evidence regarding interventions to reduce tobacco use and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke | journal = Am J Prev Med | volume = 20 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = 16<U+2013>66 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11173215 | url = http://www.thecommunityguide.org/tobacco/tobac-AJPM-evrev.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|33<U+2013>38}}

* For one-to-one or person-to-person counselling sessions, the duration of each session, the total amount of contact time, and the number of sessions all correlated with the effectiveness of smoking cessation. For example, "Higher intensity" interventions (>10 minutes) produced a quit rate of 22.1% as opposed to 10.9% for "no contact"; over 300 minutes of contact time produced a quit rate of 25.5% as opposed to 11.0% for "no minutes"; and more than 8 sessions produced a quit rate of 24.7% as opposed to 12.4% for 0<U+2013>1 sessions.<ref name=USDHHS2008/>{{rp|83<U+2013>86}}

* According to the 2008 Guideline, based on two studies the training of clinicians in smoking cessation methods may increase abstinence rates<ref name=USDHHS2008/>{{rp|130}}; however, a Cochrane review found "a measurable effect" that such training decreased smoking in patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Carson KV, Verbiest ME, Crone MR, ''et al.'' |title=Training health professionals in smoking cessation |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=5 |issue= |pages=CD000214 |year=2012 |pmid=22592671 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000214.pub2 |editor1-last=Carson |editor1-first=Kristin V}}</ref>

===Biochemical feedback===
Various methods exist which allow a smoker to see the impact of their tobacco use, and the immediate effects of quitting.  Using biochemical feedback methods can allow tobacco-users to be identified and assessed, and the use of monitoring throughout an effort to quit can increase motivation to quit.<ref name="Bittoun">Bittoun R.  (2008). Carbon monoxide meter: The essential clinical tool- the <U+2018>stethoscope"-of smoking cessation.   Journal of Smoking Cessation, 3(2); 69-70.</ref><ref>Jamrozik K, Vessey M, Fowler G, Nicholas W, Parker G, and van Vunakis H.  (1984).  Controlled trial of three different anti-smoking interventions in general practice. ''British Medical Journal'', 288; 1499-1503.</ref>

* Breath carbon monoxide (CO) monitoring:  Because [[carbon monoxide]] is a significant component of cigarette smoke, a [[breath carbon monoxide monitor]] can be used to detect recent cigarette use.  Carbon monoxide concentration in breath has been shown to be directly correlated with the CO concentration in blood, known as percent [[carboxyhemoglobin]].  The value of demonstrating blood CO concentration to a smoker through a non-invasive breath sample is that it links the smoking habit with the physiological harm associated with smoking.<ref>Irving JM, Clark EC, Crombie IK, and Smith WC. (1988). Evaluation of a portable measure of expired-air carbon monoxide. Preventive Medicine, 17; 109-115.</ref> Within hours of quitting, CO concentrations show a noticeable decrease, and this can be encouraging for someone working to quit.  Breath CO monitoring has been utilized in smoking cessation as a tool to provide patients with biomarker feedback, similar to the way in which other diagnostic tools such as the stethoscope, the blood pressure cuff, and the cholesterol test have been used by treatment professionals in medicine.<ref name="Bittoun" />
* Cotinine:  A [[metabolite]] of nicotine, cotinine is present in smokers.  Like carbon monoxide, a cotinine test can serve as a reliable biomarker to determine smoking status.<ref>Florescu A, Ferrence R, Einarson T, Selby P, Soldin O, Koren G (February 2009). "Methods for quantification of exposure to cigarette smoking and environmental tobacco smoke: focus on developmental toxicology". Therapeutic Drug Monitoring 31 (1): 14<U+2013>30. .{{doi|10.1097/FTD.0b013e3181957a3b}} PMID 19125149.</ref> Cotinine levels can be tested through urine, saliva, blood, or hair samples, with one of the main concerns of cotinine testing being the invasiveness of typical sampling methods.

While both measures offer high sensitivity and specificity, they differ in usage method and cost. As an example, breath CO monitoring is non-invasive, while cotinine testing relies on a bodily fluid.  These two methods can be used either alone or together, for example, in a situation where abstinence verification needs additional confirmation.<ref>5.	McClure JB.  (2002). Are biomarkers useful treatment aids for promoting health behavior change? ''American Journal of Preventive Medicine'', 22 (3); 200-207.</ref>

===Single medications===
[[Image:Nicoderm.JPG||thumb|A 21mg dose [[Nicoderm]] CQ patch applied to the left arm.]]
The [[American Cancer Society]] estimates that "between about 25% and 33% of smokers who use medicines can stay smoke-free for over 6 months."<ref name=ACS-success/> Single medications include:
* [[Nicotine replacement therapy]] (NRT): Five medications approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) deliver nicotine in a form that does not involve the risks of smoking. NRTs are meant to be used for a short period of time and should be tapered down to a low dose before stopping.

Two other medications have been used in trials for smoking cessation, although they are not approved by the FDA for this purpose. They may be used under careful physician supervision if the first line medications are contraindicated for the patient.

===Combinations of medications===
The 2008 US Guideline specifies that three combinations of medications are effective<ref name=USDHHS2008/>{{rp|118<U+2013>120}}:
* Long-term nicotine patch and ''ad libitum'' NRT gum or spray
* Nicotine patch and nicotine inhaler
* Nicotine patch and bupropion (the only combination that the US FDA has approved for smoking cessation)

===Cut down to quit===
Gradual reduction involves slowly reducing one's daily intake of nicotine. This can theoretically be accomplished through repeated changes to cigarettes with lower levels of nicotine, by gradually reducing the number of cigarettes smoked each day, or by smoking only a fraction of a cigarette on each occasion. A 2009 systematic review by researchers at the [[University of Birmingham]] found that gradual nicotine replacement therapy could be effective in smoking cessation.<ref>{{cite news|author=Phend C|title=Gradual cutback with nicotine replacement boosts quit rates |url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/PrimaryCare/Smoking/13590|date=2009-04-03|publisher=MedPage Today|accessdate=2011-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | author = Moore D, Aveyard P, Connock M, Wang D, Fry-Smith A, Barton P | title = Effectiveness and safety of nicotine replacement therapy assisted reduction to stop smoking: systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = BMJ | volume = 338 | pages = b1024 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.b1024 | pmc = 2664870 | pmid = 19342408}}</ref> A 2010 Cochrane review found that abrupt cessation and gradual reduction with [[nicotine replacement therapy|pre-quit NRT]] produced similar quit rates whether or not pharmacotherapy or psychological support was used.

According to a more recent 2012 [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane]] [[systematic review]] analysis of 10 studies and 3670 patients, overall [[relative risk reduction]] between smokers who attempted to quit with abrupt cessation or with gradual reduction techniques was 0.06. This analysis demonstrated that there was no significant difference in quit rates between smokers who quit by gradual reduction or abrupt cessation as measured by abstinence from smoking of at least six months from the quit day, suggesting that patients who want to quit can choose between these two methods.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Lindson-Hawley N, Aveyard P, Hughes JR |title= Reduction versus abrupt cessation in smokers who want to quit|year=2012|issue=11| doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD008033.pub3|pmid=23152252|journal= Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|editor1-last= Lindson-Hawley|editor1-first= Nicola|volume= 11|pages= CD008033 }}</ref>

===Community interventions===
A Cochrane review found evidence that community interventions using "multiple channels to provide reinforcement, support and norms for not smoking" had an effect on smoking cessation outcomes among adults.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Secker-Walker RH, Gnich W, Platt S, Lancaster T | editor1-last = Stead | editor1-first = Lindsay F | title = Community interventions for reducing smoking among adults | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | issue = 3 | pages = CD001745 | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001745 | pmid = 12137631}}</ref> Specific methods used in the community to encourage smoking cessation among adults include:
* Policies making workplaces<ref name=Lee2007/> and public places smoke-free.

* [[Mass media]] campaigns. The US Task Force on Community Preventive Services declared that "strong scientific evidence" existed for these when "combined with other interventions"<ref name=Hopkins2001/>{{rp|30<U+2013>32}}, but a Cochrane review concluded that it was "difficult to establish their independent role and value".<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Bala M, Strzeszynski L, Cahill K | editor1-last = Bala | editor1-first = Malgorzata| title = Mass media interventions for smoking cessation in adults | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | issue = 1 | pages = CD004704 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004704.pub2 | pmid = 18254058}}</ref>

===Substitutes for cigarettes===
* [[Electronic cigarette]]: Shaped like a cigarette to emulate the tactile experience of smoking, electronic cigarettes contain a rechargeable battery and a heating element which vaporises liquid nicotine and other flavorings from an insertable cartridge.  Proponents of electronic cigarettes often market them as a smoking cessation device. Many claim that electronic cigarettes deliver the experience of smoking without the adverse health effects usually associated with tobacco smoke, or at least greatly reduce those risks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutelyecigs.com/blog/e-cigarette-excellent-subsitute-tobacco-cigarettes/|title=E-Cigarette <U+2013> An Excellent Subsitute to Tobacco Cigarettes|date=25 January 2012|publisher=AbsolutelyeCigs.com|accessdate=9 May 2012}}</ref>  However, in September 2008, the [[World Health Organization]] issued a release proclaiming that it does not consider the electronic cigarette to be a legitimate smoking cessation aid, stating that "no rigorous, peer-reviewed studies have been conducted showing that the electronic cigarette is a safe and effective [[nicotine replacement therapy]]."<ref name="WHO">{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2008/pr34/en/index.html|title=Marketers of electronic cigarettes should halt unproved therapy claims|accessdate=2011-02-21|date=2008-09-19|publisher=World Health Organization}}</ref>

*[[Smokeless tobacco]]: There is little smoking in Sweden, which is reflected in the very low cancer rates for Swedish men. Use of [[snus]] (a form of steam-pasteurised, rather than heat-pasteurised, air-cured smokeless tobacco) is an observed cessation method for Swedish men and even recommended by some Swedish doctors.<ref>{{Cite report | author = SCENIHR | title = Health Effects of Smokeless Tobacco Products | page = 103| url = http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/04_scenihr/docs/scenihr_o_009.pdf}}</ref>

==Special populations==

* Access reduction to tobacco
* Anti-tobacco media
* Family communication
A Cochrane review, mainly of studies combining motivational enhancement and psychological support, concluded that "complex approaches" for smoking cessation among young people show promise.<ref name=Grimshaw2006/> The 2008 US Guideline recommends counselling-style support for adolescent smokers on the basis of a meta-analysis of seven studies.<ref name=USDHHS2008/>{{rp|159<U+2013>161}}  Neither the Cochrane review nor the 2008 Guideline recommends medications for adolescents who smoke.

===Pregnant women===
[[Smoking and pregnancy|Smoking during pregnancy]] can cause adverse health effects in both the woman and the fetus.  The 2008 US Guideline determined that "person-to-person psychosocial interventions" (typically including "intensive counseling") increased abstinence rates in pregnant women who smoke to 13.3%, compared with 7.6% in usual care.<ref name=USDHHS2008/>{{rp|165<U+2013>167}} Mothers who smoke during pregnancy have a greater tendency towards premature births. Their babies are often underdeveloped,  have smaller organs, and weigh much less compared with the normal baby. In addition, these babies have worse immune systems, making them more susceptible to many diseases in early childhood, such as middle ear inflammations and asthmatic bronchitis which can bring about a lot of agony and suffering. As well, there is a high chance that they will become smokers themselves when grown up.

It is a widely spread myth that a female smoker can cause harm to her fetus by quitting immediately upon discovering that she is with child.  Though this idea does seem to follow logic, it is not based on any medical study or fact.<ref>{{cite web|last=Philip|first=Owen|title=Pregnancy and Smoking|url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/health_advice/facts/pregnantsmoking.htm|publisher=Net Doctor|accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref>

==Comparison of success rates==
Comparison of success rates across interventions can be difficult because of different definitions of "success" across studies.<ref name=ACS-success/>  Robert West and Saul Shiffman, authorities in this field recognised by government health departments in a number of countries <ref name=WestShiffman2007/>{{rp|73,76,80}}, have concluded that, used together, "behavioural support" and "medication" can quadruple the chances that a quit attempt will be successful.

A 2008 systematic review in the ''[[European Journal of Cancer Prevention]]'' found that group behavioural therapy was the most effective intervention strategy for smoking cessation, followed by [[bupropion]], intensive physician advice, nicotine replacement therapy, individual counselling, telephone counselling, nursing interventions, and tailored self-help interventions; the study did not discuss [[varenicline]].<ref name=Lemmens2008/>
[[File:Smoking insula.jpg|thumb|Individuals who sustained damage to the insula were able to more easily abstain from smoking.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Naqvi NH, Rudrauf D, Damasio H, Bechara A | title = Damage to the insula disrupts addiction to cigarette smoking | journal = Science | volume = 315 | issue = 5811 | pages = 531<U+2013>4 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1126/science.1135926 | pmid = 17255515 | pmc = 3698854 }}</ref>]]

==Factors affecting success==
Quitting can be harder for individuals with dark pigmented skin compared to individuals with pale skin since nicotine has an affinity for [[melanin]]-containing tissues. Studies suggest this can cause the phenomenon of increased [[Nicotine#Dependence|nicotine dependence]] and lower smoking cessation rate in darker pigmented individuals.<ref>{{Cite journal | author=King G, Yerger VB, Whembolua GL, Bendel RB, Kittles R, Moolchan ET | title = Link between facultative melanin and tobacco use among African Americans | journal = Pharmacol Biochem Behav | volume = 92 | issue=4 | pages = 589<U+2013>96 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.pbb.2009.02.011 | pmid = 19268687 | url = http://chicago.medicine.uic.edu/UserFiles/Servers/Server_442934/File/IHG/Kittleslab/documents/Melanin%20and%20Nicotine%20Article%20-%20Publication.pdf }}</ref>

There is an important social component to smoking. A 2008 study of a densely interconnected network of over 12,000 individuals found that smoking cessation by any given individual reduced the chances of others around them lighting up by the following amounts: a spouse by 67%, a sibling by 25%, a friend by 36%, and a coworker by 34%.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Christakis NA, Fowler JH| title=The collective dynamics of smoking in a large social network| journal=N Engl J Med| volume=358| issue=21| pages=2249<U+2013>58| year=2008| pmid=18499567| pmc=2822344| doi=10.1056/NEJMsa0706154 }}</ref><!--For preceding ref, pmc deleted because PubMed Central version is author manuscript, not final.--> Nevertheless, a [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane]] review determined that interventions to increase social support for a smoker's cessation attempt did not increase long-term quit rates.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Park EW, Schultz JK, Tudiver F, Campbell T, Becker L | editor1-last = Park | editor1-first = Eal Whan | title = Enhancing partner support to improve smoking cessation | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | issue = 3 | pages = CD002928 | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD002928.pub2 | pmid = 15266469 }}</ref>

Smokers who are trying to quit are faced with social influences that may persuade them to conform and continue smoking. Cravings are easier to detain when ones environment does not provoke the habit. If a person who stopped smoking has close relationships with active smokers they are often put into situations that make the urge to conform more tempting. However, in a small group with at least one other not smoking, the likelihood of conformity decreases. 
The social influence to smoke cigarettes has been proven to rely on simple variables. One researched variable depends on whether the influence is from a friend or non-friend.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02732173.2012.646163 |title=Friendship and Conformity in Group Opinions: Juror Verdict Change in Mock Juries |year=2012 |last1=Peoples |first1=Clayton D. |last2=Sigillo |first2=Alexandra E. |last3=Green |first3=Morgan |last4=Miller |first4=Monica K. |journal=Sociological Spectrum |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=178}}</ref> the research shows that individuals are 77% more likely to conform to non-friends, while close friendships decrease conformity.  Therefore, if an acquaintance offers a cigarette as a polite gesture, the person who has stopped smoking will be more likely to break his commitment than if a friend had offered.

Smokers with [[major depressive disorder]] may be less successful at quitting smoking than non-depressed smokers.<ref name=USDHHS2008/>{{rp|81}}<ref name=Glassman1990>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.1990.03450120058029 | author = Glassman AH, Helzer JE, Covey LS, Cottler LB, Stetner F, Tipp JE, Johnson J | title = Smoking, smoking cessation, and major depression | journal = JAMA | volume = 264 | issue = 12 | pages = 1546<U+2013>9 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2395194 }}</ref>

Giving up smoking is associated with an average weight gain of {{convert|4|-|5|kg|lb}} after 12 months, most of which occurs within the first three months of quitting.<ref>{{cite journal |author=H.-J. Aubin, A. Farley, D. Lycett, P. Lahmek, P. Aveyard. |title=Weight gain in smokers after quitting cigarettes: meta-analysis |journal=BMJ-British Medical Journal |issue=345|year=2012 |pmid= |doi=10.1136/bmj.e4439 |volume=345 |pages=e4439}}</ref>

The possible causes of the weight gain include:
* Smoking over-expresses the gene [[AZGP1]] which stimulates [[lipolysis]], so smoking cessation may decrease lipolysis.<ref name=Vanni2009>{{cite journal | title = Cigarette smoking induces overexpression of a fat-depleting gene AZGP1 in the human | journal=Chest | volume=135 | issue = 5 | pages=1197<U+2013>208 | year=2009 | pmid=19188554 | author=Vanni H, Kazeros A, Wang R, Harvey BG, Ferris B, De BP, Carolan BJ, H<U+00FC>bner RH, O'Connor TP, Crystal RG | doi = 10.1378/chest.08-1024 | pmc = 2679098 }}</ref>
* Smoking suppresses appetite, which may be caused by nicotine's effect on central [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] neurons (e.g., via regulation of [[melanin concentrating hormone]] neurons in the [[hypothalamus]]).<ref name=Jo2002>{{Cite journal | author = Jo YH, Talmage DA, Role LW | title = Nicotinic receptor-mediated effects on appetite and food intake | journal = J Neurobiol | volume = 53 | issue = 4 | pages = 618<U+2013>32 | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1002/neu.10147 | pmid = 12436425 | pmc = 2367209}}</ref>
* Heavy smokers are reported to burn 200 calories per day more than non-smokers eating the same diet.<ref>{{cite book|title= Johns Hopkins family health book|author=Klag MJ|year=1999|page=86|publisher=HarperCollins| location = New York| isbn=0-06-270149-5}}</ref> Possible reasons for this phenomenon include nicotine's ability to increase energy metabolism or nicotine's effect on peripheral neurons.<ref name=Jo2002/>

The 2008 Guideline suggests that sustained-release bupropion, nicotine gum, and nicotine lozenge be used "to delay weight gain after quitting."<ref name=USDHHS2008/>{{rp|173<U+2013>176}} However, a 2012 Cochrane review concluded that "The data are not sufficient to make strong clinical recommendations for effective programmes" for preventing weight gain.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Farley AC, Hajek P, Lycett D, Aveyard P |title=Interventions for preventing weight gain after smoking cessation |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=1 |pages=CD006219 |year=2012 |pmid=22258966 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006219.pub3 |volume=1 |editor1-last=Aveyard |editor1-first=Paul}}</ref>

===Depression===
Like other physically addictive drugs, nicotine withdrawal causes down-regulation of the production of dopamine and other stimulatory neurotransmitters as the brain attempts to compensate for artificial stimulation.  Therefore, when people stop smoking, depressive symptoms such as suicidal tendencies or actual depression may result.<ref name=Glassman1990/><ref>{{Cite journal | author = Covey LS, Glassman AH, Stetner F | title = Major depression following smoking cessation | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 154 | issue = 2 | pages = 263<U+2013>5 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9016279 }}</ref> This side effect of smoking cessation may be particularly common in women, as depression is more common among women than among men.<ref name=Borrelli1996>{{Cite journal | author = Borrelli B, Bock B, King T, Pinto B, Marcus BH| title = The impact of depression on smoking cessation in women | journal = Am J Prev Med | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 378<U+2013>87 | year =1996 | pmid = 8909649 }}</ref>

===Anxiety===
A recent study by [[The British Journal of Psychiatry]] has found that smokers who successfully quit feel less anxious afterwards with the effect being greater among those who had mood and anxiety disorders than those that smoked for pleasure.<ref name=bjp>{{cite journal | author = M<U+00E1>irt<U+00ED>n S.

==Health benefits==
Many of tobacco's detrimental health effects can be reduced or largely removed through smoking cessation. The health benefits over time of stopping smoking include:<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cancer.org/healthy/stayawayfromtobacco/guidetoquittingsmoking/guide-to-quitting-smoking-benefits|title=When smokers quit -- What are the benefits over time? |author=American Cancer Society |date=2011-01-31 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}</ref>
* Within 20 minutes after quitting, [[blood pressure]] and [[heart rate]] decrease
* Within 12 hours, [[carbon monoxide]] levels in the blood decrease to normal
* Within 48 hours, nerve endings and sense of smell and taste both start recovering
* Within 3 months, [[Circulatory system|circulation]] and [[Spirometry|lung function]] improve
* Within 9 months, there are decreases in cough and shortness of breath
* Within 1 year, the risk of [[coronary disease|coronary heart disease]] is cut in half
* Within 5 years, the risk of [[stroke]] falls to the same as a non-smoker, and the risks of many cancers (mouth, throat, esophagus, bladder, cervix) decrease significantly
* Within 10 years, the risk of dying from [[lung cancer]] is cut in half,<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Peto R, Darby S, Deo H, Silcocks P, Whitley E, Doll R | title = Smoking, smoking cessation, and lung cancer in the UK since 1950: combination of national statistics with two case-control studies | journal = BMJ | volume = 321 | issue = 7257 | pages = 323<U+2013>9 | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.321.7257.323 | pmc = 27446 | pmid = 10926586 }}</ref> and the risks of larynx and pancreas cancers decrease
* Within 15 years, the risk of coronary heart disease drops to the level of a non-smoker; lowered risk for developing COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)

The [[British doctors study]] showed that those who stopped smoking before they reached 30 years of age lived almost as long as those who never smoked.<ref name="Doll 2004">{{cite journal |author=Doll R, Peto R, Boreham J, Sutherland I |title=Mortality in relation to smoking: 50 years' observations on male British doctors |journal=BMJ |volume=328 |issue=7455 |page=1519 |year=2004 |pmid=15213107 |pmc=437139 |doi=10.1136/bmj.38142.554479.AE }}</ref> Stopping in one's sixties can still add three years of healthy life.<ref name="Doll 2004"/>  A randomized trial from the U.S. and Canada showed that a smoking cessation program lasting 10 weeks decreased mortality from all causes over 14 years later.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Anthonisen NR, Skeans MA, Wise RA, Manfreda J, Kanner RE, Connett JE; Lung Health Study Research Group | title = The effects of a smoking cessation intervention on 14.5-year mortality: a randomized clinical trial | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 142 | issue = 4 | pages = 233<U+2013>9 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15710956 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-142-4-200502150-00005 }}</ref>

Another published study, "Smoking Cessation Reduces Postoperative Complications: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis," examined six randomized trials and 15 observational studies to look at the effects of preoperative smoking cessation on postoperative complications. The findings were: 1) taken together, the studies demonstrated decreased likelihood of postoperative complications in patients who ceased smoking prior to surgery; 2) overall, each week of cessation prior to surgery increased the magnitude of the effect by 19%. A significant positive effect was noted in trials where smoking cessation occurred at least four weeks prior to surgery; 3) For the six randomized trials, they demonstrated on average a relative risk reduction of 41% for postoperative complications.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/health/smoking-cessation-postoperative |title = Smoking Cessation Reduces Postoperative Complications |publisher = Journalist's Resource.org }}</ref>

== Cost-effectiveness ==
[[Image:Smokers-as-a-percentage-of-adult-pop.jpg|thumb|500px|Smokers as a percentage of the population for the United States, the Netherlands, Norway, Japan, and Finland.]]
[[Cost-effectiveness analysis|Cost-effectiveness analyses]] of smoking cessation activities have shown that they increase [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALYs) at costs comparable with other types of interventions to treat and prevent disease.<ref name=USDHHS2008/>{{rp|134<U+2013>137}}  Studies of the cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation include:
* In a 1997 U.S. analysis, the estimated cost per QALY varied by the type of cessation approach, ranging from group intensive counselling without nicotine replacement at $1108 per QALY to minimal counselling with nicotine gum at $4542 per QALY.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.278.21.1759 | author = Cromwell J, Bartosch WJ, Fiore MC, Hasselblad V, Baker T | title = Cost-effectiveness of the clinical practice recommendations in the AHCPR guideline for smoking cessation | journal = JAMA | volume = 278 | issue = 21 | pages = 1759<U+2013>66 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9388153 }}</ref>

==Statistical trends==
