'''Walter de Coutances''' (or '''Walter of Coutances'''<ref name=John42>Warren ''King John'' p. 42</ref> or '''Walter of Rouen'''<ref name=Puiset53>Scammel ''Hugh du Puiset'' p. 53</ref>) (died 16&nbsp;November 1207) was a medieval English [[Bishop of Lincoln]] and [[Archbishop of Rouen]].  He began his royal service in the government of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], serving as a vice-chancellor. He also accumulated a number of ecclesiastical offices, becoming successively [[canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Rouen Cathedral]], treasurer of Rouen, and [[Archdeacon of Oxford]]. King Henry sent him on a number of diplomatic missions, and finally rewarded him with the Bishopric of Lincoln in 1183. He did not remain there long, for he was translated to the archbishopric of Rouen in late 1184.

When [[Richard I of England|Richard I]], King Henry's son, became king in 1189, Coutances absolved Richard for his rebellion against his father and invested him as Duke of Normandy. He then accompanied Richard to Sicily as the king began the [[Third Crusade]], but events in England prompted Richard to send the archbishop back to England to mediate between [[William Longchamp]], the [[justiciar]] whom Richard had left in charge of the kingdom, and Prince [[John of England|John]], Richard's younger brother. Coutances succeeded in securing a peace between Longchamp and John, but further actions by Longchamp led to the justiciar's expulsion from England, replaced in his role by Coutances, even though he never formally used the title. He remained in the office until late 1193, when he was summoned to Germany by the king, who was being held in captivity there. Coutances became a hostage for the final payment of Richard's ransom on the king's release in February 1194.

Coutances took no further part in English government after returning from Germany. Instead he became involved in Norman affairs, including a dispute with Richard over the ownership of Andali, an archiepiscopal manor that Richard desired as a fortress. Eventually the archbishop surrendered it to the king in return for two other manors and the seaport of Dieppe. Richard went on to build the castle of [[Ch<U+00E2>teau Gaillard]] on the former archiepiscopal manor. After Richard's death, Coutances invested Prince John as Duke of Normandy, but was forced to pay 2,100 [[angevin pound]]s to secure contested rights from the new king. After John lost control of Normandy in 1204, the archbishop did not resist the new government of King [[Philip II of France]]. Coutances died in November 1207 and was buried in his cathedral.

==Early life==

Coutances was born in [[Cornwall]],<ref name=Spear8>Spear "The Norman Empire and the Secular Clergy" ''Journal of British Studies'' p. 8</ref> to Reinfeld and Gonilla. His brother was [[Roger fitzReinfrid]],<ref name=DNB>Turner "Coutances, Walter de (d. 1207)" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref>{{#tag:ref|It is possible that Roger was a brother-in-law instead of a brother. Roger is occasionally called Roger FitzReinfrey.<ref name=Duggan25>Duggan "Roman, Canon, and Common Law" ''Historical Research'' p. 25</ref>|group=notes}} a layman and royal justice during the reign of King Henry II of England.<ref name=Judiciary62>Turner ''English Judiciary'' p. 62</ref> Although the medieval chronicler and churchman [[Gerald of Wales]] related that his friend was descended from [[Troy|Trojan]] heroes who escaped the [[Sack of Troy]] and ended up in Cornwall, that was a flattering invention on Gerald's part. Coutances' family was of the knightly class, and probably from Normandy originally.<ref name=Curiales241>Turner "Changing Perceptions" ''Judges, Administrators and the Common Law'' p. 241</ref>

Coutances was usually given the title of ''magister'', which signified that he had received an education in a school; most likely he attended the [[University of Paris|schools of Paris]]. Gerald of Wales said that Coutances was dedicated to learning, and considered him to be a talented courtier.<ref name=DNB/>

==Service to King Henry==

Coutances started his career as a clerk to King Henry II of England in the royal chamber.<ref name=Loyn266>Loyn ''Constitutional History'' p. 266</ref> He probably owed the position to his brother, who was already in royal service.<ref name=DNB/> Coutances may have been associated with the [[House of Beaumont|Beaumont family faction]] at court before beginning work for the king, but this is not certain.<ref name=Peltzer1222>Peltzer "Henry II and the Norman Bishops" ''English Historical Review'' pp. 1222<U+2013>1225</ref>

By 1169 Coutances held a [[canon (priest)|canonry]] in Rouen Cathedral.<ref name=Spear8>Spear "Norman Empire" ''Journal of British Studies'' p. 8</ref> During the 1170s a group of royal clerks rose to prominence, among them Coutances, [[Walter Map]], [[Ralph Diceto]], [[John of Oxford]], [[Richard of Ilchester]], and [[Geoffrey Ridel]].<ref name=Kingship144>Joliffe ''Angevin Kingship'' pp. 144<U+2013>145</ref> Coutances was the chaplain to [[Henry the Young King]], eldest living son of King Henry, but when the younger Henry [[Revolt of 1173<U+2013>1174|rebelled]] against his father in 1173, Coutances returned to King Henry's service.<ref name=Arnulf116>Schriber ''Dilemma of Arnulf of Lisieux'' p. 116</ref> He became [[Archdeacon of Oxford]], perhaps by 1173, certainly by 14 March 1176.<ref name=BHOArchDOxford>Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=33570 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: volume 3: Lincoln: Archdeacons of Oxford]''</ref> He was named vice-chancellor when Ralph de Warneville became [[Lord Chancellor of England|Chancellor]] of England,<ref name=DNB/> which occurred in 1173.<ref name=Handbook84>Fryde, et. al ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 84</ref> In 1176 and 1177, King Henry sent Coutances on diplomatic missions to Flanders and the French royal court.<ref name=DNB/> [[Arnulf of Lisieux|Arnulf]], the [[Bishop of Lisieux]], alleged that Henry allowed Coutances to use all the administrative machinery of Normandy to drive Arnulf from his diocese, so that Coutances might become bishop there.<ref name=Kingship208>Joliffe ''Angevin Kingship'' p. 208 footnote 4</ref> This happened in early 1178, but the only real evidence for this effort on Coutances' part comes from Arnulf's correspondence, and as Coutances was back in England by July 1178, it does not appear that the attempt was a sustained one.<ref name=Arnulf118>Schriber ''Dilemma of Arnulf of Lisieux'' pp. 118<U+2013>119</ref>

On his return to England, Coutances was given custody of the abbeys of [[Wilton Abbey|Wilton]] and [[Ramsey Abbey|Ramsey]], which were being held by King Henry pending the election of new abbots.<ref name=DNB/> He thus acquired the right to collect the abbeys' revenues in the name of the king, who had the [[regalian rights]] to that income.<ref name=Dict237>Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms and Phrases'' p. 237</ref> In 1180 Henry sent Coutances to France on another diplomatic mission.<ref name=Peltzer1222/> In February 1182 Coutances witnessed King Henry II's will, made before the king travelled to Normandy.<ref name=HenryII559>Warren ''Henry II'' p. 559 and footnote 4</ref>

==Bishop of Lincoln and Archbishop of Rouen==

Coutances was elected to the [[see of Lincoln]] on 8 May 1183,<ref name=Handbook255/> selected by King Henry over three other candidates.<ref name=DNB/> He was ordained a priest on 11 June 1183<ref name=DNB/> and consecrated bishop on 3 July 1183<ref name=Handbook255>Fryde, et. al ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 255</ref> at [[Angers]] by [[Richard of Dover]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref name=DNB/> He was enthroned at [[Lincoln Cathedral]] on 11 December 1183.<ref name=BHOLincoln>Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=33560 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: volume 3: Lincoln: Bishops of Lincoln]''</ref>  While at Lincoln, Coutances took part in the election of [[Baldwin of Exeter]] as the new Archbishop of Canterbury, which took place at a council held in Westminster in 1184. Writing about Coutances' time at Lincoln, Gerald of Wales accused the bishop of increasing the debt of the diocese of Lincoln and of squandering its resources.<ref name=DNB/> Coutances helped the schools in the city of Lincoln, acting as the patron for scholars such as [[John of Tynemouth]] and [[Simon of Southwell]].<ref name=Puiset70>Scammell ''Hugh du Puiset'' p. 70</ref>

On 17 November 1184 Coutances was [[Translation (ecclesiastical)|translated]] to the [[diocese of Rouen]], becoming [[Archbishop of Rouen]].<ref name=Handbook255/><ref name=BHOLincoln/> The original election to Rouen had taken place in the summer. King Henry had initially rejected the Rouen cathedral chapter's nominees and put forward three English bishops as the royal candidates. The king also indicated his preference that Coutances be elected, a choice that was confirmed by the pope in November. Coutances hesitated about the translation to Rouen, as the see there was poorer than Lincoln, but as an archbishopric rather than a bishopric it was of a higher status. The medieval chronicler [[William of Newburgh]] wrote that eventually Coutances' ambition overcame his greed, and he agreed to the translation.<ref name=DNB/>  Coutances remained in Henry's service however, and continued attend the royal court frequently. During the final 10&nbsp;years of Henry's reign, only Ranulf de Glanville witnessed more royal charters, and only Wiliam de Humez, the [[constable]], equaled the 16&nbsp;charters that Coutances witnessed.<ref name=Barre181>Turner "Richard Barre and Michael Belet" ''Judges, Administrators and the Common Law'' p. 181 footnote 4</ref>

In the later part of 1186, after the death of King Henry's son [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]] - who was Duke of Brittany - King [[Philip II of France]] demanded that Geoffrey's daughters be placed in the French king's custody, and that the [[duchy of Brittany]], which Geoffrey had ruled in right of his wife, be surrendered into French royal custody. Coutances was one of the negotiators sent by King Henry to secure a settlement, but they had to settle for a temporary truce.<ref name=HenryII610>Warren ''Henry II'' p. 610</ref> In January 1188 Coutances took the cross when he pledged to go on Crusade along with King Henry and King Philip of France.<ref name=DNB/>

At [[Whitsun]] in 1189, Coutances was a member of a commission appointed by the papal legate [[John of Anagni]] to arbitrate the dispute between King Henry II of England and his son, Richard, who was supported by King Philip II of France. Henry and Richard's conflict stemmed from Richard's desire to secure his inheritance to the throne of England, which he believed his father was trying to give to his youngest brother, John. The commission met near Le Mans. Richard and Philip insisted that Richard should be married to Philip's sister [[Alys, Countess of the Vexin|Alice]], that Henry name Richard as Henry's heir, and that Richard's youngest brother John should go on crusade with Richard. Henry rejected those terms, and neither Philip nor Richard would negotiate, even under the legate's threat of an interdict on France.<ref name=Richard94>Gillingham ''Richard I'' pp. 94<U+2013>98</ref>

==Service to King Richard==

Shortly after Richard took the throne he sought absolution for his sins in rebelling against his father, from Baldwin of Exeter and Coutances. The two archbishop's absolved Richard in a ceremony in Sees.<ref name=Richard104>Gillingham ''Richard I'' p. 104</ref> Coutances also invested Richard as Duke of Normandy in a ceremony held in Rouen, before accompanying Richard to England, where he participated in the new king's coronation,<ref name=DNB/> on 3&nbsp;September 1189.<ref name=Handbook36>Fryde, et. al ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 36</ref>

In 1189 Coutances held an ecclesiastical synod which legislated, among other things, that the clergy should not hold secular offices, even though Coutances himself had held and continued to hold such offices.<ref name=Clerical163>Turner "Clerical Judges" ''Judges, Administrators and the Common Law'' p. 163</ref> On 9 November 1189 Richard appointed Coutances to a commission tasked with deciding the dispute between Baldwin of Exeter and the monks of his [[cathedral chapter]] over Baldwin's plan to create a church dedicated to [[Thomas Becket]], the murdered Archbishop of Canterbury, and to staff this church not with monks, but with [[canon (priest)|canons]].<ref name=Walter31>Young ''Hubert Walter'' pp. 31<U+2013>32</ref> The monks of Canterbury Cathedral objected to Baldwin's plan, fearing that it was part of a plot to transfer the right of election from the monastic cathedral chapter to the new church's canons.<ref name=Walter13>Young ''Hubert Walter'' p. 13</ref> Sitting on the commission with Coutances were [[Hugh de Puiset]] the [[Bishop of Durham]], [[Godfrey de Lucy]] the [[Bishop of Winchester]], [[Hubert Walter]] the [[Bishop of Salisbury]], [[Peter de Leia]] the [[Bishop of St David's]], [[Richard fitzNigel]] the [[Bishop of London|Bishop-elect of London]], [[William Longchamp]] the [[Bishop of Ely|Bishop-elect of Ely]] and some abbots. The commission travelled to Canterbury, and on 29 November 1189, managed to secure a compromise between the parties, which lasted until Hubert Walter, by then Archbishop of Canterbury, revived the plan. In the compromise, Baldwin agreed to give up the idea of a new monastic foundation around Canterbury and the monks agreed to submit to the archbishop's authority.<ref name=Walter31/>

When Richard left England in late 1189, the archbishop accompanied him to Normandy and then to Sicily, where Richard began the [[Third Crusade]]. In October 1190, Coutances was one of the negotiators between the city of Messina and the crusaders, and later was a guarantor of the peace treaty between [[Tancred of Sicily|Tancred]], the [[King of Sicily]] and King Richard. The archbishop was also appointed one of the treasurers of the crusading army.<ref name=DNB/>

While Richard was still in Sicily, word reached the king of the disputes between William Longchamp, whom Richard had left in England, and [[John of England|John]], Richard's younger brother. On 2 April 1191 Richard sent Coutances back from Sicily to England. The archbishop landed in England on 27 June, after a short detour to Rome.<ref name=Feudal374/> Coutances received a release from his crusading vow, and returned to England in the company of Richard's mother, Queen [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]].<ref name=DNB/> He had a number of royal documents authorizing him to settle the disputes, and on 28 July a settlement was reached that left Longchamp in control, although John still retained sufficient power to make Longchamp's grip on the government somewhat insecure. In September, however, Longchamp imprisoned Richard's bastard half-brother, [[Geoffrey, Archbishop of York]], who was attempting to return to England after having been banished by the king. The imprisonment renewed memories of the murder of Thomas Becket almost 20&nbsp;years earlier, and Geoffrey was quickly released. Longchamp was brought to a council, headed by Coutances and a number of the clerical and lay lords of England, which took place on 5 October 1191 at [[Lodden Bridge]] on the Thames River. Longchamp was deposed and exiled, largely because Coutances had a royal document ordering the magnates to obey Coutances' if the archbishop's advice was resisted by Longchamp, which it had been.<ref name=Feudal374>Barlow ''Feudal Kingdom of England'' pp. 374<U+2013>377</ref> Although the medieval chronicler [[Richard of Devizes]] accused Coutances of duplicity, and of trying to play both sides against the other, the evidence suggests that Coutances was genuinely trying to solve the dispute in the king's interest. Longchamp fled to Normandy, and he was excommunicated by Coutances.<ref name=DNB/>

==Acting Justiciar==
After Longchamp's exile Coutances was named head of a council of regency, which is sometimes equated to the post of [[Justiciar|Chief Justiciar]], although he never referred to himself as such nor is he titled that in any official document.<ref name=Handbook71/> Most modern historians, however, name him as justiciar.<ref name=DNB/><ref name=Judiciary65>Turner ''English Judiciary'' pp. 65<U+2013>66</ref><ref name=West75>West ''Justiciarship in England'' p. 75</ref> He held that power until about 25&nbsp;December 1193, when Hubert Walter was appointed Justiciar.<ref name=Handbook71>Fryde, et. al ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 71</ref>

Coutances had long experience in the [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]], but little experience with judicial matters. Most of his efforts while in the justiciarship were centred on raising Richard's ransom. As evidence of this emphasis on raising money, Coutances sent out few itinerant justices during his time in power. Six groups of justices were sent out in 1192, but in 1193 none were sent out, and even the justices based in Westminster held few sessions.<ref name=Judiciary65/>  Of those justices appointed, like his predecessor in the justiciarship, Coutances used justices from a wide range of backgrounds, and many of those sent out on itinerent rounds were local to the area, rather than the increasingly professional justices used under Coutances' successor Hubert Walter. The justiciarship during this period was less connected to justice and was more closely tied to the [[Exchequer]], or treasury of England, and most of the power in the office derived from its control of the Exchequer.<ref name=Heiser226>Heiser "Households of the Justiciars" ''Haskings Society Journal'' pp. 226<U+2013>228</ref>

A new note in Coutances' administration was his custom of issuing writs not in his own name, as had previously been the practice, but in the king's name. The archbishop also stressed that his decisions were made with the advice and consent of many of the leading nobles of the realm, as well as the [[Exchequer|barons of the Exchequer]]. This was a reaction against Longchamp's authoritarian method of government.<ref name=Lion130>Turner and Heiser ''Reign of Richard Lionheart'' pp. 130<U+2013>131</ref>

The archbishop supervised the election of a new Archbishop of Canterbury, as Baldwin of Exeter had died while on Crusade in 1190. Although both Longchamp and Coutances were considered as possible candidates and rivals for the see, the cathedral chapter of Canterbury elected the [[Bishop of Bath]], [[Reginald fitz Jocelin]] in November 1191. Reginald died a month later and the see remained vacant until March 1193, when the king's candidate, Hubert Walter, was elected.<ref name=DNB/>

During 1191 the citizens of the city of London managed to acquire from Coutances and Prince John the recognition that the city was self-governing, something they had been attempting to secure for a number of years. This however, was not the grant of a complete charter of liberties, which did not occur until 1199.<ref name=Lyon277>Lyon ''Constitutional History'' p. 277</ref> In February 1193 Coutances summoned a council to Oxford, to address problems of administration and defence after the recently received news of Richard's captivity in Germany. The council also took oaths of fealty to Richard.<ref name=West77>West ''Justiciarship in England'' p. 77</ref> Prince John, however, hearing that Richard was in captivity, immediately went to France and swore homage to King Philip for Richard's lands, and then returned to England and raised a rebellion. Coutances proceeded to besiege [[Windsor Castle]], which was held by Prince John's men. When John heard that Richard was going to be freed, he left England and went to France.<ref name=Powicke95>Powicke ''Loss of Normandy'' p. 95</ref>

In February 1194 Coutances was in Germany, at the court of the German emperor, along with Longchamp, who brought letters to Richard, still in captivity. On 4&nbsp;February, Coutances became a hostage to the German emperor for the payment of the outstanding portion of Richard's ransom, and the king was released.<ref name=Richard247>Gillingham ''Richard I'' pp. 247<U+2013>248 and footnote 94</ref> The king never paid the final installment of his ransom, and the archbishop had to pay 10,000 [[mark (money)|marks]] for his own release.<ref name=DNB/> From that point onwards Coutances was no longer involved with English politics or government, and spent the rest of his career on Norman affairs.<ref name=Poole369>Poole ''Domesday Book to Magna Carta'' p. 369</ref> His record of charter witnessing bears this out; between 1189 and 1194 Coutances was among the most prolific of the witnesses to the king's English charters, but not after 1194.<ref name=Heiser234>Heiser "Households of the Justiciars" ''Haskings Society Journal'' p. 234</ref>

==Return to Normandy==

Coutances returned to Normandy, and in December 1195 attempted to secure compensation for the losses his archdiocese had sustained in the warfare between King Richard and King Phillip. He sought compensation from both kings but obtained no satisfaction, and felt so ill-treated by the kings that he abandoned his see.<ref name=Richard301/> The English and the French kings had required clergymen to guarantee the January 1196 [[Treaty of Louviers (1196)|Treaty of Louviers]] that the two kings arranged for themselves, with Richard nominating Coutances as his surety, or guarantor that the conditions of the treaty would be fulfilled. Part of the treaty laid out that if the archbishop laid an [[interdict]] or [[excommunicate]]d anyone in the lands of King Philip or any subject of King Richard in the archdiocese of Rouen, then the archiepiscopal manor of Andali should be forfeit to either king until after a special tribunal had determined if the archbishop's punishment was valid.<ref name=Powicke113>Powicke ''Loss  of Normandy'' pp. 113<U+2013>115</ref>

When Coutances returned to his diocese in July 1196, he found that the king had seized the manor of Andali independently of the treaty provisions, and when the archbishop refused to relinquish it to the king, Richard began to fortify the manor. He also built a castle there, now [[Chateau-Gaillard]]. On 7 November 1196, Coutances set off for Rome, to protest the seizure to the pope. Richard sent a royal embassy, and eventually a settlement was reached. The archbishop was ordered to remove the interdict he had placed on the duchy, and in return for the manor received two others and the seaport of [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]].<ref name=Richard301>Gillingham ''Richard I'' pp. 301<U+2013>304</ref> The various lands that Coutances' received in exchange for Andali were worth <U+00A3>1,405 a year.<ref name=Poole375>Poole ''Domesday Book to Magna Carta'' p. 375</ref> This episode marked the end of Coutances' service to the Angevin kings; for the rest of his life the archbishop focused on protecting and guarding the archiepiscopal properties and rights.<ref name=DNB/>

==Service to King John==

When Richard died on 6 April 1199,<ref name=Handbook36/> the archbishop invested Richard's youngest brother John as duke of Normandy on 25 April 1199. At the ceremony, John pledged to protect the Norman church, and soon afterwards confirmed the grant of Dieppe and the other manors to the archdiocese. John contested the right of the archbishop to some jurisdictional rights however, as well as forest rights, forcing Coutances to pay 2,100 angevin pounds in order to secure most of the contested rights. In May 1200, Coutances was involved in the peace treaty of Le Goulet between King John and King Philip of France, but took no active part in the Angevin defence of Normandy.<ref name=DNB/>

In September 1201 one of Coutances' [[suffragan bishop]]s, Lisiard, the [[Bishop of Sees]] died. King John objected when the cathedral chapter attempted to elect one of their own members as his successor. Coutances refused to recognise the result of the election, and the chapter divided into two parties, one favouring the elected chapter member, the other party another choice. Both parties appealed to the papacy, who eventually approved of the election of the [[Archdeacon of Sees]], Silvester. Coutances had the right to consecrate the bishop however, and he refused to do so, arguing that the king's choice had been disregarded. Pope [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] then ordered another Norman archbishop to consecrate Silvester, but the king refused to allow Silvester to take possession of his see. This led Innocent to order Normandy laid under an interdict, but eventually Silvester was allowed to take possession of Sees.<ref name=Govern339>Richardson and Sayles ''Governance of Mediaeval England'' pp. 339<U+2013>340</ref>

In May 1202 Pope Innocent III wrote to Coutances, urging him to impose religious punishments on any rebels against King John's rule in the duchy of Normandy.<ref name=Turner114>Turner ''King John'' p. 114</ref> When John lost the duchy in 1204, Coutances did not resist the government of King Philip II,<ref name=Turner94>Turner ''King John'' p. 94</ref> although he did not make his complete peace with Philip until March 1207.<ref name=Powicke264>Powicke ''Loss of Normandy'' p. 264</ref> In 1206<U+2013>1207, Coutances, along with his suffragan bishops, petitioned Philip for special legal procedures relating to patronage, which Philip granted.<ref name=Powicke277>Powicke ''Loss of Normandy'' p. 277</ref>

==As archbishop==

Although Coutances was absent from Rouen for most of the period between 1190 to 1194, he remained an active archbishop. He secured the continued immunity of clergy from secular jurisdiction, and supervised the administration of the archdiocese. He began the custom of keeping records in registers of episcopal judgements from about 1200, and he appointed the first officials of Rouen. He also oversaw the rebuilding of [[Rouen Cathedral]], which had begun in 1155, and restarted the work after a fire in 1200.<ref name=DNB/> His relations with his cathedral chapter were evidently excellent, as they remembered him as "a magnificent benefactor of the church of Rouen".<ref name=QDNB>Quoted in Turner "Coutances, Walter de (d. 1207)" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref>

==Death and legacy==

Coutances died on 16 November 1207 and was buried at Rouen Cathedral. The inventory of his personal possessions made after his death included a large number of jewels and vestments. He also owned a large library, which contained not only religious works but also legal texts on canon law and works of classical authors such as [[Juvenal]] and [[Ovid]].<ref name=DNB/>

Coutances' nephew, [[John of Coutances]], became [[Archdeacon of Oxford]] and [[Dean of Rouen]] under Walter's influence, and later [[Bishop of Worcester]].<ref name=BHOWorc>Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=33881 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: volume 2: Monastic cathedrals (northern and southern provinces): Bishops of Worcester]''</ref>{{#tag:ref|The election of John to Worcester in 1196 may have been an attempt by King Richard to mend his relationship with the archbishop, which had been damaged during the dispute over Andali.<ref name=English10>Turner "Richard Lionheart and English Episcopal Elections" ''Albion'' p. 10</ref>|group=notes}} Other nephews were William, successively a canon at Lincoln Cathedral and an archdeacon at Rouen, and Richard, also an archdeacon at Rouen.<ref name=Spear8/>

The historian [[John Gillingham]] called Coutances "one of the great fixers" of his time.<ref name=Richard111>Gillingham ''Richard I'' p. 111</ref> Two other historians have argued that it was probably Coutances' judgement and stability that persuaded the king to trust him.<ref name=Lion125>Turner and Heiser ''Reign of Richard Lionheart'' p. 125</ref>  The medieval poet [[John de Hanville]] dedicated a satirical poem on the tribulations of a poor scholar to Coutances.<ref name=Poole242>Poole ''Domesday Book to Magna Carta'' p. 242</ref>
