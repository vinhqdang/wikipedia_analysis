Established in 1336 by [[Harihara I]] and his brother [[Bukka Raya I]].<ref>Traditions in motion: religion and society in history By Supriya Varma, Satish Saberwal, Page no. 243 [http://books.google.com/books?id=S8EoAAAAYAAJ&q=vijaynagar+yadava&dq=vijaynagar+yadava&lr=&ei=s4doS9joA5TMlQSbhpGvCw&cd=30]</ref> The empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the southern powers against [[Islamic invasions of India|Islamic invasions]] by the end of the 13th century.<ref name="TNIE0702010">{{cite web |url=http://www.expressbuzz.com/edition/story.aspx?Title=Who%E2%80%99s+the+charioteer?&artid=yIB5oJW9JGg=&SectionID=f4OberbKin4=&MainSectionID=f4OberbKin4=&SEO=hampi,+festival&SectionName=cxWvYpmNp4fBHAeKn3LcnQ==|title=Who<U+2019>s the charioteer?|accessdate=2010-02-08}}</ref> It lasted until 1646 although its power declined after a major military defeat in 1565 by the [[Deccan sultanates]]. The empire is named after its capital city of [[Vijayanagara]], whose impressive ruins surround modern [[Hampi]], now a [[World Heritage Site]] in modern [[Karnataka]], [[India]]. The writings of medieval European travelers such as [[Domingo Paes]], [[Fern<U+00E3>o Nunes]]<ref>Robert Sewell, Fern<U+00E3>o Nunes, [[Domingo Paes|Domingos Paes]], "A forgotten empire: Vijayanagar; a contribution to the history of India" (Includes a translation of "Chronica dos reis de Bisnaga," from Domingos Paes and Fernao Nuniz from 1520 and 1535 respectively), Adamant Media Corporation, 1982, ISBN 0543925889</ref> and [[Niccol<U+00F2> Da Conti]] and the literature in local vernaculars provide crucial information about its history. Archaeological excavations at Vijayanagara have revealed the empire's power and wealth. 

The empire's legacy includes many monuments spread over South India, the best known being the group at [[Hampi]]. The previous temple building traditions in South India came together in the [[Vijayanagara Architecture]] style. The mingling of all faiths and vernaculars inspired architectural innovation of [[Hindu]] temple construction, first in the Deccan and later in the [[Dravidian architecture|Dravidian]] idioms using the local [[granite]]. Secular royal structures show the influence of the [[Sultanate of Delhi|Northern Deccan Sultanate]] architecture. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies like water management systems for irrigation. The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in the languages of [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Sanskrit]], while [[Carnatic music]] evolved into its current form. The Vijayanagara Empire created an epoch in South Indian history that transcended regionalism by promoting [[Hinduism]] as a unifying factor.

Differing theories have been proposed regarding the Vijayanagara empire's origins. Some claim that [[Harihara I]] and [[Bukka Raya I]], the founders of the empire, or [[Kuruba]] people first associated with the [[Kakatiya dynasty|Kakatiya]] kingdom who took control of the northern parts of the [[Hoysala Empire]] during its decline.<ref name="telguorigin">Robert Sewell (''A Forgotten Empire Vijayanagar: A Contribution to the History of India'', 1901), Nilakanta Sastri (1955), N.

Before the early 14th century rise of the Vijayanagara empire, the Hindu kingdoms of the Deccan, the [[Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri]], the [[Kakatiya dynasty|Kakatiya dynasty of Warangal]], the [[Pandyan Empire|Pandyan Empire of Madurai]], and the tiny kingdom of [[Kampili]] had been repeatedly invaded by [[Muslim]]s from the north, and by 1336 they had all been defeated by [[Alla-ud-din Khilji]] and [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]], the [[Sultanate of Delhi|Sultans of Delhi]]. The Hoysala Empire was the sole remaining Hindu kingdom in the path of the Muslim invasion.<ref name="onlykingdom">Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p216</ref> After the death of Hoysala [[Veera Ballala III]] during a battle against the Sultan of Madurai in 1343, the Hoysala empire merged with the growing Vijayanagara empire.

In the first two decades after the founding of the empire, Harihara I gained control over most of the area south of the Tungabhadra river and earned the title of ''Purvapaschima Samudradhishavara'' ("master of the eastern and western seas"). By 1374 Bukka Raya I, successor to Harihara I, had defeated the chiefdom of [[Arcot]], the [[Reddy dynasty]] of Kondavidu, the [[Madurai Sultanate|Sultan of Madurai]] and gained control over [[Goa]] in the west and the Tungabhadra-[[Krishna River]] [[doab]] in the north.<ref name="femalepoet">Kamath (2001), p162</ref><ref name="vijayama1">Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p317</ref> The original capital was in the [[principality]] of [[Anegondi]] on the northern banks of the Tungabhadra River in today's [[Karnataka]]. It was later moved to nearby Vijayanagara on the river's southern banks during the reign of Bukka Raya I.

With the Vijayanagara Kingdom now imperial in stature, [[Harihara II]], the second son of Bukka Raya I, further consolidated the kingdom beyond the [[Krishna River]] and brought the whole of South India under the Vijayanagara umbrella.<ref name="umbrella">The success was probably also due to the peaceful nature of Muhammad II Bahmani, according to Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p242</ref> The next ruler, [[Deva Raya I]], emerged successful against the [[Gajapatis]] of [[Orissa]] and undertook important works of fortification and irrigation.<ref name="aqueduct">From the notes of Portuguese Nuniz.

In the following decades the Vijayanagara empire dominated all of Southern India and fought off invasions from the five established [[Deccan Sultanates]].<ref name="civilization">Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p239</ref><ref name="civilization1">Kamath (2001), p159</ref> The empire reached its peak during the rule of [[Krishnadevaraya]] when Vijayanagara armies were consistently victorious.<ref name="perfect">From the notes of Portuguese traveler Domingo Paes about Krishnadevaraya: ''A king who was perfect in all things'' (''Hampi, A Travel Guide'' 2003, p31)</ref> The empire annexed areas formerly under the Sultanates in the northern Deccan and the territories in the eastern Deccan, including [[Kalinga (India)|Kalinga]], while simultaneously maintaining control over all its subordinates in the south.<ref name="richcity">The notes of Portuguese Barbosa during the time of Krishnadevaraya confirms a very rich and well provided Vijayanagara city (Kamath 2001, p186)</ref> Many important monuments were either completed or commissioned during the time of Krishnadevaraya.<ref name="dibba">Most monuments including the royal platform (''Mahanavami Dibba'') were actually built over a period spanning several decades (Dallapiccola 2001, p66)</ref> 

Krishnadevaraya was followed by [[Achyuta Raya]] in 1530 and in 1542 by [[Sadashiva Raya]] while the real power lay with [[Aliya Rama Raya]], the son-in-law of Krishnadevaraya, whose relationship with the Deccan Sultans who allied against him has been debated.<ref name="involve">Dr. P. B. Desai asserts that Rama Raya's involvement often was at the insistence of one Sultan or the other (Kamath 2001, p172).</ref> 

[[Image:Karnataka Hampi IMG 0730.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Virupaksha temple, [[Hampi]]]]
The sudden capture and killing of Aliya Rama Raya in 1565 at the [[Battle of Talikota]], against an alliance of the Deccan sultanates, after a seemingly easy victory for the Vijayanagara armies, created havoc and confusion in the Vijayanagara ranks, which were then completely routed. The Sultanates' army later plundered Hampi and reduced it to the ruinous state in which it remains; it was never re-occupied. Tirumala Raya, the sole surviving commander, left Vijayanagara for Penukonda with vast amounts of treasure on the back of 550 elephants.<ref name="venue1">Some scholars say the war was actually fought between Rakkasagi and Tangadigi in modern [[Bijapur district]], close to Talikota, and the battle is also called "Battle of Rakkasa-Tangadi". Shervani claimed that the actual venue of the battle was Bannihatti (Kamath 2001, p170)</ref> 

The empire went into a slow decline regionally, although trade with the Portuguese continued, and the British were given a land grant for the establishment of [[Madras]].<ref name="reviver">The Telugu work ''Vasucharitamu'' refers to Aravidu King Tirumala Raya (1570) as the ''reviver of the [[Karnata Empire]]''.

==Governance==
[[Image:Hampi natural fortress Dk.jpg|thumb|Natural fortress at [[Vijayanagara]]]]
[[Image:Vijayanagara royal insignia.jpg|thumb|right|Royal Insignia: The Boar, Sun, Moon and the Dagger]]
The rulers of the Vijayanagara empire maintained the well-functioning administrative methods developed by their predecessors, the Hoysala, Kakatiya and Pandya kingdoms, to govern their territories and made changes only where necessary.<ref name="waradmin">A war administration, (K.M. Panikkar in Kamath 2001, p174)</ref> The King was the ultimate authority, assisted by a cabinet of ministers (''Pradhana'') headed by the prime minister (''Mahapradhana''). Other important titles recorded in inscriptions were the chief secretary (''Karyakartha'' or ''Rayaswami'') and the imperial officers (''Adhikari''). All high ranking ministers and officers were required to have military training.<ref name="rank">From the notes of Persian Abdur Razzak and research by B.A. Saletore (Kamath 2001, p175)</ref> A secretariat near the king's palace employed [[scribes]] and officers to maintain records made official by using a [[wax seal]] imprinted with the ring of the king.<ref name="wax">From the notes of Nuniz (Kamath 2001, p175)</ref> At the lower administrative levels, wealthy feudal landlords (''Goudas'') supervised accountants (''Karanikas'' or ''Karnam'') and guards (''Kavalu''). The palace administration was divided into 72 departments (''Niyogas''), each having several female attendants chosen for their youth and beauty (some imported or captured in victorious battles) who were trained to handle minor administrative matters and to serve men of nobility as courtesans or concubines.<ref name="courtesans">Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p286</ref>

The empire was divided into five main provinces (''Rajya''), each under a commander (''Dandanayaka'' or ''Dandanatha'') and headed by a governor, often from the royal family, who used the native language for administrative purposes.<ref name="provinces">From the notes of Duarte Barbosa (Kamath 2001, p176). However, the kingdom may have had nine provinces (T.V. Mahalingam in Kamath 2001, p176)</ref> A ''Rajya'' was divided into regions (''Vishaya'' ''Vente'' or ''Kottam''), and further divided into counties (''Sime'' or ''Nadu'') themselves subdivided into municipalities  (''Kampana'' or ''Sthala''). Hereditary families ruled their respective territories and paid tribute to the empire while some areas, such as [[Keladi (India)|Keladi]] and  [[Madurai]], came under the direct supervision of a commander.

On the battlefields, the king's commanders led the troops. The empire's war strategy rarely involved massive invasions; more often it employed small scale methods such as attacking and destroying individual forts. The empire was among the first in India to use long range [[artillery]] commonly manned by foreign gunners. (Gunners from present day [[Turkmenistan]] were considered the best).<ref name="gunner">Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p287</ref> Army troops were of two types: The king's personal army directly recruited by the empire and the feudal army under each feudatory. King Krishnadevaraya's personal army consisted of 100,000 infantry, 20,000 cavalrymen and over 900 elephants. This number was only a part of the army numbering over 1.1 million soldiers, a figure that varied as an army of two million has also been recorded along with the existence of a navy as evidenced by the use of the term ''Navigadaprabhu'' (commander of the navy).<ref name="armysize">From the notes of Abdur Razzaq and Paes respectively (Kamath 2001, p176)</ref> The army recruited from all classes of society (supported by the collection of additional feudal tributes from feudatory rulers), and consisted of [[Archery|archers]] and [[musket]]eers wearing quilted [[tunic]]s, shieldmen with swords and [[poignard]]s in their girdles, and soldiers carrying shields so larges that no armour was necessary. The horses and elephants were fully armoured and the elephants had knives fastened to their tusks to do maximum damage in battle.<ref name="battle">From the notes of Nuniz (Nilakanta Sastri 1955, p288)</ref>

The capital city was completely dependent on the water supply systems constructed to channel and store water, and ensure a consistent supply throughout the year. The remains of these hydraulic systems have given historians a picture of the prevailing [[surface-water hydrology|surface water]] distribution methods in use at that time in South India's semiarid regions.<ref name="water">Davison-Jenkins (2001), p89</ref> Contemporary inscriptions and notes of foreign travelers describe how huge tanks were constructed by labourers.<ref name="water1">From the notes of Domingo Paes and Nuniz (Davison-Jenkins 2001, p98)</ref> Excavations have uncovered the remains of a well-connected water distribution system existing solely within the royal enclosure and the large temple complexes (suggesting it was for the exclusive use of royalty, and for special ceremonies) with sophisticated channels using gravity and [[siphon]]s to [[Water transportation|transport water]] through [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]].<ref name="water2">Davison-Jenkins (2001), p90</ref> The only structures resembling public waterworks are the remains of large water tanks that collected the seasonal monsoon water and then dried up in summer except for the few fed by springs. In the fertile agricultural areas near the [[Tungabhadra River]], canals were dug to guide the river water into [[irrigation tank]]s. These canals had [[sluice]]s that were opened and closed to control the water flow. In other areas the administration encouraged the digging of wells monitored by administrative authorities. Large tanks in the capital city were constructed with royal patronage while smaller tanks were funded by wealthy individuals to gain social and religious merit.

==Economy==
{{KarnatakaHistory}}
[[Image:Hampi Marketplace DK.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient Market place and plantation at [[Hampi]]]]
The empire's economy was largely dependent on agriculture. Corn (''jowar''), cotton and [[Pulse (legume)|pulse legumes]] grew in semi arid regions, while sugarcane, rice and wheat thrived in rainy areas. [[Betel|Betel leaves]], [[areca]] (for chewing), and coconut were the principal cash crops, and large scale cotton production supplied the weaving centers of the empire's vibrant textile industry. Spices such as [[turmeric]], pepper, [[cardamom]] and ginger grew in the remote [[Malnad]] hill region and were transported to the city for trade. The empire's capital city was a thriving business centre that included a burgeoning market in large quantities of precious gems and gold.<ref name="trade">From the notes of Duarte Barbosa (Kamath 2001, p181).</ref> Prolific temple-building provided employment to thousands of [[stone masonry|masons]], [[sculpture|sculptors]], and other skilled artisans.

Land ownership was important. Most of the growers were [[tenant farmer]]s and were given the right of part ownership of the land over time. Tax policies encouraging needed produce made distinctions between land use to determine tax levies. For example, the daily market availability of rose petals was important for perfumers, so cultivation of roses received a lower tax assessment.<ref name="rose">From the notes of Abdur Razzak in Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p298</ref> Salt production and the manufacture of [[Salt pan (evaporation)|salt pans]] were controlled by similar means. The making of [[ghee]] (clarified butter), which was sold as an oil for human consumption and as a fuel for lighting lamps, was profitable.<ref name="Ghee">From the notes of Abdur Razzak in Nilakanta Sastry (1955), p299</ref> Exports to China intensified and included cotton, spices, jewels, semi-precious stones, ivory, rhino horn, ebony, amber, coral, and aromatic products such as perfumes. Large vessels from China made frequent visits, some captained by the Chinese Admiral [[Cheng Ho]], and brought Chinese products to the empire's 300 ports, large and small, on the [[Arabian Sea]] and the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The ports of [[Mangalore]], [[Honavar]], [[Bhatkal]], [[Barkur]], [[Cochin]], [[Cannanore]], [[Machilipatnam]] and [[Dharmadam]] were the most important.<ref name="ports">From the notes of Abdur Razzak in Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p304</ref> 

When merchant ships docked, the merchandise was taken into official custody and taxes levied on all items sold. The security of the merchandise was guaranteed by the administration officials. Traders of many nationalities ([[Arabs]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Gujar Khan|Guzerates]], [[Greater Khorasan|Khorassanian]]s) settled in [[Calicut]], drawn by the thriving trade business.<ref name="ports"/> Ship building prospered and [[keel]]ed ships of 1000&ndash;1200 ''bahares'' ([[burden]]) were built without decks by sewing the entire [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] with ropes rather than fastening them with nails. Ships sailed to the [[Red Sea]] ports of [[Aden]] and [[Mecca]] with Vijayanagara goods sold as far away as [[Venice]]. The empire's principal exports were pepper, ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, [[Cherry plum|myrobalan]], [[Tamarind|tamarind timber]], [[Golden Shower Tree|anafistula]], precious and semi-precious stones, pearls, musk, ambergris, rhubarb, aloe, cotton cloth and porcelain.<ref name="ports"/> Cotton yarn was shipped to [[Burma]] and indigo to Persia. Chief imports from [[Palestine]] were copper, quicksilver (mercury), vermilion, coral, saffron, coloured velvets, rose water, knives, coloured [[camlet]]s, gold and silver. [[Persia]]n horses were imported to Cannanore before a two week land trip to the capital. Silk arrived from China and sugar from [[Bengal]]. 

East coast trade hummed, with goods arriving from [[Golkonda]] where rice, millet, pulse and tobacco were grown on a large scale. Dye crops of indigo and [[chay root]] were produced for the weaving industry. A mineral rich region, [[Machilipatnam]]  was the gateway for high quality iron and steel exports. Diamond mining was active in the Kollur region.<ref name="iron">Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p305</ref> The cotton weaving industry produced two types of cottons, plain [[Calico (fabric)|calico]] and muslin (brown, bleached or dyed). Cloth printed with coloured patterns crafted by native techniques were exported to [[Java]] and the [[Far East]]. Golkonda specialised in plain cotton and [[Pulicat]] in printed. The main imports on the east coast were non-ferrous metals, camphor, porcelain, silk and luxury goods.<ref name="east coast">Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p306</ref>

===Social life===
{{TNhistory}}
[[Image:Vijayanagar snakestone.jpg|thumb|left|''[[N<U+0101>ga]]'' (snake) stone worship at Hampi]]
Most information on the social life in Vijayanagara empire comes from the writings of foreign visitors and evidence that research teams in the Vijayanagara area have uncovered. The [[Hindu caste system]] was prevalent and rigidly followed, with each caste represented by a local body of elders who represented the community. These elders set the rules and regulations that were implemented with the help of royal decrees. [[Untouchability]] was part of the caste system and these communities were represented by leaders (''Kaivadadavaru''). The Muslim communities were represented by their own group in coastal Karnataka.<ref name="wrestling">Kamath (2001), p179</ref> The caste system did not, however, prevent distinguished persons from all castes from being promoted to high ranking cadre in the army and administration. In civil life, by virtue of the caste system, [[Brahmin]]s enjoyed a high level of respect. With the exception of a few who took to military careers, most Brahmins concentrated on religious and literary matters. Their separation from material wealth and power made them ideal arbiters in local judicial matters, and their presence in every town and village was a calculated investment made by the nobility and aristocracy to maintain order.<ref name="intellectual">According to Sir Charles Elliot, the intellectual superiority of Brahmins justified their high position in society (Nilakanta Sastri 1955, p289)</ref> However, the popularity of low-caste scholars (such as [[Molla (poetess)|Molla]] and [[Kanakadasa]]) and their works (including those of [[Vemana]] and [[Sarvajna]]) is an indication of the degree of social fluidity in the society.

The practice of [[Sati (practice)|Sati]] was common, though voluntary, and mostly practiced among the upper classes. Over fifty inscriptions attesting to this have been discovered in the Vijayanagara principality alone. These inscriptions are called ''Satikal'' (Sati stone) or ''Sati-virakal'' (Sati [[hero stone]]). ''Satikals'' commemorated the death of a woman by entering into fire after the death of her husband while ''Sati-virakals'' were made for a woman who performed ''Sati'' after her husband's heroic death. Either way, the woman was raised to the level of a demi-goddess and proclaimed by the sculpture of a Sun and crescent moon on the stone.<ref name="virkal">Verghese (2001), p41</ref>

The socio-religious movements of the previous centuries, such as [[Lingayatism]], provided momentum for flexible social norms to which women were expected to abide. By this time [[South India]]n women had crossed most barriers and were actively involved in matters hitherto considered the monopoly of men, such as administration, business and trade, and involvement in the fine arts.<ref name="finearts">B.A. Saletore in Kamath (2001), p179</ref> [[Tirumalamba|Tirumalamba Devi]] who wrote ''Varadambika Parinayam'' and [[Gangadevi]] who wrote ''Madhuravijayam'' were among the notable women poets of the era.<ref name="femalepoet">Kamath (2001), p162</ref> Early Telugu women poets like [[Timmakka|Tallapaka Timmakka]] and Atukuri Molla became popular during this period. The court of the [[Nayaks of Tanjore]] is known to have patronised several women poets. The [[Devadasi system]] existed, as well as legalised prostitution relegated to a few streets in each city.<ref name="prostitute">Kamath, p180</ref> The popularity of harems amongst men of the royalty is well known from records. 

Well-to-do men wore the ''Petha''or ''Kulavi'', a tall [[turban]] made of silk and decorated with gold. As in most Indian societies, jewellery was used by men and women and records describe the use of anklets, bracelets, finger-rings, necklaces and ear rings of various types. During celebrations, men and women adorned themselves with flower garlands and used perfumes made of [[rose water]], [[civet]], [[musk]] or [[sandalwood]].<ref name="perfume">Kamath (2001), p. 180</ref> In stark contrast to the commoners whose lives were modest, the lives of the empire's kings and queens were full of ceremonial pomp in the court. Queens and princesses had numerous attendants who were lavishly dressed and adorned with fine jewellery, their daily duties being light.<ref name="sundry">From the writings of Portuguese Domingo Paes (Nilakanta Sastri 1955, p. 296)</ref>

Physical exercises were popular with men and wrestling was an important male preoccupation for sport and entertainment. Even women wrestlers are mentioned in records.<ref name="wrestling">Kamath (2001), p179</ref> Gymnasiums have been discovered inside royal quarters and records speak of regular physical training for commanders and their armies during peace time.<ref name="training">Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p296</ref> Royal palaces and market places had special arenas where royalty and common people alike amused themselves by watching matches such as cock fights, ram fights and wrestling between women.<ref name="training"/> Excavations within the Vijayanagara city limits have revealed the existence of various types of community-based activities in the form of engravings on boulders, rock platforms and temple floors, implying these were places of casual social interaction. Some of these games are in use today and others are yet to be identified.<ref name="games">Mack (2001), p39</ref>

The Vijayanagara kings were tolerant of all religions and sects as writings by foreign visitors show.<ref name="democracy">From the notes of Duarte Barbosa (Kamath 2001, p178)</ref> The kings used titles such as ''Gobrahamana Pratipalanacharya'' ("protector of cows") and ''Hindurayasuratrana'' ("upholder of Hindu faith") that testified to their intention of protecting Hinduism and yet were at the same time staunchly Islamicate in their court ceremonials and dress as Philip Wagoner points out in his 1996 article 'Sultan Among Hindu Kings' published in the Journal of Asian Studies. The Empire's founders Harihara I and Bukka Raya I were devout [[Shaiva]]s (worshippers of [[Shiva]]), but made grants to the  [[Vaishnava]] order of [[Sringeri]] with [[Vidyaranya]] as their patron saint, and designated ''[[Varaha]]'' (the boar, an [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]]) as their [[emblem]].<ref name="emb">Kamath (2001), p177</ref> It is also important to note here that over one-fourth of the archaeological dig found a "Islamic Quarter" not far from the "Royal Quarter." Nobles from Central Asia's Timurid kingdoms also came down to Vijayanagara. The later [[Saluva]] and [[Tuluva]] kings were Vaishnava by faith, but worshipped at the feet of Lord Virupaksha (Shiva) at Hampi as well as Lord [[Venkateshwara]] (Vishnu) at [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple|Tirupati]]. A Sanskrit work, ''Jambavati Kalyanam'' by King Krishnadevaraya, called Lord Virupaksha ''Karnata Rajya Raksha Mani'' ("protective jewel of [[Karnata Empire]]").<ref name="devata">Fritz & Michell, p14</ref> The kings patronised the saints of the [[dvaita]] order (philosophy of dualism) of [[Madhvacharya]] at [[Udupi]].<ref name="patron">Kamath (2001), p177<U+2013>178</ref>

The [[Bhakti]] (devotional) movement was active during this time, and involved well known [[Haridasa]]s (devotee saints) of that time. Like the [[Virashaiva]] movement of the 12th century, this movement presented another strong current of devotion, pervading the lives of millions. The haridasas represented two groups, the ''[[Vyasakuta]]'' and ''[[Dasakuta]]'', the former being required to be proficient in the [[Vedas]], [[Upanishads]] and other [[Darshanas]], while the ''Dasakuta'' merely conveyed the message of Madhvacharya through the Kannada language to the people in the form of devotional songs (''Devaranamas'' and ''Kirthanas''). The philosophy of Madhvacharya was spread by eminent disciples such as [[Naraharitirtha]], [[Jayatirtha]], [[Vyasatirtha]], [[Sripadaraya]], [[Vadirajatirtha]] and others.<ref name="yathi trayaru">Shiva Prakash in Ayyappapanicker (1997), p192, pp194&ndash;196</ref> Vyasatirtha, the ''guru'' (teacher) of Vadirajatirtha, [[Purandaradasa]] (Father of Carnatic music<ref name="father10">Iyer (2006), p93</ref><ref name="father">Owing to his contributions to carnatic music, Purandaradasa is known as ''Karnataka Sangita Pitamaha''.

The defeat of the [[Jain]] [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] by the Cholas in early 11th century and the rising numbers of followers of Vaishnava Hinduism and Virashaivism in the 12th century was mirrored by a decreased interest in Jainism.<ref name="jain">Kamath (2001), pp.112, 132</ref> Two notable locations of Jain worship in the Vijayanagara territory were [[Shravanabelagola]] and [[Kambadahalli]].  

[[Islamic]] contact with South India began as early as the 7th century, a result of trade between the Southern kingdoms and  [[Arab]] lands. [[Jumma]] [[Masjid]]s existed in the Rashtrakuta empire by the 10th century<ref name="jumma">From the notes of Arab writer Al-Ishtakhri (Nilakanta Sastry 1955, p396)</ref> and many mosques flourished on the [[Malabar coast]] by the early 14th century.<ref name="jumma1">From the notes of Ibn Batuta (Nilakanta Sastri 1955, p396)</ref> Muslim settlers married local women; their children were known as Mappillas (''Moplahs'') and were actively involved in [[horse trading]] and manning shipping fleets. The interactions between the Vijayanagara empire and the Bahamani Sultanates to the north increased the presence of Muslims in the south. The introduction of [[Christianity]] began as early as the 8th century as shown by the finding of [[Indian copper plate inscriptions|copper plates]] inscribed with land grants to Malabar Christians. Christian travelers wrote of the scarcity of Christians in South India in the Middle Ages, promoting its attractiveness to missionaries.<ref name="mission">From the notes of Jordanus in 1320<U+2013>21 (Nilakanta Sastri 1955, p397)</ref> The arrival of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in the 15th century and their connections through trade with the empire, the propagation of the faith by [[Francis Xavier|Saint Xavier]] (1545) and later the presence of [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]] settlements fostered the growth of Christianity in the south.

===Literature===
{{Main|Vijayanagara Empire Literature}}
During the rule of the Vijayanagar Empire, poets, scholars and philosophers wrote in Sanskrit and the regional languages, Kannada, Telugu and Tamil and covered such subjects as religion, biography, ''Prabhanda'' (fiction), music, grammar, poetry and medicine. The Telugu language became a popular literary medium, reaching its peak under the patronage of [[Krishnadevaraya]].

Most Sanskrit works were commentaries either on the [[Vedas]] or on the  [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] epics, written by well known figures such as [[Sayana]] and Vidyaranya that extolled the superiority of the [[Advaita]] philosophy over other rival Hindu philosophies.<ref name="advaita">Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p321</ref> Other writers were famous [[Dvaita]] saints of the [[Udupi]] order such as Jayatirtha (earning the title ''Tikacharya'' for his polemicial writings), Vyasatirtha who wrote rebuttals to the Advaita philosophy and of the conclusions of earlier logicians, and Vadirajatirtha and Sripadaraya both of whom criticised the beliefs of [[Adi Sankara]].<ref name="critique">Nilakanta Sastry (1955), p324</ref> Apart from these saints, noted Sanskrit scholars adorned the courts of the Vijayanagara kings and their feudatory chiefdoms. Many kings of the dynasty were themselves litterateurs and authored classics such as King Krishnadevaraya's ''Jambavati Kalyana'', a poetic and dramatically skillful work.<ref name="jambavati">Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p318</ref>

The [[Kannada literature in Vijayanagara empire|Kannada poets and scholars of the empire]] produced important writings supporting the Vaishnava [[Bhakti]] movement heralded by the [[Haridasa]]s (devotees of Vishnu), [[Brahmin]]ical and Virashaiva ([[Lingayatism]]) literature. The ''[[Haridasa]]'' poets celebrated their devotion through songs called ''Devaranama'' (lyrical poems) in the ''ragale'' metre. Their inspirations were the teachings of Madhvacharya and Vyasatirtha. Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa are considered the foremost among many ''Dasas'' (devotees) by virtue of their immense contribution.<ref name="devaranama">Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p365</ref> [[Kumara Vyasa]], the most notable of Brahmin scholars wrote ''Gadugina Bharata'', a translation of the epic ''Mahabharata''. This work marks a transition of Kannada literature from old Kannada to modern Kannada.<ref name="brahminical">Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p364</ref>  [[Chamarasa]] was a famous Virashaiva scholar and poet who had many debates with Vaishnava scholars in the court of Devaraya II. His  ''Prabhulinga Lile'', later translated into Telugu and Tamil, was a eulogy of Saint [[Allama Prabhu]] (the saint was considered an incarnation of Lord [[Ganapathi]] while [[Parvati]] took the form of a princess of Banavasi).<ref name="ganapathi">Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p363</ref>
</s>

At this peak of [[Telugu people|Telugu]] literature, the most famous writing in the ''Prabhanda'' style was ''Manucharitamu''. King Krishnadevaraya was an accomplished Telugu scholar and wrote the celebrated ''Amuktamalyada''.<ref name="prabhanda">During the rule of Krishnadevaraya, encouragement was given to the creation of original ''Prabhandas'' (stories) from [[Puranic]] themes (Nilakanta Sastri 1955, p372)</ref> In his court were the eight famous scholars regarded as the pillars ([[Ashtadiggajas]]) of the literary assembly, the most famous being [[Allasani Peddana]] honoured with the title ''Andhrakavitapitamaha'' (father of Telugu poetry) and [[Tenali Ramakrishna]], Krishnadevaraya's court jester who authored several acclaimed works.<ref name="astadiggajas">Like the Nine gems of King Vikramaditya's court, the Ashtadiggajas of Krishnadevara's court are famous in legend (Nilakanta Sastri 1955, p372)</ref>  This was the age of [[Srinatha]], the greatest of all Telugu poets in legend, who wrote books like ''Marutratcharitamu'' and  ''Salivahana-sapta-sati''. He was patronised by King Devaraya II and his stature was equal to the most important ministers in the court.<ref name="salivahana">Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p370</ref> 

Though much of the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] literature from this period came from Tamil speaking regions ruled by the feudatory Pandya who gave particular attention on the cultivation of Tamil literature, some poets were patronised by the Vijayanagara kings. [[Svarupananda Desikar]] wrote an anthology of 2824 verses, ''Sivaprakasap-perundirattu'', on the Advaita philosophy. His pupil the ascetic, [[Tattuvarayar]], wrote a shorter anthology, ''Kurundirattu'', that contained about half the number of verses. Krishnadevaraya patronised the Tamil Vaishnava poet Haridasa whose ''Irusamaya Vilakkam'' was an exposition of the two Hindu systems, Vaishnava and Shaiva, with a preference for the former.<ref name="Tamil1">Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p347</ref>

Notable among secular writings on music and medicine were [[Vidyaranya]]'s ''Sangitsara'', [[Praudha Raya]]'s ''Ratiratnapradipika'', [[Sayana]]'s ''Ayurveda Sudhanidhi'' and [[Lakshmana Pandita]]'s ''Vaidyarajavallabham''.<ref>Prasad (1988), pp.268<U+2013>270</ref>

Vijayanagara architecture is a vibrant
combination of the [[Chalukya]], [[Hoysala]], [[Pandya]] and [[Chola]] styles, idioms that prospered in previous centuries.<ref name="blossom">Art critic, Percy Brown calls Vijayanagar architecture a blossoming of [[Dravidian architecture|Dravidian]] style (Kamath 2001, p182)</ref><ref name="blossom1">Arthikaje, ''Literary Activity''</ref>  Its legacy of sculpture, architecture and painting influenced the development of the arts long after the empire came to an end. Its stylistic hallmark is the ornate [[Column|pillar]]ed ''Kalyanamantapa'' (marriage hall), ''Vasanthamantapa'' (open pillared halls) and the ''Rayagopura'' (tower). Artisans used the locally available hard granite because of its durability since the kingdom was under constant threat of invasion. While the empire's monuments are spread over the whole of Southern India, nothing surpasses the vast open air theatre of monuments at its capital at [[Vijayanagara]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].<ref name="Stones">"So intimate are the rocks and the monuments they were used for make, it is was sometimes impossible to say where nature ended and art began" (Art critic Percy Brown, quoted in ''Hampi, A Travel Guide'', p64)</ref> 

In the 14th century the kings continued to build [[Vesara]] or Deccan style monuments but later incorporated dravida-style [[gopuram]]s to meet their ritualistic needs. The Prasanna Virupaksha temple (underground temple) of [[Bukka Raya I]] and the Hazare Rama temple of Deva Raya I are examples of Deccan architecture.<ref name="deccan">Fritz & Michell, p9</ref> The varied and intricate ornamentation of the pillars is a mark of their work.<ref name="pillar">Nilakanta Sastri about the importance of pillars in the Vijayanagar style in Kamath (2001), p183</ref> At Hampi, though the ''Vitthala'' temple is the best example of their pillared ''Kalyanamantapa'' style, the ''Hazara Ramaswamy'' temple is a modest but perfectly finished example.<ref name="Drama">"Drama in stone" wrote art critic Percy Brown, much of the beauty of Vijayanagara architecture came from their pillars and piers and the styles of sculpting (''Hampi, A Travel Guide'', p77)</ref> A visible aspect of their style is their return to the simplistic and serene art developed by the Chalukya dynasty.<ref name="serene">About the sculptures in Vijayanagara style, see Kamath (2001), p184</ref> A grand specimen of Vijayanagara art, the ''Vitthala'' temple, took several decades to complete during the reign of the Tuluva kings.<ref name="grand">Several monuments are categorised as Tuluva art (Fritz & Michell 2001, p9)</ref>

Another element of the Vijayanagara style is the carving of large [[monolithic|monoliths]] such as the ''Sasivekalu'' (mustard) [[Ganesha]] and ''Kadalekalu'' (Ground nut) Ganesha at Hampi, the [[Gomateshwara]] statues in [[Karkala]] and [[Venur]], and the [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] bull in [[Lepakshi]]. The Vijayanagara temples of [[Bhatkal]], [[Kanakagiri]], [[Sringeri]] and other towns of coastal Karnataka, as well as [[Tadpatri]], [[Lepakshi]], [[Ahobilam]], [[Tirupathi Venkateshwara Temple|Tirupati]] and [[Srikalahasti]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]], and [[Vellore]], [[Kumbakonam]], [[Kanchi]] and [[Srirangam]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] are examples of this style. Vijayanagara art includes wall-paintings such as ''Dasavathara'' (ten [[avatars]] of Vishnu) and ''Girijakalyana'' (marriage of Goddess [[Parvati]]) in the [[Virupaksha]] temple at Hampi, the ''Shivapurana'' paintings (tales of Shiva) at the [[Virabhadra]] temple at [[Lepakshi]], and those at the Jain ''basadi'' (temple) and the Kamaskshi and Varadaraja temple at Kanchi.<ref name="paint">Some of these paintings may have been redone in later centuries (Rajashekhar in Kamath 2001, p184)</ref> This mingling of the South Indian styles resulted in a richness not seen in earlier centuries, a focus on [[reliefs]] in addition to sculpture that surpasses that previously in India.<ref name="compliments">Historians and art critics K.A. Nilakanta Sastri, A. L. Basham, James Fergusson and S. K. Saraswathi have commented about Vijayanagara architecture (Arthikaje ''Literary Activity'').</ref>

An aspect of Vijayanagara architecture that shows the cosmopolitanism of the great city is the presence of many secular structures bearing Islamic features. While political history concentrates on the ongoing conflict between the Vijayanagara empire and the Deccan Sultanates, the architectural record reflects a more creative interaction. There are many [[arch]]es, [[dome]]s and [[Vault (architecture)|vault]]s that show these influences. The concentration of structures like [[Chhatri|pavilion]]s, [[stable]]s and [[tower]]s suggests they were for use by royalty.<ref name="deccanstyle">Fritz & Michell (2001), p10</ref> The decorative details of these structures may have been absorbed into Vijayanagara architecture during the early 15th century, coinciding with the rule of Deva Raya I and Deva Raya II. These kings are known to have employed many Muslims in their army and court, some of whom may have been [[Mughal architecture|Muslim architects]]. This harmonious exchange of architectural ideas must have happened during rare periods of peace between the Hindu and Muslim kingdoms.<ref name="harmony">Philon (2001), p87</ref> The "Great Platform" (''Mahanavami dibba'') has relief carvings in which the figures seem to have the facial features of central Asian Turks who were known to have been employed as royal attendants.<ref name="Turk">Dallapiccola (2001), p69</ref>
