[[Image:James Madison by Gilbert Stuart.jpg|thumb|[[James Madison]] envisioned ethical conflict, resulting in the [[United States Constitution]]'s [[Ineligibility Clause]], which later gave rise to the Saxbe fix.]]
The '''Saxbe fix''', or salary rollback, is a mechanism by which the [[President of the United States]], in appointing a current or former member of the [[United States Congress]] whose elected term has not yet expired, can avoid the restriction of the [[United States Constitution]]'s [[Ineligibility Clause]]. That clause prohibits the President from appointing a current or former member of Congress to a civil office position that was created, or to a civil office position for which the pay and/or benefits (collectively, "emoluments") were increased, during the term for which that member was elected until the term has expired. The rollback, first implemented by an [[Act of Congress]] in 1909, reverts the emoluments of the office to the amount they were when that member began his or her elected term.

To prevent ethical conflicts, [[James Madison]] proposed language at the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] that was adopted as the Ineligibility Clause after debate and modification by other [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]]. Historically, a number of approaches have been taken to address the problem posed by restriction; these have included choosing another nominee, allowing the desired nominee's elected term of office to expire, ignoring the clause entirely, or using a "Saxbe fix" to reduce the offending emoluments. Although Congress passed the latter mechanism in 1909, it is named for Senator [[William Saxbe]], who was confirmed as [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] in 1973 after Congress reduced the office's salary to the level it had been before Saxbe's term commenced. Since the late 1970s, the use of the "Saxbe fix" has been common. The Saxbe fix has subsequently become relevant as a successful<U+2014>though not universally accepted<U+2014>solution for appointments by presidents of both parties of sitting members of the United States Congress to the [[United States Cabinet]]. Members of Congress have been appointed to [[United States federal judge|federal judgeships]] without any fix being enacted; court challenges to such appointments have failed.

There were four Saxbe fixes for appointees of presidents prior to [[Barack Obama]]. The first two rollbacks concerned appointees of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] [[William Howard Taft]] and [[Richard Nixon]], and the latter two were implemented for appointees of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Bill Clinton]]. Congress approved two more in the weeks preceding Obama's presidency in preparation for his designated Cabinet nominees.<!--Another current nominee is in conflict with the clause and will need a Saxbe fix to be eligible for office.--> Since the 1980s, Saxbe fixes have only been temporary, extending to the conclusion of the term for which the sitting member of Congress was elected. The Clause has received relatively little scholarly or judicial attention; the sparse extant debate centers on whether the reduction of salary satisfies the Ineligibility Clause, or whether affected members of Congress are ineligible for appointment in spite of the reduction.

In his notes of the [[Philadelphia Convention]] in 1787, [[James Madison]] expressed the fear that members of Congress would create new federal jobs, or increase the salaries for existing jobs, and then take those jobs for themselves. Madison wrote that corrupt legislative actions, in the form of the unnecessary creation of offices and the increase of salaries for personal benefit, were one of his greatest concerns.<ref name=SpadotCaaP166>Yates, p. 166.</ref> The delegates who were present agreed that no member of Congress should be eligible to be appointed to an executive position while serving in Congress.<ref name=CI>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/LegalIssues/wm2149.cfm|title=Constitutional Ineligibility: What Does the Emoluments Clause Mean?|accessdate=2009-01-24|date=2008-12-03|publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]]|author=Forte, David F.}}</ref> Madison originally proposed a one-year length on such a bar.<ref name=SpadotCaaP169/> However, [[Nathaniel Gorham]], [[James Wilson]], and [[Alexander Hamilton]] wanted no bar at all at the conclusion of congressional service.<ref name=CI/> Eventually, Madison proposed a compromise: "that no office ought to be open to a member, which may be created or augmented while he is in the legislature"; this led to extensive debate.<ref name=CI/>

The delegates eliminated the prohibition on a member of Congress's assuming holding ''state'' office based on the rationale that there might be times when it might be in the best interest of the nation to allow such service. They eliminated the one-year ban because they judged it to be ineffective in protecting the Constitution.<ref name=CI/><ref name=SpadotCaaP>Yates, pp. 47<U+2013>48.</ref> [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] moved that the states vote and the prohibition carried by vote of 8 states to 3.<ref name=SpadotCaaP169>Yates, pp. 169<U+2013>172.</ref> [[Robert Yates (politician)|Robert Yates]] noted that the clause "which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased" was an amendment passed in his absence, and that he did not place much faith in it as he felt unscrupulous politicians would circumvent it by creating new positions for persons who would subsequently place a member of Congress in a vacancy that they and not Congress created.<ref name=SpadotCaaP/> Madison moved that the phrase "or the Emoluments whereof shall have been augmented by the legislature of the United States, during the time they were members thereof, and for one year thereafter." This motion failed 2<U+2013>8, with one state divided.<ref name=SpadotCaaP169/> The clause was limited to "civil" offices so as not to restrict military service.<ref name=CI/> Accordingly, the clause was passed in its current form without an explicit time consideration.

[[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 6: Compensation, privilege, restriction on holding civil office|Article 1, Section 6, Clause 2]] of the United States Constitution therefore prohibits self-dealing legislation and is intended to protect the "[[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution|separation of power]]" of the various branches of government.

The Ineligibility Clause has interfered with appointments as far back as 1793. [[United States President|President]] [[George Washington]] attempted to appoint [[William Paterson (judge)|William Paterson]] to the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] on February 27, 1793, after the resignation of [[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Associate Justice]] [[Thomas Johnson (Maryland)|Thomas Johnson]]. However, Paterson, who was serving as [[Governor of New Jersey]], had previously been elected to serve a Senate term that would expire at noon on March 4, 1793. Washington withdrew the nomination and withheld it until the afternoon of March 4, when the term for the disqualifying office had expired.<ref name=TEC104>O'Connor, J. p. 104</ref>

===19th century===
In 1882, a formal opinion by the [[Attorney General]] concluded that resignation from Congress does not free a member to be appointed to civil office because the clause speaks to the ''term'' for which a member was elected, and that term still exists, even if a member resigns.<ref name=AGBB/> Therefore, as in the Paterson matter nine decades earlier, [[Iowa Governor]] [[Samuel J. Kirkwood]], who had resigned a Senate seat with a term that did not expire until March 1883, was ineligible for appointment to the position of [[United States International Trade Commission|United States Tariff Commissioner]].<ref name=TEC103>O'Connor, J. p. 103</ref> In 1896, the [[Comptroller of the Treasury]] determined, after the fact, that former Senator [[Matthew Ransom]]'s appointment as Minister to Mexico was invalid, as that office's salary had been increased during Ransom's term; the belated discovery precluded Ransom from drawing a salary.<ref>See 2 Decisions of the Comptroller of the Treasury 135 (1896).</ref>

The practice of barring members of Congress from serving in other civil offices was not without exception. Ransom, after all, was in fact appointed.<ref name=KSBFtC/> In another case, there may have been an inadvertent Saxbe fix. Senator [[Lot M. Morrill]] began serving a six-year term in 1871, and in 1873, as part of the [[Salary Grab Act]], Congress increased Cabinet officers' salaries from $8,000 to $10,000; it repealed the increase in 1874, and two years later<U+2014>before the end of his term<U+2014>Morrill was appointed [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]]. The repeal of the "salary grab" was motivated by reaction to public outrage rather than concerns about a member's eligibility for office, but Acting United States Attorney General [[Robert Bork]] would later cite the Morrill case in his opinion about the Saxbe appointment.<ref name=TEC124-5>O'Connor, J. pp. 124<U+2013>125.</ref>

===20th century===
In 1909, [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] Taft announced his [[Philander C. Knox#Nomination controversy|intent to nominate]] Senator [[Philander C. Knox]] to be [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]].<ref>43 Congressional Record 2390-403 (1909).</ref> Shortly after the announcement, the ineligibility clause emerged as a problem that caught those involved by surprise:<ref name=KSBFtC/> Knox had been elected to serve a term that would not end until 1911, and during that term Congress had voted to increase executive branch pay.<ref name=KSBFtC>{{cite web| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9903E2D91031E733A25753C1A9649C946897D6CF| title=Knox Seems Barred From the Cabinet| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=1909-02-10|accessdate = 2009-01-25}}</ref><ref name="knox-1"/> Members of Congress considered reverting the fix after the appointed nominee had resigned and assumed the post so that Knox would not have to forgo any emoluments.<ref name=KSBFtC/> Members of Congress also discussed reverting the salaries of all United States Cabinet members.<ref name=KSBFtC/> At the suggestion of the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]], Congress passed a bill reducing only the Secretary of State's salary to the level it had been at before Knox's term began, believing this would cure the problem.

In 1922, the boundaries of the Clause were further defined when Senator [[William S. Kenyon (Iowa politician)|William S. Kenyon]] was allowed to accept an appointment by President [[Warren G. Harding]] as circuit judge for the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]].<ref name=TEC91>O'Connor, J. p. 91</ref> Attorney General [[Harry M.

The [[movant]] in the Black case, [[Albert Levitt]], only had an interest in the case as a United States Citizen and a member of the Supreme Court bar, which the Court found to be insufficient.<ref name=ToCL/>

The [[Nixon administration]] skirted the Ineligibility Clause during its first year, when Nixon named Representative [[Donald Rumsfeld]] as Director of the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]] in 1969. Although the salary for that office had been increased to $42,500 during Rumsfeld's term in Congress,<ref name="nyt110273"/> Rumsfeld was not paid a salary for the position. Rather, Rumsfeld was dually employed as [[Assistant to the President]] at the same $42,500 salary,<ref name="nyt110273"/> a position presumably outside the scope of the Clause.

The rollback device gained its name when President Richard Nixon sought to appoint Senator William Saxbe as Attorney General following the [[Saturday Night Massacre]].<ref name="fedtimes-k"/> [[Elliot Richardson]] resigned on October 20, 1973 and Nixon nominated Saxbe on November 1.<ref name=LaLE/> Saxbe was chosen in large part because, despite the confrontations of the ongoing [[Watergate scandal]], Nixon felt the Senate would want to confirm one of their own.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F60A12F7385D127A93CAA81789D95F478785F9| title=Senate, 75 to 10, Votes to Confirm Saxbe as Attorney General| author=Oelsner, Lesley| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| date=1973-12-18| accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref> Saxbe had been a senator in 1969 when the Congress passed a pay increase from $35,000 to $60,000 for Cabinet members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944652,00.html|title=Handing the Ball to Bill -Saxbe|accessdate=2008-11-24|date=1973-11-12|publisher=[[Time Inc]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|format=Article}}</ref> According to section 358 of title 2 of the [[United States Code]], "After considering the report and recommendations of the Commission submitted under section 357 of this title, the President shall transmit to Congress his recommendations with respect to the exact rates of pay, for offices and positions within the purview of subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) of section 356 of this title, which the President considers to be fair and reasonable ..."<ref name="usca-psc">{{cite book|title=United States Code Annotated|pages=80,88<U+2013>89|chapter=Public Service and Compensation|year=2005|publisher=Thompson/West}}</ref> The President transmitted "Salary Recommendations For 1969 Increases" to Congress on January 15, 1969 following the first Commission Report submitted to him under Public Law 90-206 in December 1968.

Although passage in the House was less controversial than it was in the Senate because the constitutional issues did not dominate consideration, the bill met with other procedural obstacles.

The House requested a conference, but the Senate delayed.

Thus, at first the House inserted franking language in its Saxbe fix bill. On December 3, it suspended its rules to pass the bill 261<U+2013>129. The Senate then passed the Saxbe fix bill (H.R. 11710) on December 6 without the franking language.

==Legality==
Over time, the Saxbe fix has become politically uncontroversial.<ref name="goldsworthy"/> Both Democratic and Republican Presidents have used the fix, and indeed Republican outgoing President George H. W. Bush helped Democratic incoming President Bill Clinton execute the fix by signing it into law on the eve of [[Bill Clinton 1993 presidential inauguration|Clinton's inauguration]]. The fixes that have been enacted for Obama's cabinet have passed in the both the House and the Senate without amendment and by unanimous consent.<ref name="thomas"/><ref name=Salazarfix/> Outgoing Republican President Bush signed the Saxbe fixes for both Clinton and Salazar into law for the incoming Democratic Obama administration.<ref name="thomas"/><ref name=Salazarfix/>

The constitutionality of the fix has been much debated, however, and the U.S. Supreme Court has never directly ruled on it.<ref name="goldsworthy">{{cite book| last=Goldsworthy| first=Jeffrey Denys| title=Interpreting Constitutions: A Comparative Study| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]| year=2006| isbn=0199274134| page=28}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last=Vermeule| first=Adrian| title=Mechanisms of Democracy: Institutional Design Writ Small| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]| year=2007| isbn=0195333462| page=54}}</ref> Critical review of the clause begins with a study of the terms in the plain language of the clause: "No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time ...." All of the terms have been at issue in past controversies and many of the terms have been well-settled.<ref name=TEC94>O'Connor, J. p. 94</ref> Historically, the excluded class of individuals affected by the clause has not been an issue: all scholars have agreed that the clause refers exclusively to all members of Congress.<ref name=TEC94/> The clause uses the verb "elected". If a senator serving under an appointment to fill a vacancy in an unexpired term accepted a nomination to federal office before the expiration of his or her term, this might be an issue.<ref name="schroeder"/>

The phrase "During the time for which he was elected" has not been controversial. [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Joseph Story]] has expounded in his ''Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States'' that the disqualifying event expires at the conclusion of the elected term in which it occurred.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_6_2s10.html Joseph Story|title=Commentaries on the Constitution|volume=2|pages=<U+00A7><U+00A7> 864--69|publisher=Carolina Academic Press|isbn=0-89089-314-4|year=1833 (reprinted 1987)}}</ref> This view is commonly accepted.<ref name=TEC101>O'Connor, J. p. 101.</ref> Moreover, [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] memoranda, outlining official opinions by United States Attorney General, hold that "the Ineligibility Clause covers only increases during the term that a Member of Congress is [or would be] currently serving".<ref name="schroeder"/> This principle was applied, for example, to the question of whether President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] could appoint Representative [[Bill Richardson]] as [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|Ambassador to the United Nations]] despite a salary increase prior to his current term, and whether President [[Warren G.

===Arguments for its constitutionality===
One way to interpret the clause is by the [[intentionalist]] view.<ref name=TEC146>O'Connor, J. p. 146</ref> As stated by [[University of North Carolina School of Law]] professor Michael J. Gerhardt, this is the position that "the critical inquiry is not whether the [[letter of the law]] has been broken (it has) but rather whether the problem that the clause exists to preclude<U+2014>conflicts of interest in nominating a member of Congress who has been able to vote himself or herself a raise<U+2014>has been avoided".<ref>{{cite book| last=Gerhardt| first=Michael J.| title=The Federal Appointments Process: A Constitutional and Historical Analysis| publisher=[[Duke University Press]]| year=2003| isbn=0822331993| page=162}}</ref> The commonly-used term for this [[spirit of the law]] argument is "net increases".<ref name=HMBU/> According to conservative constitutional law attorney [[Bruce Fein]], "The so-called fix fits the purpose of the clause like a glove."<ref name=SctCnj>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a8c8acc2-c165-11dd-831e-000077b07658.html?nclick_check=1|title=Salary clause threatens Clinton<U+2019>s new job|accessdate=2009-01-25|date=2008-12-03|publisher=The Financial Times Ltd|work=[[The Financial Times]]|author=Dombey, Daniel}}</ref>

If the Saxbe fix is a solution for the primary problem of self-dealing, a relevant fact is that Congress has not voted to increase any Cabinet salary or benefits since the 1990s, when it granted that power to the president in the form of an across-the-board [[cost of living adjustment]] by executive order. However, the Ineligibility Clause does not distinguish between increases in emoluments by legislation, and increases by executive order.<ref name=HMBU/> Perhaps the most lenient interpretation of self-dealing was made during the 1973 Saxbe hearings by [[Duke University School of Law]] professor William Van Alstyne, who argued that the ineligibility clause only applied to new offices created during a congressional term, not to appointments to existing offices.<ref name="wapo112073"/>

Some scholars think that the phrase "shall have been increased during such time" is ambiguous and allows different interpretations. For instance, it could be interpreted as meaning either "shall have been increased at least once" or "shall have been increased on net". In the latter case the Saxbe fix would be constitutional.<ref name=HCatEC/>

===Arguments against its constitutionality===
Another way to interpret the clause is through the lens of [[textualism]], that is, giving primary consideration to what the law says rather than to its purpose. Most legal scholars who take this view argue that the Saxbe fix does not address the constitutional problem.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Is Lloyd Bentsen Unconstitutional?|journal=Stanford Law Review|volume=46|page=907|year=1994|author=Paulsen, Michael S.}}</ref> Because to textualism believers the language of the rule is an absolute prohibition, law professor and textualist Michael Paulsen has said, a "'fix' can rescind the salary, ... but it cannot repeal historical events. The emoluments of the office had been increased. The rule specified in the text still controls."<ref name="firstread-2Nov08">{{cite web|url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/11/25/1688640.aspx|title=HRC, State <U+2014> and the Constitution|last=Williams|first=Pete|accessdate=2008-11-29|date=2008-11-25|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|work=First Read|format=Blog}}</ref> Most textualists agree that the spirit of the Ineligibility Clause would be addressed by a Saxbe fix, but they dispute that a clause's "spirit" overrides its text.<ref name=TEC156>O'Connor, J. p. 156.</ref><ref>See also (writing in another context) [[Frank Easterbrook]], ''What Does Legislative History Tell Us?'', 66 Chi.-Kent. L. Rev. 441 (1991): "laws have no 'spirit,' that they are complex compromises with limits and often with conflicting provisions, the proponents of which have discordant understandings."</ref>

This view is not confined to textualists; for example, law professors [[Jack Balkin]] and [[Mark Tushnet]] share it, with Tushnet observing that the Saxbe fix "smacks of clever manipulation" and does not adequately address the issue because "rescinding the increase does not mean that the salary 'shall not have been increased'; it simply means that the salary shall have been both increased and reduced during the term."<ref>{{cite book|first=Mark|last=Tushnet|title=Taking the Constitution Away from the Courts|pages=34<U+2013>5|year=2000|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=0691070350}}; [http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/16496?&in=12:17&out=19:50 video interview with Jack Bailkin]</ref> Some intentionalists interpret the Ineligibility Clause as a safeguard against escalation of the size and scope of the federal government and its corresponding budget, in addition to being a safeguard against self-enrichment. They argue that reverting salary increases does not prevent members of congress from engaging in conduct that would bloat the government.<ref name=HMBU>{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=9854|title=Hillary May Be Unconstitutional|accessdate=2009-01-24|date=2008-12-17|publisher=[[CATO Institute]]|work=[[The American Spectator]]|author=Shapiro, Ilya}}</ref>

Another argument presented during the Saxbe nomination hearings was that the constitutional framers wrote the Ineligibility Clause to prevent Congress from enacting laws to benefit one of its own members. Any Saxbe fix is such a law and should be disallowed based on this fact alone.<ref name=TEC130>O'Connor, J. p. 130</ref>

===Challenges===
Once Congress approves a salary reduction and the nominee is confirmed, legal experts conclude that in practice it is unlikely that an appointment would be successfully challenged in the courts. The most likely claimant would be an individual who has been adversely affected by a discretionary decision under the nominee's authority<U+2014>-for example someone denied a [[passport]].<ref name=HMBU/> It is unlikely that anyone would be found to have standing to contest the appointment. The Supreme Court has become less solicitous of standing since retreating from the most expansive level of ''[[United States v. SCRAP]]''. In particular, it has been unwilling to grant standing for a generalized constitutional injury other than to a plaintiff who is protected by a statute or when a statute grants standing.<ref name="firstread-2Nov08"/><ref>Justice [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|Brennan]] favored standing for any injury in fact, economic or otherwise. {{cite book|title=Constitutional Law|author=Nowak, John E. and Ronald D. Rotunda|publisher=West Publishing|edition=Sixth|isbn=0-314-23748-8|year=2000|pages=89<U+2013>91}}. Brennan saw standing as little more than a device for ensuring concrete averseness between the parties, see, e.g., [[Baker v. Carr]] (per Brennan, J.). But Justice Brennan left the court in 1990, and in cases like ''[[Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife]]'' and ''[[Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment]]'', the court has repudiated his version of standing.</ref>

It has already proven difficult to be recognized as having standing when a fix is not used for a controversial appointment. The courts have dismissed suits contesting the appointments of Justice [[Hugo Black]] (''[[Ex parte Levitt]]'', 302 U.S. 633 (1937)) and Judge [[Abner Mikva]] (''[[McClure v. Carter]]'', 454 U.S. 1025 (1981)), each a member of the Senate prior to appointment and each appointed without a Saxbe fix, due to failure to establish legal standing.<ref name=CI /> Other than these cases, most attempts to gain standing have been considered frivolous lawsuits brought by fringe groups.<ref name=SctCnj/>

===Precedents===
There are several nuances to the Ineligibility Clause that determine the necessity of fixes in specific situations:<ref name=CI/>
