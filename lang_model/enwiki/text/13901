'''Folding@home''' ('''FAH''' or '''F@h''') is a [[distributed computing]] project for disease research that simulates [[protein folding]], computational [[drug design]], and other types of [[molecular dynamics]]. The project uses the [[Idle (CPU)|idle processing resources]] of thousands of [[personal computers]] and [[PlayStation&nbsp;3]]s owned by volunteers who have installed the software on their systems. Its primary purpose is to determine the mechanisms of protein folding, which is the process by which [[protein]]s reach their [[protein tertiary structure|final three-dimensional structure]], and to examine the causes of [[protein misfolding]]. This is of significant academic interest with major implications for [[medical research]] into [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Huntington's disease]], and many forms of [[cancer]], among other diseases. To a lesser extent, Folding@home also tries to [[protein structure prediction|predict]] a protein's [[native state|final structure]] and determine how other molecules may [[Protein<U+2013>ligand docking|interact]] with it, which has applications in drug design. Folding@home is developed and operated by the Pande laboratory at [[Stanford University]], under the direction of [[Vijay Pande]], and is shared by various scientific institutions and research laboratories across the world.<ref name="About FAH"/>

The project has pioneered the use of [[GPU]]s, PlayStation&nbsp;3s, and [[Message Passing Interface]] (used for computing on [[multi-core processor]]s) for distributed computing and scientific research. The project uses statistical [[simulation]] methodology that is a [[paradigm shift]] from traditional computational approaches.<ref name="10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002"/> As part of the [[client-server]] [[network architecture]], the volunteered machines each receive pieces of a simulation (work units), complete them, and return them to the project's [[database server]]s where the units are compiled into an overall simulation. Volunteers can track their contributions on the Folding@home website, which makes volunteers' participation competitive and encourages long-term involvement.

Folding@home is one of the world's fastest computing systems, with a speed nearly equal to that of all projects running on the [[BOINC]] distributed computing platform. The project is the world's most powerful molecular dynamics simulator. This performance from its large-scale computing network has allowed researchers to run [[computationally expensive]] atomic-level simulations of protein folding thousands of times longer than previously achieved. Since its launch on October&nbsp;1, 2000, the Pande lab has produced 100&nbsp;[[Academic publishing|scientific research papers]] as a direct result of Folding@home.<ref name="papers"/> Results from the project's simulations agree favorably with experiments.<ref name="10.1021/ja9090353"/><ref name="10.1073/pnas.1003962107"/><ref name="10.1038/nature01160"/>

{{further | Protein folding}}
[[File:Protein folding.png|thumb|300px|A protein before and after folding. It starts in an unstable [[random coil]] state and finishes in its native state conformation.]]

[[Protein]]s are an essential component to many biological functions and participate in virtually all processes within [[cell (biology)|biological cell]]s. They often act as [[enzymes]], performing biochemical reactions including [[cell signaling]], molecular transportation, and [[Cell cycle#Regulation of eukaryotic cell cycle|cellular regulation]]. As structural elements, some proteins act as a type of [[cytoskeleton|skeleton for cells]], and as [[antibodies]], other proteins participate in the [[immune system]]. Before a protein can take on these roles, it must fold into a functional [[Protein tertiary structure|three-dimensional structure]], a process that often occurs spontaneously and is dependent on interactions within its [[amino acid]] sequence. Protein folding is driven by the search to find the most energetically favorable conformation of the protein, i.e. its [[native state]]. Thus, understanding protein folding is critical to understanding what a protein does and how it works, and is considered a "holy grail" of [[computational biology]].<ref name="10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000452"/><ref name="10.1126/science.309.5731.78b"/> Despite folding occurring within a [[macromolecular crowding|crowded cellular environment]], it typically proceeds smoothly. However, due to a protein's chemical properties or other factors, proteins may [[protein misfolding|misfold]]<U+2014>that is, fold down the wrong pathway and end up misshapen. Unless cellular mechanisms are capable of destroying or refolding such misfolded proteins, they can subsequently [[Protein aggregation|aggregate]] and cause a variety of debilitating diseases.<ref name="10.1002/iub.117"/> Laboratory experiments studying these processes can be limited in scope and atomic detail, leading scientists to use physics-based computational models that, when complementing experiments, seek to provide a more complete picture of protein folding, misfolding, and aggregation.<ref name="10.1016/j.abb.2007.05.014"/><ref name="10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.02.011"/>

Due to the complexity of proteins' [[configuration space|conformation space]]<U+2014>the set of possible shapes a protein can take<U+2014>and limitations in computational power, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been severely limited in the timescales which they can study. While most proteins typically fold in the order of milliseconds,<ref name="10.1016/j.abb.2007.05.014"/><ref name="10.1146/annurev.biophys.34.040204.144447"/> before 2010 simulations could only reach nanosecond to microsecond timescales.<ref name="10.1021/ja9090353"/> General-purpose [[supercomputer]]s have been used to simulate protein folding, but such systems are intrinsically expensive and typically shared between many research groups. Additionally, because the computations in kinetic models are serial in nature, strong [[scalability|scaling]] of traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult.<ref name="978-1-58603-796-3"/><ref name="10.1002/bip.10219"/> Moreover, as protein folding is a [[stochastic process]] and can statistically vary over time, it is computationally challenging to use long simulations for comprehensive views of the folding process.<ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006"/><ref name="10.1137/06065146X"/>

[[File:ACBP MSM from Folding@home.tiff|left|thumb|400px|Folding@home uses [[Markov state model]]s, like the one diagrammed here, to model the possible shapes and folding pathways a protein can take as it condenses from its initial randomly-coiled state (left) into its native 3D structure (right).]]
Protein folding does not occur in a single step.<ref name="10.1002/iub.117"/> Instead, proteins spend the majority of their folding time<U+2014>nearly 96% in some cases<ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2011.12.001"/><U+2014>"waiting" in various intermediate [[protein conformation|conformational]] states, each a local [[thermodynamic free energy]] minimum in the protein's [[energy landscape]]. Through a process known as [[adaptive sampling]], these conformations are used by Folding@home as starting points for a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of simulation trajectories. As the simulations discover more conformations, the trajectories are restarted from them, and a [[Hidden Markov model|Markov state model]] (MSM) is gradually created from this cyclic process. MSMs are [[discrete-time]] [[master equation]] models which describe a biomolecule's conformational and energy landscape as a set of distinct structures and the short transitions between them. The adaptive sampling Markov state model approach significantly increases the efficiency of simulation as it avoids computation inside the local energy minimum itself, and is amenable to distributed computing (including on [[GPUGRID]]) as it allows for the statistical aggregation of short, independent simulation trajectories.<ref name="Simulation FAQ"/> The amount of time it takes to construct a Markov state model is inversely proportional to the number of parallel simulations run, i.e. the number of processors available. In other words, it achieves linear [[parallelization]], leading to an approximately four [[orders of magnitude]] reduction in overall serial calculation time. A completed MSM may contain tens of thousands of sample states from the protein's [[phase space]] (all the conformations a protein can take on) and the transitions between them. The model illustrates folding events and pathways (i.e. routes) and researchers can later use kinetic clustering to view a course-grained representation of the otherwise highly-detailed model. They can use these MSMs to reveal how proteins misfold and to quantitatively compare simulations with experiments.<ref name="10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002"/><ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006"/><ref name="10.1021/ct900620b"/>

Between 2000 and 2010, the length of the proteins Folding@home has studied have increased by a factor of four, while its timescales for protein folding simulations have increased by six orders of magnitude.<ref name="typepad: how far FAH has come"/> In 2002, Folding@home used Markov state models to complete approximately a million [[CPU]] days of simulations over the span of several months,<ref name="10.1038/nature01160"/> and in 2011, MSMs parallelized another simulation that required an aggregate 10&nbsp;million CPU hours of computation.<ref name="10.1073/pnas.1010880108"/> In January 2010, Folding@home used MSMs to simulate the dynamics of the slow-folding 32-[[amino acid|residue]] NTL9 protein out to 1.52&nbsp;milliseconds, a timescale consistent with experimental folding rate predictions but a thousand times longer than previously achieved. The model consisted of many individual trajectories, each two orders of magnitude shorter, and provided an unprecedented level of detail into the protein's energy landscape.<ref name="10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002"/><ref name="10.1021/ja9090353"/><ref name="10.3390/ijms11125292"/> In 2010, Folding@home researcher Gregory Bowman was awarded the [[Thomas Kuhn#Thomas Kuhn Paradigm Shift Award|Thomas Kuhn Paradigm Shift Award]] from the [[American Chemical Society]] for the development of the [[open-source software|open-source]] MSMBuilder software and for attaining quantitative agreement between theory and experiment.<ref name="2010 KPS award"/><ref name="MSMBuilder source"/> For his work, Pande was awarded the 2012 Michael and Kate B<U+00E1>r<U+00E1>ny Award for Young Investigators for "developing field-defining and field-changing computational methods to produce leading theoretical models for protein and [[RNA]] folding"<ref name="Biophysical society names recipients"/> as well as the 2006 Irving Sigal Young Investigator Award for his simulation results which "have stimulated a re-examination of the meaning of both ensemble and single-molecule measurements, making Dr. Pande<U+2019>s efforts pioneering contributions to simulation methodology."<ref name="FAH Awards"/>

== Biomedical research ==
Protein misfolding can result in a [[proteopathy|variety of diseases]] including Alzheimer's disease, [[cancer]], [[Creutzfeldt<U+2013>Jakob disease]], [[cystic fibrosis]], Huntington's disease, [[sickle-cell anemia]], and [[type&nbsp;II diabetes]].<ref name="10.1002/iub.117"/><ref name="Protein Misfolding Diseases"/><ref name="diseases FAQ"/> Cellular infection by viruses such as [[HIV]] and [[influenza]] also involve folding events on [[cell membrane]]s.<ref name="978-0-340-66316-5"/> Once protein misfolding is better understood, therapies can be developed that augment cells' natural ability to regulate protein folding.  Such [[therapies]] include the use of engineered molecules to alter the production of a certain protein, help destroy a misfolded protein, or assist in the folding process.<ref name="10.1038/nature02265"/> The combination of computational molecular modeling and experimental analysis has the possibility of fundamentally shaping the future of molecular medicine and the [[drug design|rational design of therapeutics]],<ref name="10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.02.011"/> such as expediting and lowering the costs of [[drug discovery]].<ref name="10.1093/bib/bbp023"/> The goal of the first five years of Folding@home was to make advances in understanding folding, while the current goal is to understand misfolding and related disease, especially Alzheimer's disease.<ref name="Press FAQ"/>

The simulations run on Folding@home are used in conjunction with laboratory experiments,<ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006"/> but researchers can use them to study how folding ''[[in vitro]]'' differs from folding in native cellular environments. This is advantageous in studying aspects of folding, misfolding, and their relationships to disease that are difficult to observe experimentally. For example, in 2011 Folding@home simulated protein folding inside a [[ribosome|ribosomal]] exit tunnel, to help scientists better understand how natural confinement and crowding might influence the folding process.<ref name="forum: 7808/7809 to FAH"/><ref name="10.1073/pnas.0608256104"/> Furthermore, scientists typically employ chemical [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturants]] to unfold proteins from their stable native state. It is not generally known how the denaturant affects the protein's refolding, and it is difficult to experimentally determine if these denatured states contain residual structures which may influence folding behavior. In 2010, Folding@home used GPUs to simulate the unfolded states of [[Protein&nbsp;L]], and predicted its collapse rate in strong agreement with experimental results.<ref name="10.1021/ja908369h"/>

The Pande lab is part of Stanford University, a [[non-profit organization|non-profit entity]], and does not sell the results generated by Folding@home.<ref name="Main FAQ"/> The large data sets from the project are freely available for other researchers to use upon request and some can be accessed from the Folding@home website.<ref name="typepad: Simbios"/><ref name="papers for free"/> The Pande lab has collaborated with other molecular dynamics systems such as the [[Blue Gene]] supercomputer,<ref name="10.1038/sj.embor.7400108"/> and they share Folding@home's key software with other researchers, so that the algorithms which benefited Folding@home may aid other scientific areas.<ref name="typepad: Simbios"/> In 2011 they released the open-source Copernicus software, which is based on Folding@home's MSM and other parallelization techniques and aims to improve the efficiency and scaling of molecular simulations on large [[computer cluster]]s or supercomputers.<ref name="Pronk et al, 2011"/><ref name="Copernicus download"/> Summaries of all scientific findings from Folding@home are posted on the Folding@home website after publication.<ref name="papers"/>

=== Alzheimer's disease ===
[[File:Amyloid-plaque formation-big.jpg|550px|thumb|Alzheimer's disease is linked to the aggregation of amyloid beta protein fragments in the brain (right). Researchers have used Folding@home to simulate this aggregation process, to better understand the cause of the disease.]]

[[Alzheimer's disease]] is an incurable [[neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] disease which most often affects the elderly and accounts for more than half of all cases of [[dementia]]. Its exact cause remains unknown, but the disease is identified as a [[proteopathy|protein misfolding disease]]. Alzheimer's is associated with toxic [[protein aggregation|aggregations]] of the [[amyloid beta]] (A<U+03B2>) [[peptide]], caused by A<U+03B2> misfolding and clumping together with other A<U+03B2> peptides. These A<U+03B2> aggregates then grow into significantly larger [[senile plaques]], a pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease.<ref name="10.2119/2007-00100.Irvine"/><ref name="10.1001/archneurol.2007.56"/><ref name="10.1074/jbc.R800036200"/> Due to the heterogeneous nature of these aggregates, experimental techniques such as [[X-ray crystallography]] and [[NMR]] have had difficulty characterizing their structures. Moreover, atomic simulations of A<U+03B2> aggregation are extremely computationally demanding due to their size and complexity.<ref name="10.1063/1.3010881"/><ref name="10.1371/journal.pone.0021776"/>

Preventing A<U+03B2> aggregation is a promising approach to the development of therapeutic drugs for Alzheimer's disease, according to Drs. Naeem and Fazili in a [[literature review]] article.<ref name="10.1007/s12013-011-9200-x"/> In 2008, Folding@home simulated the dynamics of A<U+03B2> aggregation in atomic detail over timescales of the order of tens of seconds. Previous studies were only able to simulate about 10 microseconds<U+2014>Folding@home was able to simulate A<U+03B2> folding for six orders of magnitude longer than previously possible. Researchers used the results of this study to identify a [[beta hairpin]] that was a major source of molecular interactions within the structure.<ref name="10.1038/cr.2010.57"/> The study helped prepare the Pande lab for future aggregation studies and for further research to find a small peptide which may stabilize the aggregation process.<ref name="10.1063/1.3010881"/>

In December 2008, Folding@home found several small drug candidates which appear to inhibit the toxicity of A<U+03B2> aggregates.<ref name="typepad: possible alz. drug"/> In 2010, in close cooperation with the [[Center for Protein Folding Machinery]], these drug leads began to be tested on [[biological tissue]].<ref name="diseases FAQ"/> In 2011, Folding@home completed simulations of several [[mutation]]s of A<U+03B2> that appear to stabilize the aggregate formation, which could aid in the development of therapeutic drug approaches to the disease and greatly assist with experimental [[NMR spectroscopy]] studies of A<U+03B2> [[oligomer]]s.<ref name="10.1371/journal.pone.0021776"/><ref name="10.1021/jm201332p"/> Later that year, Folding@home began simulations of various A<U+03B2> fragments to determine how various natural enzymes affect the structure and folding of A<U+03B2>.<ref name="forum: 6871"/><ref name="description: 6571"/>

=== Huntington's disease ===
[[Huntington's disease]] is a neurodegenerative [[genetic disorder]] that is associated with protein misfolding and aggregation. [[Polyglutamine tract|Excessive repeats]] of the [[glutamine]] amino acid at the [[N-terminus]] of the [[Huntingtin protein]] cause aggregation, and although the behavior of the repeats is not completely understood, it does lead to the cognitive decline associated with the disease.<ref name="10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60111-1"/> As with other aggregates, there is difficulty in experimentally determining its structure.<ref name="10.1016/j.jmb.2009.01.032"/> Scientists are using Folding@home to study the structure of the Huntingtin protein aggregate and to predict how it forms, assisting with [[rational drug design]] approaches to stop the aggregate formation.<ref name="diseases FAQ"/> The N17 fragment of the Huntingtin protein accelerates this aggregation, and while there have been several mechanisms proposed, its exact role in this process remains largely unknown.<ref name="10.1038/nchembio.279"/> Folding@home has simulated this and other fragments to clarify their roles in the disease.<ref name="forum: 8021 in beta"/> Since 2008, its drug design approaches for Alzheimer's disease have been applied to Huntington's.<ref name="diseases FAQ"/>

=== Cancer ===
More than half of all known cancers involve [[mutations]] of [[p53]], a [[tumor suppressor]] protein present in every cell which regulates the [[cell cycle]] and signals for [[cell death]] in the event of damage to [[DNA]]. Specific mutations in p53 can disrupt these functions, allowing an abnormal cell to continue growing unchecked, resulting in the development of [[tumors]]. Analysis of these mutations helps explain the root causes of p53-related cancers.<ref name="10.1126/science.1905840"/> In 2004, Folding@home was used to perform the first molecular dynamics study of the refolding of p53's [[protein dimer]] in an [[water model|all-atom simulation of water]].  The simulation's results agreed with experimental observations and gave insights into the refolding of the dimer that were previously unobtainable.<ref name="10.1016/j.jmb.2004.10.083"/> This was the first [[peer review]]ed publication on cancer from a distributed computing project.<ref name="FAH publishes cancer results"/> The following year, Folding@home powered a new method to identify the amino acids crucial for the stability of a given protein, which was then used to study mutations of p53. The method was reasonably successful in identifying cancer-promoting mutations and determined the effects of specific mutations which could not otherwise be measured experimentally.<ref name="10.1016/j.jmb.2005.12.083"/>

Folding@home is also used to study [[chaperone (protein)|protein chaperones]],<ref name="diseases FAQ"/> [[heat shock protein]]s which play essential roles in cell survival by assisting with the folding of other proteins in the [[Macromolecular crowding|crowded]] and chemically stressful environment within a cell. Rapidly growing cancer cells rely on specific chaperones, and some chaperones play key roles in [[chemotherapy]] resistance. Inhibitions to these specific chaperones are seen as potential modes of action for efficient chemotherapy drugs or for reducing the spread of cancer.<ref name="10.1016/j.biopha.2011.04.025"/> Using Folding@home and working closely with the Center for Protein Folding Machinery, the Pande lab hopes to find a drug which inhibits those chaperones involved in cancerous cells.<ref name="typepad: nanomedicine ce"/> Researchers are also using Folding@home to study other molecules related to cancer, such as the enzyme [[Src kinase]] and certain forms of the [[Engrailed (gene)|engrailed]] [[homeodomain]]<U+2014>a large protein which may be involved in many diseases, including cancer.<ref name="typepad: protomol b4"/><ref name="description: 180"/> In 2011, Folding@home began simulations of the dynamics of the small [[Trefoil knot fold|knottin]] protein EETI, which can identify [[carcinoma]]s in [[medical imaging|imaging scan]]s by binding to [[cell surface receptor|surface receptor]]s of cancer cells.<ref name="forum: 7600 in beta"/><ref name="description: 7600"/>

[[Interleukin 2]] (IL-2) is a protein that helps [[T cell]]s of the [[immune system]] attack pathogens and tumors. Unfortunately, its use as a cancer treatment is restricted due to serious side effects such as [[pulmonary edema]]. IL-2 binds to these pulmonary cells differently than it does to T cells, so IL-2 research involves understanding the differences between these binding mechanisms. In 2012, Folding@home assisted with the discovery of a form of IL-2 which is three hundred times more effective in its immune system role but carries fewer side effects. In experiments, this altered form significantly outperformed natural IL-2 in impeding tumor growth. [[Pharmaceutical companies]] have expressed interest in the mutant molecule, and the [[National Institutes of Health]] are testing it against a large variety of tumor models in the hopes of accelerating its development as a therapeutic.<ref name="scientists boost IL-2 potency"/><ref name="10.1038/nature10975"/>

=== Osteogenesis imperfecta ===
[[Osteogenesis imperfecta]], known as brittle bone disease, is an incurable genetic bone disorder which can be lethal. Those with the disease are unable to make functional connective bone tissue. This is most commonly due to a mutation in [[Type-I collagen]],<ref name="10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16051-0"/> which fulfills a variety of structural roles and is the most abundant protein in [[mammal]]s.<ref name="978-0-387-73905-2"/> The mutation causes a deformation in [[Collagen helix|collagen's triple helix structure]], which if not naturally destroyed, leads to abnormal and weakened bone tissue.<ref name="10.1016/j.bpj.2009.04.059"/> In 2005, Folding@home tested a new [[quantum mechanical]] technique that improved upon previous simulations methods, and which may be useful for future computational studies of collagen.<ref name="10.1002/jcc.20301"/> Although researchers have used Folding@home to study collagen folding and misfolding, the interest stands as a pilot project compared to Alzheimer's and Huntington's research.<ref name="diseases FAQ"/>

=== Viruses ===
Folding@home is assisting in research towards preventing certain [[virus]]es such as [[influenza]] and [[HIV]] from recognizing and entering [[biological cells]].<ref name="diseases FAQ"/> In 2011 Folding@home began simulations of the dynamics of the enzyme [[RNase H]], a key component of HIV, in the hopes of designing drugs to deactivate it.<ref name="forum: 10125"/> Folding@home has also been used to study [[membrane fusion]], an essential event for [[viral entry|viral infection]] and a wide range of biological functions. This fusion involves [[conformational change]]s of viral fusion proteins and [[protein docking]],<ref name="978-0-340-66316-5"/> but the exact molecular mechanisms behind fusion remain largely unknown.<ref name="10.1039/c0cs00115e"/> Fusion events may comprise of over a half million atoms interacting for hundreds of microseconds. This complexity limits typical computer simulations to about ten thousand atoms over tens of nanoseconds: a difference of several orders of magnitude.<ref name="10.1038/cr.2010.57"/> The development of models to predict the mechanisms of membrane fusion will assist in the scientific understanding of how to target the process with antiviral drugs.<ref name="Peter Kasson"/> In 2006 scientists applied Markov state models and the Folding@home network to discover two pathways for fusion and gain other mechanistic insights.<ref name="10.1038/cr.2010.57"/>

Following detailed simulations from Folding@home of small cells known as [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]], in 2007 the Pande lab introduced a new computational technique for measuring the [[topology]] of its structural changes during fusion.<ref name="10.1093/bioinformatics/btm250"/> In 2009, researchers used Folding@home to study mutations of [[Hemagglutinin (influenza)|influenza hemagglutinin]], a protein that attaches a virus to its [[Host (biology)|host]] cell and assists with viral entry. Mutations to hemagglutinin affect [[binding affinity|how well the protein binds]] to a host's [[cell surface receptor]] molecules, which determines how [[infectivity|infective]] the virus strain is to the host organism.  Knowledge of the effects of hemagglutinin mutations assists in the development of [[antiviral drug]]s.<ref name="10.1021/ja904557w"/><ref name="19209725, 2811693"/> As of 2012, Folding@home continues to simulate the folding and interactions of hemagglutinin, complementing experimental studies at the [[University of Virginia]].<ref name="diseases FAQ"/><ref name="typepad: kasson update"/>

=== Drug design ===
[[Drug]]s function by [[ligand binding|binding]] to [[binding site|specific locations]] on target molecules and causing a certain desired change, such as disabling the target or causing a [[conformational change]]. Ideally, a drug should act very specifically and bind only to its target without interfering with other biological functions. However, it is difficult to precisely determine where and [[binding affinity|how tightly]] two molecules will bind. Due to limitations in computational power, current ''[[in silico]]'' approaches usually have to trade speed for [[accuracy]]; e.g. use rapid [[protein docking]] methods instead of computationally expensive [[free energy calculation]]s. Folding@home's computational performance allows researchers to use both techniques, and evaluate their efficiency and reliability.<ref name="Press FAQ"/><ref name="typepad: drug design methods"/><ref name="10.1063/1.2221680"/> Computer-assisted drug design has the potential to expedite and lower the costs of drug discovery.<ref name="10.1093/bib/bbp023"/> In 2010, Folding@home used MSMs and free energy calculations to predict the native state of the [[villin]] protein to within 1.8 [[angstrom|<U+00C5>]] RMSD ([[root mean square deviation]]) from the [[crystalline structure]] experimentally determined through [[X-ray crystallography]]. This accuracy has implications to future [[protein structure prediction]] approaches, including for [[intrinsically unstructured proteins]].<ref name="10.1038/cr.2010.57"/> Scientists have used Folding@home to research [[drug resistance]] by studying [[vancomycin]], an [[drug of last resort|antibiotic of "last resort"]], and [[beta-lactamase]], a protein that can break down antibiotics like [[penicillin]].<ref name="description: 10721"/><ref name="typepad: drug targets"/>

Chemical activity occurs along a protein's [[active site]]. Traditional drug design approaches involve tightly binding to this site and blocking its activity, under the assumption that the target protein exists in a single rigid structure. However, this approach only works for approximately 15% of all proteins. Proteins contain [[allosteric site]]s which, when bound to by small molecules, can alter a protein's conformation and ultimately affect the protein's activity. These sites are attractive drug targets, but locating them is very [[computationally expensive]]. In 2012, Folding@home and MSMs were used to identify allosteric site in three medically relevant proteins: beta-lactamase, [[interleukin-2]], and [[RNase H]].<ref name="typepad: drug targets"/><ref name="10.1073/pnas.1209309109"/>

Approximately half of all known [[antibiotic]]s interfere with the workings of a bacteria's [[ribosome]], a large and complex biochemical machine that performs [[protein biosynthesis]] by [[translation (biology)|translating]] [[messenger RNA]] into proteins. [[Macrolide antibiotics]] clog the ribosome's exit tunnel, preventing synthesis of essential bacterial proteins. In 2007 the Pande lab received a [[grant (money)|grant]] to study and design new antibiotics.<ref name="diseases FAQ"/> In 2008 they used Folding@home to study the interior of this tunnel and how specific molecules may affect it.<ref name="10.1073/pnas.0801795105"/> The full structure of the ribosome has only been recently determined, and Folding@home has also simulated [[ribosomal protein]]s, as many of their functions remain largely unknown.<ref name="description: 5765"/>

In addition to reporting active processors, Folding@home determines its computing performance as measured in floating point operations per second ([[FLOPS]]) based on the actual execution time of its calculations. Originally this was reported as native FLOPS: the raw performance from each given type of processing hardware.<ref name="FLOPS FAQ"/> In March 2009 Folding@home began reporting the performance in native and x86 FLOPS,<ref name="typepad: FLOPS"/> the latter being an estimation of how many FLOPS the calculation would take on a standard [[x86]] CPU architecture, which is commonly used as a performance reference. Specialized hardware such as GPUs can efficiently perform certain complex functions in a single floating point operation which would otherwise require multiple operations on the x86 architecture. The x86 measurement attempts to even out these hardware differences.<ref name="FLOPS FAQ"/> Despite conservative conversions, the GPU and PS3 clients' x86 FLOPS are consistently greater than their native FLOPS and comprise a large majority of Folding@home's measured computing performance.<ref name="FAH osstats"/><ref name="PS3 FAQ"/>

In 2007 [[Guinness World Records|Guinness]] recognized Folding@home as the most powerful distributed computing network.<ref name="guinness most powerful DC"/> As of October&nbsp;20, 2012, the project has 215,312&nbsp;active CPUs, 20,530&nbsp;active GPUs, and 17,257&nbsp;active PS3s, for a total of 3.821&nbsp;native petaFLOPs (5.586&nbsp;x86 petaFLOPS).<ref name="FAH osstats"/> At the same time, the combined efforts of all distributed computing projects under BOINC totals 6.961&nbsp;petaFLOPS.<ref name="BOINC credit overview"/> Using the Markov state model approach, Folding@home achieves [[strong scaling]] across its user base and gains a linear [[speedup]] for every additional processor.<ref name="10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002"/><ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006"/> This network allows Folding@home to do work that was previously computationally impractical.<ref name="10.1038/sj.embor.7400108"/>

In March 2002 [[Google]] co-founder [[Sergey Brin]] launched [[Google Compute]] as an add-on for the [[Google Toolbar]].<ref name="news: Google supercomputing"/> Although limited in functionality and scope, it increased participation in Folding@home from 10,000&nbsp;up to about 30,000&nbsp;active CPUs.<ref name="Biotech 27"/> The program ended in October 2005 in favor of the official Folding@home clients, and is no longer available for the Toolbar.<ref name="idle time precious"/> Folding@home also gained participants from [[Genome@home]], another distributed computing project from the Pande lab and a sister project to Folding@home. The goal of Genome@home was [[protein design]] and associated applications. Following its official conclusion in March 2004, users were asked to donate computing power to Folding@home instead.<ref name="G@h updates"/>

=== Performance ===
[[File:Folding@home and Supercomputer Computational Powers.png|thumb|right|400px|Computational power of Folding@home and the fastest supercomputer from April 2004 to October 2012. Between June 2007 and June 2011, Folding@home (blue and red) exceeded the performance of [[Top500]]'s fastest supercomputer (green). However it was eclipsed by [[K computer]] in November 2011 and [[Blue Gene/Q]] in June 2012.<sup id="Note 1 back">[[#Note 1|Note 1]]</sup>]]

On September&nbsp;16, 2007, due in large part to the participation of PS3s, the Folding@home project officially attained a sustained performance level higher than one native petaFLOP, becoming the first computing system of any kind to do so.<ref name="typepad: crossing 1 PF"/><ref name="10.1016/j.cub.2012.01.008"/> [[Top500]]'s fastest supercomputer at the time was [[BlueGene/L]], at 0.280 petaFLOPS.<ref name="Top500 June 2007"/> The following year, on May&nbsp;7, 2008, the project attained a sustained performance level higher than two native petaFLOPS,<ref name="FAH reaches 2 PF"/> followed by the three and four native petaFLOPS milestones on August&nbsp;20<ref name="Nvidia-FAH milestone"/><ref name="3 PF barrier"/> and September&nbsp;28, 2008 respectively.<ref name="past 4 petaFLOPS"/> On February&nbsp;18, 2009, Folding@home achieved five native petaFLOPS,<ref name="typepad: FAH passes 5 PF"/><ref name="crossing 5 PF barrier"/> and was the first computing project to meet these five levels.<ref name="Community Grid Computing"/><ref name="review of FAH"/> In comparison, November 2008's fastest supercomputer was [[IBM]]'s [[IBM Roadrunner|Roadrunner]] at 1.105 petaFLOPS.<ref name="Top500 November 2008"/> On November&nbsp;10, 2011, Folding@home's performance exceeded six native petaFLOPS with the equivalent of nearly eight x86 petaFLOPS.<ref name="10.1016/j.cub.2012.01.008"/><ref name="6 petaFLOPS"/>

== Points ==
Similarly to other distributed computing projects, Folding@home quantitatively assesses user computing contributions to the project through a credit system.<ref name="Points FAQ"/> All units from a given protein project have uniform base credit, which is determined by benchmarking one or more work units from that project on an official reference machine before the project is released.<ref name="PointsNew FAQ"/> Each user receives these base points for completing every work unit, though through the use of a passkey they can receive additional bonus points for reliably and rapidly completing units which are more computationally demanding or have a greater scientific priority.<ref name="Passkey FAQ"/><ref name="SMP2 release"/> Users may also receive credit for their work by clients on multiple machines.<ref name="Main FAQ"/> This point system attempts to align awarded credit with the value of the scientific results.<ref name="Points FAQ"/><ref name="PointsNew FAQ"/>

Users can register their contributions under a team, which combine the points of all their members. A user can start their own team, or they can join an existing team.<ref name="FAH homepage"/> In some cases, a team may have their own community-driven sources of help or recruitment such as an [[Internet forum]].<ref name="Extreme overclocking forum"/> The points can foster friendly competition between individuals and teams to compute the most for the project, which can benefit the folding community and accelerate scientific research.<ref name="Points FAQ"/><ref name="10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922"/><ref name="MaximumPC Chimp Challenge"/> Individual and team statistics are posted on the Folding@home website.<ref name="Points FAQ"/>

== Software ==
Folding@home software at the user's end involves three primary components: work units, cores, and a client.

=== Work units ===
A work unit is the protein data that the client is asked to process. Work units are a fraction of the simulation between the states in a Markov state model. After the work unit has been downloaded and completely processed by a volunteer's computer, it is returned to Folding@home servers, which then award the volunteer the credit points.  This cycle repeats automatically.<ref name="10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922"/> All work units have associated deadlines, and if this deadline is exceeded, the user may not get credit and the unit will be automatically reissued to another participant. As protein folding is serial in nature and many work units are generated from their predecessors, this allows the overall simulation process to proceed normally if a work unit is not returned after a reasonable period of time. Due to these deadlines, the minimum system requirement for Folding@home is a Pentium&nbsp;3 450&nbsp;MHz CPU with [[Streaming SIMD Extensions]] (SSE).<ref name="Main FAQ"/> However, work units for high-performance clients have a much shorter deadline than those for the uniprocessor client, as a major part of the scientific benefit is dependent on rapidly completing simulations.<ref name="SMP FAQ"/>

Before public release, work units go through several [[quality assurance]] steps to keep problematic ones from becoming fully available. These stages include internal testing, closed beta testing, and open beta testing, before a final full release across Folding@home.<ref name="typepad: more transparency"/> Folding@home's work units are normally processed only once, except in the rare event that errors occur during processing. If this occurs for three different users, the unit is automatically pulled from distribution.<ref name="forum: Gromacs cannot continue"/><ref name="forum: 6803(4,66,255)"/> The Folding@home support forum can be used to differentiate between issues arising from problematic hardware and bad work units.<ref name="forum: troubleshooting bad WUs"/>

=== Cores ===
{{main|Folding@home cores}}
Specialized molecular dynamics programs, referred to as "FahCores" and often abbreviated "cores", perform the calculations on the work unit as a [[background process]]. A large majority of Folding@home's cores are based on [[GROMACS]],<ref name="10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922"/> one of the fastest and most popular molecular dynamics software packages, which largely consists of manually optimized [[assembly code]] and hardware optimizations.<ref name="10.1002/jcc.20703"/><ref name="10.1021/ct700301q"/> Although GROMACS is [[open-source software]] and there is a cooperative effort between the Pande lab and GROMACS developers, Folding@home uses a [[closed-source]] license for data validity reasons.<ref name="Gromacs FAQ"/> Less active cores include ProtoMol and SHARPEN. Folding@home has used [[AMBER]], [[CPMD]], [[Desmond (software)|Desmond]], and [[TINKER]], but these have since been retired and are no longer in active service.<ref name="Open Source FAQ"/><ref name="FAQ index"/><ref name="typepad: update on new FahCores"/> Some of these cores perform [[explicit water model|explicit solvation]] calculations in which the surrounding [[solvent]] (usually water) is modeled atom-by-atom; while others perform [[implicit solvation]] methods, where the solvent is treated as a mathematical continuum.<ref name="10.1002/jcc.21209"/><ref name="Petaflop FAQ"/> The core is separate from the client to enable the scientific methods to be updated automatically without requiring a client update. The cores periodically create calculation [[application checkpointing|checkpoints]] so that if they are interrupted they can resume work from that point upon startup.<ref name="10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922"/>

=== Client ===
Folding@home participants install a [[client (computing)|client]] [[computer program|program]] on their [[personal computer]] or on the [[PS3]] gaming console. The user interacts with the client, which manages the other software components in the background. Through the client, the user may pause the folding process, open an event log, check the work progress, or view personal statistics.<ref name="Uni Guide"/> The computer clients run continuously in the [[background (computer software)|background]] at an extremely low priority, using idle processing power so that normal computer usage is unaffected.<ref name="FAH homepage"/><ref name="Main FAQ"/> The maximum CPU usage can be adjusted through client settings.<ref name="Uni Guide"/><ref name="forum: can FAH damage PC?"/> The client connects to a Folding@home [[server (computing)|server]] and retrieves a work unit and may also download the appropriate core for the client's settings, operating system, and the underlying hardware architecture. After processing, the work unit is returned to the Folding@home servers. Computer clients are tailored to [[uniprocessor]] and [[multi-core processor]]s systems, as well as [[graphics processing unit]]s. While these latter clients use significantly more resources, the diversity and power of each [[hardware architecture]] provides Folding@home with the ability to efficiently complete many types of simulations in a timely manner (in a few weeks or months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value. Together, these clients allow researchers to study biomedical questions previously considered impractical to tackle computationally.<ref name="Press FAQ"/><ref name="10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922"/><ref name="SMP FAQ"/>

Professional software developers are responsible for most of Folding@home's code, both for the client and server-side. The development team includes programmers from Nvidia, ATI, Sony, and Cauldron Development.<ref name="typepad: how does dev get done"/> Clients can be downloaded only from the official Folding@home website or its commercial partners, and will only interact with Folding@home computer files. They will upload and download data with Stanford's Folding@home data servers (over [[Computer port (software)|port]]&nbsp;8080, with 80&nbsp;as an alternative), and the communication is verified using 2048-bit [[digital signatures]].<ref name="Main FAQ"/><ref name="Uninstall"/> While the client's [[GUI]] is open-source,<ref name="FAHControl source code"/> the client itself is [[proprietary software|proprietary]] for security and scientific integrity reasons.<ref name="FAH license"/><ref name="forum: FAH EULA"/><ref name="help ubuntu"/>

Folding@home uses the [[Cosm (distributed computing)|Cosm]] software libraries for networking.<ref name="10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922"/><ref name="typepad: how does dev get done"/> When Folding@home was launched on October&nbsp;1, 2000, its first client was a [[screensaver]], which would run while the computer was not otherwise in use.<ref name="10.1126/science.290.5498.1903"/><ref name="Executive summary"/> In 2004 the Pande lab collaborated with [[David P. Anderson|David Anderson]] to test a supplemental client on the open-source BOINC framework. This client was released to closed beta in April 2005;<ref name="FAH for BOINC soon"/> however, the approach became unworkable and was shelved in June 2006.<ref name="High-Per FAQ"/>

==== Graphics processing units ====
The specialized hardware of [[GPU]]s is designed to accelerate rendering of 3D&nbsp;graphics applications such as video games and can significantly outperform CPUs for certain types of calculations. GPUs are one of the most powerful and rapidly growing computational platforms and many scientists and researchers are pursuing [[GPGPU|general purpose GPU]] (GPGPU) computing. However, GPU hardware is difficult to use for non-graphics tasks and usually requires significant algorithm restructuring and an advanced understanding of the underlying architecture.<ref name="10.1111/j.1467-8659.2007.01012.x"/> Such customization is challenging, especially to researchers with limited software development resources. Folding@home uses the [[open source]] [[OpenMM]] [[library (computing)|library]], which uses a [[bridge pattern|bridge design pattern]] with two [[Application programming interface]] (API) levels to interface molecular simulation software to an underlying hardware architecture. With the addition of hardware optimizations, OpenMM-based GPU simulations do not require significant modification but achieve performance nearly equal to hand-tuned GPU code, and greatly outperform CPU implementations.<ref name="10.1002/jcc.21209"/><ref name="10.1109/MCSE.2010.27"/>

Before 2010 the computational reliability of GPGPU consumer-grade hardware was largely unknown, and circumstantial evidence related to the lack of built-in [[error detection and correction]] in GPU memory raised reliability concerns. In the first large-scale test of GPU scientific accuracy, a 2010 study of over 20,000&nbsp;hosts on the Folding@home network detected [[soft error]]s in the memory subsystems of two-thirds of the tested GPUs. These errors strongly correlated to board architecture, though the study concluded that reliable GPU computing was very feasible as long as attention is paid to the hardware characteristics, such as software-side error detection.<ref name="10.1109/CCGRID.2010.84"/>

The first generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU1) was released to the public on October&nbsp;2, 2006,<ref name="High-Per FAQ"/> delivering a 20-30X speedup for certain calculations over its CPU-based [[GROMACS]] counterparts.<ref name="ATI FAQ"/> It was the first time GPUs had been used for either distributed computing or major molecular dynamics calculations.<ref name="typepad: GPU news"/><ref name="978-3-642-14389-2"/> GPU1 gave researchers significant knowledge and experience with the development of [[GPGPU]] software, but in response to scientific inaccuracies with [[DirectX]], on April&nbsp;10, 2008 it was succeeded by GPU2, the second generation of the client.<ref name="ATI FAQ"/><ref name="typepad: GPU2 open beta"/> Following the introduction of GPU2, GPU1 was officially retired on June&nbsp;6.<ref name="ATI FAQ"/> Compared to GPU1, GPU2 was more scientifically reliable and productive, ran on [[ATI (brand)|ATI]] and [[CUDA]]-enabled [[Nvidia]] GPUs, and supported more advanced algorithms, larger proteins, and real-time visualization of the protein simulation.<ref name="typepad: GPU2 goes live"/><ref name="typepad: GPU2 going well"/> Following this, the third generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU3) was released on May&nbsp;25, 2010. While [[backwards compatible]] with GPU2, GPU3 was stabler and more efficient, had greater flexibility in its scientific capabilities,<ref name="typepad: GPU3 prep"/> and used OpenMM on top of an [[OpenCL]] framework.<ref name="typepad: GPU3 prep"/><ref name="typepad: GPU3 open beta"/> Although the GPU clients do not natively support the Linux operating system, users with Nvidia graphics cards can run them on the [[Wine (software)|Wine]] software application.<ref name="forum: 7.1.38 released"/><ref name="forum: GPU3 headless guide"/> GPUs remain Folding@home's most powerful platform in terms of [[FLOPS]]; as of September 2012 GPU clients account for 76% of the entire project's x86 FLOPS throughput.<ref name="FAH osstats"/>

==== PlayStation 3 ====
{{further2 | [[Life with PlayStation]]}}
[[File:LifeWithPlayStation Folding.jpg|thumb|280px|The PlayStation 3's ''Life With PlayStation'' client displays a 3D animation of the protein being folded]]

Folding@home can take advantage of the computing power of [[PlayStation 3]]s. At the time of its inception, its main [[stream processing|streaming]] [[Cell processor]] delivered a 20x speed increase over PCs for certain calculations, processing power which could not be found on other systems such as the [[Xbox 360]].<ref name="Press FAQ"/><ref name="Biotech 27"/> The PS3's high speed and efficiency introduced other opportunities for worthwhile optimizations according to [[Amdahl's law]], and significantly changed the tradeoff between computational efficiency and overall accuracy, allowing for the use of more complex molecular models at little additional computational cost.<ref name="10.1002/jcc.21054"/> This allowed Folding@home to run biomedical calculations that would otherwise be computationally infeasible.<ref name="cnn ps3"/>

The PS3 client was developed in a collaborative effort between [[Sony]] and the Pande lab and was first released as a standalone client on March&nbsp;23, 2007.<ref name="Press FAQ"/><ref name="PS3 to study cancer"/> Its release made Folding@home the first distributed computing project to use PS3s.<ref name="PS3 research project"/> On September&nbsp;18 of the following year, the PS3 client became a channel of [[Life with PlayStation]] on its launch.<ref name="Life With PS3 live"/><ref name="typepad: life with PS"/> In terms of the types of calculations it can perform, at the time of its introduction the client took the middle ground between a CPU's flexibility and a GPU's speed.<ref name="10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922"/> However, unlike CPUs and GPUs, users cannot perform other activities on their PS3 while running Folding@home.<ref name="cnn ps3"/> The PS3's uniform console environment makes [[technical support|support]] easier and makes Folding@home more [[user friendly]].<ref name="Press FAQ"/> The PS3 also has the ability to stream data quickly to its GPU, and is capable of real-time atomic-level visualizations of the current protein dynamics.<ref name="10.1002/jcc.21054"/>

Following the 4.30 PlayStation 3 update, in early November 2012 Sony and the Pande lab will be concluding support for the Folding@home PS3 client and other services available under ''Life with PlayStation''. Since its introduction, more than 15 million users have contributed over 100 million hours of computation to Folding@home. These contributions have greatly assisted the project with disease research. Pande considers the PlayStation 3 client a "game changer" for the project.<ref name="PS3 4.30 update, drop F@h"/>

==== Multi-core processing client ====
Folding@home can use the [[parallel processing]] capabilities of modern multi-core processors. The ability to use several CPU cores simultaneously allows completion of the overall folding simulation much faster. Working together, these CPU cores complete single work units proportionately faster than the standard uniprocessor client. This approach is scientifically valuable because it enables much longer simulation trajectories to be performed in the same amount of time, and reduces the traditional difficulties of scaling a large simulation to many separate processors.<ref name="typepad: what does SMP do"/> A 2007 publication in the ''[[Journal of Molecular Biology]]'' relied on multi-core processing to simulate the folding of part of the [[villin]] protein approximately 10 times longer than was possible with a single-processor client, in agreement with experimental folding rates.<ref name="10.1016/j.jmb.2007.09.069"/>

In November 2006, first-generation [[symmetric multiprocessing]] (SMP) clients were publicly released for open beta testing, referred to as SMP1.<ref name="High-Per FAQ"/> These clients used [[Message Passing Interface]] (MPI) communication protocols for parallel processing, as at that time the GROMACS cores were [[Thread-safe|not designed]] to be used with multiple threads.<ref name="SMP FAQ"/> This was the first time a distributed computing project had used MPI.<ref name="typepad: new client dev"/> Although the clients performed well in [[Unix]]-based operating systems such as Linux and Mac OS X, they were troublesome under [[Windows]].<ref name="typepad: what does SMP do"/><ref name="typepad: new client dev"/> On January&nbsp;24, 2010, SMP2, the second generation of the SMP clients and the successor to SMP1, was released as an open beta and replaced the complex MPI with a more reliable [[Thread (computer science)|thread]]-based implementation.<ref name="SMP2 release"/><ref name="typepad: how does dev get done"/>

SMP2 supports a trial of a special category of "bigadv" work units, designed for simulating proteins that are unusually large and computationally intensive and have a great scientific priority. These units originally required a minimum of eight CPU cores,<ref name="bigadv"/> which was later increased on February&nbsp;7, 2012 to sixteen CPU cores.<ref name="typepad: update on bigadv-16"/> In addition to these additional hardware requirements over standard SMP2 work units, they require more system resources such as [[RAM]] and [[Internet bandwidth]]. In return, users who run these are rewarded with a 20% increase over SMP2's bonus point system.<ref name="typepad: bigadv points change"/> The bigadv category allows Folding@home to run particularly demanding simulations on long timescales that had previously required the use of supercomputing [[Computer cluster#Compute clusters|clusters]] and could not be performed anywhere else on Folding@home.<ref name="bigadv"/>

==== V7 ====
[[File:F@h v7 novice shot.png|thumb|400px|A sample image of the V7 client in Novice mode running under [[Windows&nbsp;7]]. In addition to a variety of controls and user details, V7 presents work unit information, such as its state, calculation progress, ETA, credit points, identification numbers, and description.]]

The V7 client is the seventh and latest generation of the Folding@home client software, and is a complete rewrite and unification of the previous clients for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Linux]] operating systems.<ref name="V7 install guide"/><ref name="typepad: V7 in open beta"/> Like its predecessors, V7 can run Folding@home in the background at a very low priority, allowing other applications to use CPU resources as they need. It is designed to make the installation, start-up, and operation more user-friendly for novices, as well as offer greater scientific flexibility to researchers than previous clients.<ref name="typepad: ATI core 16 released"/> V7 uses [[Trac]] for [[Bug tracking system|managing its bug tickets]] so that users can see its development process and provide feedback.<ref name="typepad: V7 in open beta"/> It was officially released on March&nbsp;22, 2012.<ref name="typepad: v7 rollout"/>

V7 consists of four integrated elements. The user typically interacts with V7's open-source [[GUI]], known as FAHControl.<ref name="FAHControl source code"/><ref name="Ticket #736"/> This has Novice, Advanced, and Expert user interface modes, and has the ability to monitor, configure, and control many remote folding clients from a single computer. FAHControl directs FAHClient<U+2014>a [[back-end]] application that in turn manages each FAHSlot (or "slot"). Each slot acts as replacement for the previously distinct Folding@home v6 uniprocessor, SMP, or GPU computer clients, as it can download, process, and upload work units independently. The FAHViewer function, modeled after the PS3's viewer, displays a real-time 3D rendering, if available, of the protein currently being processed.<ref name="V7 install guide"/><ref name="typepad: V7 in open beta"/>

== Comparison to other molecular simulators ==
[[Rosetta@home]] is a distributed computing project aimed at protein structure prediction and is one of the most accurate [[tertiary structure]] predictors.<ref name="10.1002/prot.21804"/><ref name="10.1002/prot.22210"/> The conformational states from Rosetta's software can be used to initialize a Markov state model as starting points for Folding@home simulations.<ref name="Simulation FAQ"/> Conversely, structure prediction algorithms can be improved from thermodynamic and kinetic models and the sampling aspects of protein folding simulations.<ref name="10.1371/journal.pone.0005840"/> As Rosetta only tries to predict the final folded state, and not how proteins fold, Rosetta@home and Folding@home are complementary and address very different molecular questions.<ref name="Simulation FAQ"/><ref name="F@H vs R@h"/>

[[Anton (computer)|Anton]] is a special-purpose supercomputer constructed for molecular dynamics simulations. As of October 2011 Anton and Folding@home are the two most powerful molecular dynamics systems.<ref name="typepad: comparison with Anton"/> Anton is unique in its ability to produce single ultra-long computationally expensive molecular trajectories,<ref name="10.1021/ja207470h"/> such as one in 2010 which reached the millisecond range.<ref name="10.1145/1654059.1654099"/><ref name="10.1126/science.1187409"/> These long trajectories may be particular helpful towards certain types of biochemical problems.<ref name="10.1145/1364782.1364802"/><ref name="10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155245"/> However, Anton does not use Markov state models for analysis. In 2011 the Pande lab constructed a MSM from two 100-[[microsecond|<U+00B5>s]] Anton simulations and found alternative folding pathways that were not visible through Anton's traditional analysis. They concluded that there was little difference between MSMs constructed from a limited number of long trajectories or one assembled from many shorter trajectories.<ref name="10.1021/ja207470h"/> In June 2011 Folding@home began additional sampling of an Anton simulation in an effort to better determine how its techniques compare to Anton's methods.<ref name="forum: 7610/7611 in beta"/><ref name="description: 7610"/> However, unlike Folding@home's shorter trajectories, which are more amendable to distributed computing and other parallelization techniques, longer trajectories do not require adaptive sampling to sufficiently sample the protein's [[phase space]]. Due to this, it is possible that a combination of Anton's and Folding@home's simulation methods would provide a more thorough sampling of this space.<ref name="10.1021/ja207470h"/>

<cite id="Note 1">[[#Note 1 back|Note 1:]]</cite> Supercomputer FLOPS performance is assessed by running the legacy [[LINPACK]] benchmark. This short-term testing has difficulty in accurately reflecting sustained performance on real-world tasks because LINPACK more efficiently maps to supercomputer hardware.

Despite this, FLOPS remain the primary speed metric used in supercomputing.<ref name="forum: GPU flop conversion 2"/><ref name="supercomputer only technically the fastest"/> In contrast, Folding@home determines its FLOPS using [[wall clock time]] by measuring how much time its work units take to complete.<ref name="forum: vs PPD numbers"/><ref name="forum: vs PPD numbers 2"/><ref name="forum: GPU flops conversion"/>
