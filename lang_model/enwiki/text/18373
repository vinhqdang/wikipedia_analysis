'''Scott David Zolak''' (born December 13, 1967 in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]) is a former [[American football]] [[quarterback]] who played in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for nine seasons. Over the course of his career, he played in 55 games for the [[New England Patriots]] and [[Miami Dolphins]], completed 124 of 248 passes for 1,314&nbsp;yards, threw eight touchdowns and seven interceptions, and finished his career with a passer rating of 64.8.

A graduate of [[Ringgold High School (Pennsylvania)|Ringgold High School]] and the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], Zolak was selected 84th in the [[1991 NFL Draft|1991]] [[NFL Draft]] by the New England Patriots. He did not play in 1991, but started a few games in 1992 and had his most productive season statistically. When [[Drew Bledsoe]] was drafted in 1993, Zolak became his backup for the next six seasons. He appeared as a replacement for Bledsoe when he was hurt, but only started three games during this time. He was released at the end of the 1998 season, and signed with the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins in 1999, playing in one game for Miami before retiring. After his retirement, he became a sportscaster and football analyst in the New England area.

==Early life==
===High school===
Zolak was born on December 13, 1967 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As a child, he acted as the [[waterboy]] for the football team at [[Ringgold High School (Pennsylvania)|Ringgold High School]] in [[Monongahela, Pennsylvania]], where his father, Paul, worked as head coach and [[athletic director]].<ref name=montana/><ref name=patriots>{{cite web|url=http://archive.patriots.com/alumni/index.cfm?ac=alumnibiosdetail&bio=857|title=Scott Zolak - Official New England Patriots Biography|publisher=Patriots.com|accessdate=2009-05-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Gerald|last=Eskenazi|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/21/sports/football-zolak-the-unfathomable-to-lead-pats-against-jets.html|title=Football; Zolak the Unfathomable To Lead Pats Against Jets|date=November 21, 1992|accessdate=2009-05-24|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>  Future NFL quarterback [[Joe Montana]] played for Ringgold during this time and gave Zolak a football, which he later rubbed for good luck before every game.<ref name=montana>{{cite news|title=Chalk Talk|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|page=6D|date=November 15, 1992}}</ref> When Zolak attended Ringgold High School himself, he was the team's [[starting lineup|starting]] quarterback and [[punter (American football)|punter]], and [[Letterman (sports)|lettered]] four times.<ref name=patriots/> Zolak also played on the Ringgold basketball team as a [[forward (basketball)|forward]], and was a four-time letterman in that sport as well.<ref name=patriots/> As a result of his football performance, he was invited to participate in the [[Big 33 Football Classic]], which featured the top high school football players in Pennsylvania.<ref>{{cite news|title=Harris, Owens: Big 33's potent pair|first=Mike|last=White|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=August 4, 1986|page=14}}</ref>

===College===
After graduating from high school, Zolak played [[college football]] at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]. He sat out his freshmen year, and became the third-string quarterback behind Dan Henning and [[Neil O'Donnell]] after two quarterbacks transferred.<ref>{{cite news|first=Sally|last=Jenkins|title=Maryland's Komlo to Transfer; Backup Quarterback Wants More Playing Time|work=[[The Washington Post]]|page=e1|date=February 10, 1987}}</ref> By the end of his sophomore season, Zolak was challenging O'Donnell for the starting job after Henning graduated.<ref>{{cite news|first=Dave|last=Sell|title=Maryland Starts Practicing|work=The Washington Post|page=f9|date=March 23, 1988}}</ref> As his junior year began, in the summer of 1988, offensive coordinator [[Bob Valesente]] said that Zolak was making tremendous strides as a quarterback, but O'Donnell was the starting quarterback that year.<ref>{{cite news|first=Dave|last=Sell|title=O'Donnell Wants Fun From Start; He and Terrapins Seek Early Success|work=The Washington Post|date=August 12, 1988|page=f3}}</ref> Zolak's first collegiate appearance came against [[1988 West Virginia Mountaineers football team|West Virginia]]. He [[completion (American football)|completed]] four of six [[forward pass|passes]] for 28&nbsp;yards, but had an [[interception (American football)|interception]] returned for a [[touchdown]] by [[Bo Orlando]] in a 55&ndash;24 loss.<ref>{{cite news|first=Dave|last=Sell|title=Miami Rallies, 31-30; Terrapins Routed; Mountaineers Pull Away in 2nd Half, 55-24|work=The Washington Post|date=September 18, 1988|page=d1}}</ref> He appeared in four games for Maryland that season.<ref name=patriots/>

Zolak was again the backup behind O'Donnell in 1989. He played in eight games, completing 33 of 69 passes for 407&nbsp;yards and two touchdowns.<ref name=patriots/> In 1990, after O'Donnell graduated and began his NFL career, Zolak became the [[List of Maryland Terrapins quarterbacks|starter for Maryland]], and head coach [[Joe Krivak]] had high hopes for him heading into the season.<ref>{{cite news|first=Anthony|last=Cotton|title=Terrapins Have Two Players Fail to Make Grade; Offensive Starter Falls Just Short|work=The Washington Post|date=August 29, 1990|page=c2}}</ref> In his first start as a senior, Zolak completed a school record 28 passes in 46 attempts for 303&nbsp;yards and two touchdowns, including a 51-yard pass to Gene Thomas with 61 seconds left that gave Maryland the win against {{cfb link|year=1990|team=Virginia Tech Hokies|title=Virginia Tech}}, 20&ndash;13.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tech Victory Just Out Of Reach Terps Win Opener 20-13 On Late TD|work=[[The Roanoke Times]]|page=C1|date=September 2, 1990}}</ref> The following week, he once more featured in a dramatic conclusion, throwing a 59-yard touchdown pass to Gene Thomas with 2:27 left to beat 25th ranked {{cfb link|year=1990|team=West Virginia Mountaineers|title=West Virginia}}, 14&ndash;10.<ref>{{cite news|title=Maryland Rallies, Stuns West Virginia|work=[[The Charlotte Observer]]|page=10D|date=September 9, 1990}}</ref> However, he was struggling in other aspects of his game. In an October game against [[1990 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|Georgia Tech]], Zolak was [[quarterback sack|sacked]] 10 times. In four games, he had been sacked 23 times and had a pass intercepted 12 times.<ref>{{cite news|title=Georgia Tech Has 11 Sacks, Bags Maryland, 31-3|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=10|date=October 7, 1990}}</ref> By the end of the season, as Maryland was preparing to face {{cfb link|year=1990|team=Louisiana Tech Bulldogs|title=Louisiana Tech}} in the {{alternate links|1990 Independence Bowl|Independence Bowl|title=1990 Independence Bowl}}, he had thrown 225 completed passes in 418 attempts for 2,589&nbsp;yards and 10 touchdowns.<ref>{{cite news|title=Maryland's Defense Will Get Tested|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 15, 1990|page=18}}</ref> The teams tied, 34&ndash;34, in Zolak's final collegiate appearance.

He was also named [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] Offensive Player of the Week four times.<ref name=patriots/>

==Professional career==
===New England Patriots===
With the 84th pick in the fourth round of the [[1991 NFL Draft|1991]] [[NFL Draft]], Zolak was selected by the [[New England Patriots]]. Scouting reports noted that his size and arm strength were great for the NFL, though there were concerns about his accuracy.<ref>{{cite news|url=Quarterback not among Bears' priorities|work=Chicago Tribune|first=Fred|last=Mitchell|date=April 18, 1991|page=3}}</ref> Upon drafting him, Patriots Vice President of Player Operations Joe Mendes agreed that his size and arm would translate to the NFL, and he was not worried about any accuracy issues.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BB0hAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_GMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2505,762677|title='Lucky' Zolak set to battle for Patriots job|first=Sam|last=Tallarico|work=[[The Pittsburgh Press]]|date=June 2, 1991|page=W11}}</ref> His drafting led to a shakeup with the Patriots' current quarterbacks, as [[Marc Wilson (American football)|Marc Wilson]] announced his retirement and longtime starting quarterback [[Steve Grogan]] was released.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ex-Patriot Grogan seeks backup role|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=April 30, 1991|page=6c}}</ref> Zolak agreed on a contract with the Patriots in July, and was the second-to-last person to [[:wikt:hold out|hold out]] after [[Leonard Russell]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Ron|last=Borges|title=Russell Is Last Rookie Holdout|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=July 19, 1991|page=41}}</ref> Zolak spent the [[1991 New England Patriots season|1991 season]] as the third-string quarterback, behind [[Hugh Millen]] and [[Tom Hodson]], and did not take the field.<ref name=patriots/>

At the start of the [[1992 New England Patriots season|1992 season]], Zolak also looked unlikely to appear, being behind Hodson and Millen on the [[depth chart]]. Millen started the first five games before being injured, and then Hodson became the starter. In early November, Zolak made his professional debut in the fourth quarter against the [[New Orleans Saints]]. Relieving Hodson, he completed five of nine passes and threw an interception as the Patriots lost, 31&ndash;14.<ref>{{cite news|first=Terry|last=Price|title=Zolak likely to get the ball Patriots will take a look at third-string quarterback Zolak set to start|work=[[The Hartford Courant]]|page=E1|date=November 10, 1992}}</ref> The next week, Zolak made his first career start when the still winless Patriots faced the [[Indianapolis Colts]].

He completed seven of 16 passes for 102&nbsp;yards, getting help from [[Jon Vaughn]] who had 110 rushing yards, and the Patriots won, 24&ndash;3.<ref>{{cite news|first=Terry|last=Price|title=Patience rewarded for Zolak, Vaughn|work=Hartford Courant|date=November 23, 1992|page=D5}}</ref> However, the following week's performance against the [[Atlanta Falcons]] was less impressive.

However, Millen suffered a shoulder injury against the Colts, and after Zolak played part of the game against Indianapolis, he again became the starter for the game against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Joe|last=Cunningham|title=Surprising Chargers Next Test For Klingler|work=[[Dayton Daily News]]|page=11D|date=December 13, 1992}}</ref> Zolak injured his ankle at the end of the third quarter, making the appearance against Kansas City his last for the season as [[Jeff Carlson (American football)|Jeff Carlson]] took over quarterbacking duties.<ref>{{cite news|first=Dan|last=Caesar|title=Farewell Finale|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|page=3C|date=December 14, 1992}}</ref> Zolak finished the season with 52 pass completions in 100 attempts, 561&nbsp;yards, two touchdowns, four interceptions, and a [[quarterback rating]] of 58.8.<ref name=pfr>{{cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/Z/ZolaSc00.htm|title=Scott Zolak Statistics|work=Pro-Football-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=2009-05-29}}</ref> 

In 1993, the Patriots and new head coach [[Bill Parcells]] were looking to improve the quarterback spot on their roster. They signed [[Scott Secules]], and attempted to sign [[Steve Beuerlein]], but the latter deal did not happen. They also gave Hugh Millen permission to seek a trade.<ref>{{cite news|first=Terry|last=Price|title=Patriots give up on Millen|work=The Hartford Courant|page=C2|date=March 25, 1993}}</ref> In April, Millen was traded to the [[Dallas Cowboys]], and the Patriots chose [[Drew Bledsoe]] with the first pick in the [[1993 NFL Draft]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Cowboys obtain Millen to fill quarterback void|work=[[The Victoria Advocate]]|page=1B|date=April 27, 1993}}</ref> During the offseason, Carlson was released, leaving Secules, Zolak, Bledsoe, and Hodson to compete for the three spots on the roster. By the end of the preseason, Bledsoe had won the starting job and Hodson had been cut, with Secules as the backup and Zolak as the third-string quarterback.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=I18gAAAAIBAJ&sjid=hmUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4892,4786337|title=Pats send Hodson packing; Baker Giant casualty|work=[[Sun Journal (Lewiston)|Sun Journal]]|page=23|date=August 24, 1993}}</ref> Zolak saw playing time in three games in 1993, and threw two incomplete passes.<ref name=pfr/> He became a [[restricted free agent]] in the offseason, but re-signed with the Patriots for three years.<ref>{{cite news|first=Ron|last=Borges|title=Patriots Re-sign Coates Harlow In The Fold, Too|work=The Boston Globe|date=April 2, 1994|page=61}}</ref> As Secules was released during preseason, Zolak was set as Bledsoe's backup as the 1994 season began. As was the case in the 1993 season, he did not make a starting appearance, as Bledsoe played the full 16 games, however Zolak did see action in every game, primarily as the [[holder (American football)|holder]] for extra point and [[field goal (football)|field goal]] attempts. Over the course of the season, he completed five of eight passes for 28&nbsp;yards in the two games in which he saw time at quarterback.<ref name=pfr/> The [[1995 New England Patriots season|1995 season]] was similar, with Bledsoe starting and Zolak backing him up. In September, Bledsoe separated his left shoulder in a game and sat out a week to heal, allowing Zolak to make his first start since 1992.<ref>{{cite news|title=Patriots' Bledsoe To Miss Falcons|work=Chicago Tribune|date=September 27, 1995|page=6}}</ref> On October 1, 1995, Zolak took the field against the Atlanta Falcons, and completed 24 of 45 passes for 252&nbsp;yards and a touchdown, though the Patriots lost the game, 30&ndash;17.<ref>{{cite news|first=Mark|last=Potash|title=First-Rate Play by Second-String Quarterbacks|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=October 2, 1995|page=83}}</ref> Although Bledsoe's doctors wanted him to sit out another week, he refused and played the next week's game against the [[Denver Broncos]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Ron|last=Borges|title=Bledsoe Wants In Sunday Against Doctor's Advice, He Says He's Ready To Go|work=The Boston Globe|date=October 5, 1995|page=90}}</ref> This again relegated Zolak to the backup position, where he remained for the rest of the season. He finished the season with 28 completed passes in 49 attempts for 282&nbsp;yards, a touchdown, and a quarterback rating of 80.5.<ref name=pfr/>

[[File:Bledsoephoto.jpg|thumb|left|Scott Zolak was the backup quarterback for Drew Bledsoe (''pictured'') for the majority of his career.]]
The [[1996 New England Patriots season|1996 season]] began well for Zolak, whose contract was extended through 1998.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/03/sports/transactions-093130.html|title=Transactions|work=The New York Times|page=C8|date=June 3, 1996}}</ref> However, to remain with the Patriots, Zolak took a $250,000 pay cut to work around the [[salary cap]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Terry|last=Price|title=Zolak Knows From Start With Patriots, He's Second To Bledsoe And Accepts It|work=The Hartford Courant|page=C3|date=August 28, 1996}}</ref> While he appeared set to keep his backup job heading into training camp, he faced tough competition from [[Jay Barker]]. While Zolak welcomed the challenge, his status as the backup quarterback began to seem uncertain a few weeks into training camp.<ref>{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Madden|title=Zolak Won't Dwell On Idle Thoughts|work=The Boston Globe|date=August 16, 1996|page=E2}}</ref> By the end of training camp, Barker had been cut, and Zolak's quarterback job was safe. He took the role of emergency quarterback throughout the 1996 season, with Bledsoe taking nearly all the snaps and [[Tom Tupa]] serving as the backup upon his signing. Zolak played in three games, completing one pass for five yards.<ref name=pfr/> He saw some playing time in the playoffs against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], but did not play in [[Super Bowl XXXI]]. Parcells ordered Zolak to lose weight, which Zolak did throughout much of the season.<ref>{{cite news|first=Nick|last=Cafardo|title=If Need Be, Martin Ready To Carry Day|work=The Boston Globe|date=January 5, 1997|page=E9}}</ref> The 1997 season was more of the same for Zolak, backing up Bledsoe, though the Patriots did have a new coach in [[Pete Carroll]]. As training camp ended, Zolak gained significantly more playing time during drills and the preseason matchups then he had under Parcells.<ref>{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Solloway|title=Pats' Zolak Not Itchy After Seven Years|work=[[Portland Press Herald]]|page=1D|date=August 29, 1997}}</ref> As the regular season came and went, however, he had minimal playing time. Zolak saw action in four games, completing six of nine passes for 67&nbsp;yards and two touchdowns, giving him a quarterback rating of 128.2.<ref name=pfr/>

With Zolak coming to the final year of his contract in [[1998 New England Patriots season|1998]], he sat in his usual spot on the depth chart, in between starter Bledsoe and third stringer Tupa. He saw playing time in three games during the first three months of the season in relief of Bledsoe. His most significant appearance during this time came against the Atlanta Falcons on November 8, 1998, where he completed three of ten passes for 33&nbsp;yards and an interception in a 41&ndash;10 loss.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mathis Impresses Reeves, Falcon Does Great Job Of Blocking|work=Worcester Telegram & Gazette|date=November 9, 1998}}</ref> Near the end of the month, Bledsoe was sidelined with an injury and was questionable for the final November game.<ref>{{cite news|first=Nick|last=Cafardo|title=Quarterback Options Weighed Zolak May Have Chance To Take A Hike|work=The Boston Globe|date=November 26, 1998|page=C1}}</ref> Bledsoe played in three more games, but his injury kept him from playing in the final two, giving Zolak his first starting appearance since 1995.<ref>{{cite news|title=NFL Notebook: Pro Bowl; White Is Picked For the 13th Time|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/17/sports/nfl-notebook-pro-bowl-white-is-picked-for-the-13th-time.html|work=The New York Times|page=D6|date=December 17, 1998}}</ref> Zolak's first start came against the [[San Francisco 49ers]] on December 20.

===Miami Dolphins===
After leaving the Patriots, Zolak was signed to a one-year contract by the [[New York Jets]].<ref name=jets/> With [[Vinny Testaverde]] considered the starter, Zolak was competing against [[Ray Lucas]] for a backup job. He was the second-string quarterback as training camp began, but his competition increased when the Jets signed [[Rick Mirer]] and left three quarterbacks to battle for two open spots on the team.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/08/21/archive/main34421.shtml|title=Jets Squeeze By Eagles|work=[[CBS News]]|date=August 21, 1999}}</ref> Two days after acquiring Mirer from the [[Green Bay Packers]], the Jets released Zolak.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jets Cut Scott Zolak|work=United Press International|date=August 22, 1999}}</ref> In October, Zolak was signed to a one-year deal by the [[Miami Dolphins]] to serve as the backup quarterback behind [[Damon Huard]] and [[Jim Druckenmiller]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Zolak Is Signed As 3rd-String QB|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|page=3D|date=October 28, 1999}}</ref> He was later made the backup behind Huard, and made his only appearance of the season on November 21, failing to complete a pass in four attempts against the Patriots.<ref name=pfr/> As the 1999 season wrapped up, the Dolphins signed Zolak to a contract extension, keeping him on the team for another year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Zolak Signs Extension|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|page=D3|date=December 18, 1999}}</ref> Despite the retirement of [[Dan Marino]], the Dolphins cut Zolak in May 2000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dolphins Release QB Zolak|work=The Miami Herald|page=2D|date=May 23, 2000}}</ref> Zolak trained for the [[Detroit Lions]] during the summer after they lost [[Mike Tomczak]] for the season, but instead he signed on as a host for Patriots Gameday alongside [[Bob Lobel]] in August, ending his professional football career.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jim|last=Greenidge|title=Sign Him Up For One More Year; Santos is Not Ready to Retire - Just Yet|work=The Boston Globe|page=E15|date=August 25, 2000}}</ref>

==Life after football==
Zolak resides in [[Massachusetts]] with his wife Amy and his three children (Hadley, Samantha, and Brody). His daughter, Samantha, was diagnosed with [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|Type 1 diabetes]], and Zolak has since been investigating causes of the disease.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thebostonchannel.com/r/19022121/detail.html|title=Suburban 'Diabetes Clusters' Prompt Study|work=[[The Boston Channel]]|date=March 27, 2009|accessdate=May 30, 2011}}</ref>

After retirement, Zolak became a co-host of a morning sports radio talk show on [[Rhode Island]] sportstalk station "The Score" ([[WPRV|WSKO/790]] & [[WEAN-FM|WSKO-FM/99.7]]) until the show was canceled in 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bostonherald.com/track/inside_track/view.bg?articleid=1079662|title=Settling score: Scott Zolak and Andy Gresh out|work=[[Boston Herald]]|date=March 12, 2008|accessdate=2009-06-04}}</ref> He was also a football analyst for the [[CBS College Sports Network]], as well as on the New England sports program ''[[Out of Bounds (TV show)|Out of Bounds]]'' on the [[Comcast]] channel hosted by [[Gregg Murphy]].
