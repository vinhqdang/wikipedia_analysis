'''''The Human Centipede (First Sequence)''''' is a <!-- The Human Centipede was released in the USA theatrically on 30 April 2010.

These 2009 screenings were previews. The IMDB is also wrong about this and it should be noted that the IMDB is not considered a reputable source on Wikipedia. Thanks. -->2010 Dutch [[body horror]] film written and directed by [[Tom Six]]. The film tells the story of a German doctor who kidnaps three tourists and joins them surgically, mouth to [[Human anus|anus]], forming a "human [[centipede]]". It stars [[Dieter Laser]] as the villain, Dr. Heiter, with [[Ashley C. Williams]], [[Ashlynn Yennie]], and [[Akihiro Kitamura]] as his victims. According to Six, the concept of the film arose from a joke he made with friends about punishing child molesters by stitching their mouths to the anus of a "fat truck driver." Six also stated that inspiration for the film came from [[Nazi medical experiments]] carried out during [[World War II]], such as the actions of [[Josef Mengele]] at [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].

When approaching investors prior to filming, Six did not mention the mouth-to-anus aspect of the plot, fearing it would put off potential backers. The financiers of ''The Human Centipede'' did not discover the full nature of the film until it was complete. The film received mixed reviews from mainstream film critics, but it won several accolades at international film festivals. The film was released in the United States on a [[limited release]] theatrically on 30 April. A sequel, ''[[The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)]]'', also written and directed by Six, was released in 2011.

==Plot==
Lindsay (Ashley C. Williams) and Jenny (Ashlynn Yennie), two American tourists in Germany, are drugged and kidnapped by crazed surgeon Dr. Heiter (Dieter Laser) when they seek help after their car breaks down. The women awake in a makeshift medical ward. They witness Heiter kill a kidnapped truck driver (Rene de Wit) after Heiter informs him he is "not a match". When the women wake up a second time, Heiter has secured a new male captive, Japanese tourist Katsuro (Akihiro Kitamura). The doctor explains that he is a world-renowned expert at separating [[conjoined twins]], but dreams of making new creatures by sewing people together. He describes in detail how he will surgically connect his three victims mouth-to-anus, so that they share a single [[Digestion|digestive system]]. After Lindsay fails in an attempt to escape, Heiter explains to Lindsay that he had previously experimented with creating what he called a "three-dog", also joined mouth-to-anus. The three-dog however died shortly after surgery. Heiter tells Lindsay that the middle dog of his creation experienced the most pain, and as a punishment for her escape attempt she will become the middle part of his centipede. Heiter performs the surgery on his victims, placing Katsuro at the front, Lindsay in the middle and Jenny at the rear. During his procedure Heiter severs the ligaments in his victims' knees so they cannot stand and are forced to crawl, and sticks the victims together in a line with their mouths surgically attached to the person in front's anus.

Once the operation is complete Heiter attempts to train his centipede as a pet. During one such session, he watches with great delight as Lindsay is forced to swallow Katsuro's excrement. However, he eventually becomes irritated after being kept awake by the constant screaming of Katsuro (who as the front part of the centipede has his mouth free and is still able to speak) and the realisation that Jenny is dying from [[Sepsis|blood poisoning]]. When two detectives, Kranz (Andreas Leupold) and Voller (Peter Blankenstein), visit the house to investigate the disappearance of tourists, Heiter decides to add them to his centipede as replacements for Jenny. Heiter fails in an attempt to drug the detectives, and they leave the house to obtain a search warrant. The victims attempt to escape from the ward, crawling up the stairs, and Katsuro attacks Heiter. Their attempt to escape ultimately fails. Katsuro confesses to the doctor, in Japanese, that he deserves his fate because he had treated his family poorly. Katsuro then commits suicide by slitting his own throat with a piece of glass. The detectives return to the house and conduct separate searches, as Heiter hides near his swimming pool. Kranz finds the makeshift ward and then hears a gunshot. He discovers Heiter's victims before finding Voller dead in the swimming pool. Heiter shoots Kranz in the stomach, and Kranz responds by shooting Heiter in the head. Kranz then falls in the pool, dead. Back in the house, Jenny and Lindsay hold hands as Jenny dies from her infection. Lindsay is left alone in the house, trapped between her deceased fellow captives.

==Production== 
===Writing===
The inspiration for ''The Human Centipede'''s plot came from a joke that writer/director Tom Six once made to his friends about punishing a child molester they saw on TV by stitching his mouth to the anus of an overweight truck driver.<ref name = "entertainment weekly tom six interview" /> Six saw this as the concept for a great horror film, and he began to develop the idea.<ref>Berge Garabedian, Sitges 09 Interview, 0:25<U+2013>0:47</ref> He has said he was heavily influenced as a filmmaker by the early works of [[David Cronenberg]] and [[Japanese horror|Japanese horror films]].<ref>Mr Disgusting.

Retrieved 8 May 2010.</ref> Six has said he prefers horror films that are more realistic over "unbelievable"<ref name="paste magazine tom six interview"/> monster films, and said that he "(gets) a rash from too much political correctness."<ref name = "ebert chicago sun times review" /> Major influences for ''The Human Centipede'' were [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s controversial 1975 Italian drama film ''[[Sal<U+00F2>, or the 120 Days of Sodom]]'', which was notable for its scenes depicting intensely graphic violence, sadism, and sexual depravity, as was the work of Japanese director [[Takashi Miike]].<ref name = "'guardian human centipede 3 in 1" /> Six has also expressed his love of the works of [[David Lynch]].<ref>Jason Solomons, Film Weekly... 9:05<U+2013>9:15</ref> Further inspiration came from Six's previous work as a director on the Dutch series of ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', where he had been able to observe people who "did crazy things when they were alone and thought they were not (being) watched".<ref>Jason Solomons, Film Weekly... 6:06<U+2013>7:00</ref>

Six has stated that ''The Human Centipede'' is, to an extent, a reflection on fascism. [[Dieter Laser]], who played the antagonist Dr. Heiter, said during the promotion of the film that he felt the guilt of Nazi actions during the war had haunted ordinary Germans for generations, and that as a German whose father participated in the war, he often felt "like a child whose father is in jail for murder."<ref name="tom six dieter laser DVD Q&A" /> The inclusion of a German villain came from this, with Six citing both the [[German invasion of the Netherlands]] during [[World War II]] and the [[Nazi medical experiments]] as inspiration.<ref>Berge Garabedian, Sitges 09 Interview, 1:00<U+2013>1:23</ref> Laser stated in a interview with Clark Collis for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that he considered the film a "grotesque [parody] about the Nazi psyche."<ref name = "entertainment weekly tom six interview" /> Heiter's name was an amalgamation of several Nazi war criminals, his surname a combination of the names of Nazi doctors Fetter and Richter, and his first name coming from [[Josef Mengele]], who carried out [[Auschwitz concentration camp#Medical experiments|experiments on prisoners]] at [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 27:15<U+2013>27:37</ref> World War II also played an influence on the nationality of the other main characters who were American and Japanese.<ref>Stuart O'Connor, FrightFest Interview, 0:30<U+2013>1:15</ref> Six includes many horror film clich<U+00E9>s in the first act, such as a broken-down car, lack of [[Mobile phone signal|phone signal]]<ref>Jason Solomons, Film Weekly... 4:15<U+2013>4:40</ref> and very na<U+00EF>ve victims.<ref name="paste magazine tom six interview"/> Six did this in an attempt to lull audiences into thinking they are watching a conventional horror film, therefore making Dr. Heiter's treatment of his victims more shocking.<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 5:30<U+2013>6:08</ref> Six placed a Japanese male at the front of the centipede for two reasons: first to create a [[language barrier]] between the doctor and the centipede. Throughout the film the characters (with the exception of Heiter who for the most part speaks to the centipede in English) speak in their native languages only (subtitled for the viewer into English where necessary). Katsuro, as the front part of the centipede, can only speak Japanese and therefore cannot speak with either the doctor or Jenny and Lindsay. Secondly, Katsuro's position in the centipede sets up the opportunity for the doctor and the male victim of the centipede to fight toward the climax of the film.<ref>Mr Disgusting, Tom Six Answers Your Questions, 9:17<U+2013>9:36</ref> Six stated in the director's commentary for ''The Human Centipede'' that he has a personal fear of hospitals and doctors, so he stretched out the scene where Heiter explains how he will create the centipede and the subsequent procedure in order to create his "own nightmare".<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 30:32<U+2013>30:53</ref>

While seeking funding for the film, Six pitched the idea of a surgeon who sewed people together.<ref name="ReferenceA">Mr Disgusting, Tom Six Answers Your Questions, 1:20<U+2013>1:48</ref>  He did not initially reveal that the victims would be joined mouth-to-anus, as he believed this idea would stand no chance of receiving investments.<ref>Berge Garabedian, Sitges 09 Interview, 1:55<U+2013>2:01</ref> His backers felt that the idea of a surgeon sewing people together was original and Six received funding.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> However, they did not learn the exact details of the film until it had been completed.<ref name = "entertainment weekly tom six interview" /> Six claimed they were very happy with the finished film.<ref>Berge Garabedian, Sitges 09 Interview, 2:00<U+2013>2:10</ref> Before signing on, the actors were given an outline of the [[storyboard]] rather than a complete script.<ref name = "BloodyDisgusting-Williams" /> They were also shown sketches of how the centipede would be formed.<ref name = "BloodyDisgusting-Williams" />

===Filming===
Although ''The Human Centipede'' is set in Germany, filming took place in the Netherlands due to the countries' similar landscapes.<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 0:45<U+2013>0:53</ref> Heiter's home, where most of ''The Human Centipede'' takes place, was a villa in the Netherlands found by the production team. The property was in a residential area and not surrounded by woodland as it appears in the film, but by other houses. This meant the filmmakers had some difficulty ensuring the other houses did not appear in shot.<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 12:03<U+2013>12:24</ref> Some conversion of the property took place prior to filming, for example, a cinema room was converted to form Heiter's basement operating theatre,<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 17:50<U+2013>18:15</ref> with real hospital beds and intravenous drips rented from a local hospital.<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 21:40<U+2013>21:48</ref> The paintings of conjoined twins that were displayed throughout the house were painted by Tom Six, which he felt contributed to the atmosphere in the house.<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 15:10<U+2013>15:43</ref> The hotel room scene near the beginning of the film was filmed in a hotel suite at a location near [[Amsterdam]].<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 3:30<U+2013>3:40</ref> The film was shot almost entirely in sequence, which Yennie stated helped the actors to develop their characters throughout the film.<ref name = "BloodyDisgusting-Yennie"/> The opening scene, which only featured Laser and de Wit, was shot on the last day of filming.<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 2:29<U+2013>2:35</ref>

Laser remained in character as Heiter during the filming process, often shouting at the rest of the cast on set,<ref name = "24xps Akihiro Kitamura interview" /> but wherever possible staying away from the other actors and crew between scenes to preserve a level of separation.<ref>Dan Persons.

For example, when Heiter is explaining his procedure to his victims, Katsuro's dialogue was improvised, which pleased Laser.<ref name = "24xps Akihiro Kitamura interview" /> During filming Laser accidentally kicked Kitamuro (Katsuro), leading to a fight on set between the actors. The incident contributed to the tension and anger throughout the scene they were filming, in which Heiter sits at his dining table eating while the centipede eats dog food from the floor alongside him.<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 53:15<U+2013>53:48</ref> Laser also hurt Williams during the scene when Heiter roughly grabs and injects Lindsay, which caused a pause in shooting before the filmmakers could continue.<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 20:09<U+2013>20:27</ref>

The Nazi influence behind Heiter led to the use of classical music when the doctor is "training" his centipede. The music was deliberately played at low quality to simulate the music coming from a loudspeaker, in much the same way as music was sometimes played in [[Nazi concentration camps]].<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 51:20<U+2013>51:41</ref> Many of the sound effects in ''The Human Centipede'' were created by manipulating meat. For example, the sound of a nose being broken was made by snapping bones within cuts of raw meat.<ref name="The Human Centipede DVD foley session" /> Due to the discomfort of spending long periods on their hands and knees, the actors playing the centipede were given massages at the end of each day of filming.<ref>Dan Persons, Mighty Movie Podcast, 15:30<U+2013>15:40</ref> Yennie stated that she and Williams experienced jaw pain from holding a [[Bit (horse)|bit]] in their mouths during filming, but overall she did not feel that the physical side of filming had been excessively difficult.<ref>Stuart O'Connor, FrightFest Interview, 2:33<U+2013>2:53</ref>

==Promotion and release==
===Promotion===
During promotion for ''The Human Centipede'', press materials claimed the film was "100% medically accurate."<ref name = "washington post human centipede review"/> Six and the producers frequently stated that the film had been described as "the most horrific film ever made",<ref name = "'guardian the most horrific film ever?" /> and many writers, such as Karina Longworth of ''[[LA Weekly]]'' magazine<ref name = "LA Weekly man girl inter" /> and Jay Stone of the ''[[Calgary Herald]]''<ref name = "jay stone calgary herald review" /> described the film as [[torture porn]]. [[Roger Ebert]], writing in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' stated he felt the film had been "deliberately intended to inspire incredulity, nausea and hopefully outrage."<ref name = "ebert chicago sun times review" /> However, writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', David Cox noted that he had been unable to trace the source of this quote as the "most horrific ever made" and had contacted Six to attempt to ascertain the origin of this judgement.<ref name = "'guardian the most horrific film ever?" /> Six claimed the statement had originally been made by ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper in the United Kingdom. However, Cox was unable to trace any article making this claim. When asked by Cox as to what Six regarded as the "most horrific" film, Six stated he in fact believed it to be Pier Paolo Pasolini's ''Sal<U+00F2>, or the 120 Days of Sodom''.<ref name = "'guardian the most horrific film ever?" />

To Six's amusement, Spanish audiences often found the film funny, and laughed throughout screenings.<ref>Berge Garabedian, Sitges 09 Interview, 3:55<U+2013>4:30</ref> Six claimed that the "buzz"<ref name="ReferenceB">Berge Garabedian, Sitges 09 Interview, 4:35<U+2013>4:50</ref> surrounding the film led to several studios approaching him to discuss its distribution.<ref name="ReferenceB" /> IFC Films has a history of releasing unconventional horror films, having previously distributed the Norwegian Nazi-zombie feature ''[[Dead Snow]]'' and the 2009 release ''[[Antichrist (film)|Antichrist]]''.<ref name = "BloodyDisgusting-IFC distro news" /> ''The Human Centipede''{{'}}s US gross was $181,467, and worldwide takings amounted to $252,207.<ref name = "human centipede box office mojo" />

==Reception==
===Critical===
''The Human Centipede'' generally received mixed reviews.<ref name = "human centipede 3tv news banned" /> [[Review aggregator]] web site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film a 50% 'Rotten' rating, based upon 90 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2 out of 10.<ref name = "rotten tomatoes thc review" /> Among Rotten Tomatoes "Top Critics", which only considers the views of mainstream film critics, the film received a slightly lower rating of 44%. With an average rating of 4.5 from 9 reviews.<ref name = "rotten tomatoes thc review" />  At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 33% based on 15 reviews.<ref name = "metacritic human centipede" />

Giving the film three stars out of five, ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' writer Kim Newman stated that "underneath an extremely repulsive concept, this is a relatively conventional horror movie."<ref name = "human centipede empire review" /> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety Magazine]]'' writer Peter DeBurge <!-- Please note this article is in British English -->criticised the film's lack of any form of social commentary, stating that it could not "be bothered to expand upon its unpleasant premise, inviting audiences to revel in its sick humor by favoring Dr. Heiter ... and characterizing the victims as shallow expendables."<ref name = "variety human centipede review" /> Writing in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Clark Collis was broadly positive about Dieter Laser's performance as the Doctor, and praised Six's direction, saying Six "has put together his nightmare yarn with [[David Cronenberg|Cronenbergian]] care and precision."<ref name = "''Entertainment Weekly'' human centipede review" /> Collis said ''The Human Centipede'' was "without question one of the most disgusting horror films ever made."<ref name = "''Entertainment Weekly'' human centipede review" /> Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Peter Bradshaw]] gave the film three out of five, saying that whilst "entirely deplorable and revolting" the film was "sort of brilliant".<ref name = "'guardian film human centipede review" />

Sukhdev Sandhu in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' was generally negative about the film, stating, "''The Human Centipede'' has its moments, but they<U+2019>re largely obscured by umpteen holes in the plot as well as by reams of exposition"<ref name = "The Human Centipede - Daily telegraph Review" /> and that it was "an ultimately underwhelming affair that<U+2019>s neither sick or repellent enough to garner the cult status it so craves."<ref name = "The Human Centipede - Daily telegraph Review" /> ''[[Total Film]]'' writer Jamie Graham described the film as a disappointment that "proved itself to be a slow-moving, repetitive affair that has nowhere left to go by the hour mark."<ref name = "Total Film - Human Centipede Fest Review"/> ''[[The New York Times]]'' review by Jeannette Catsouli noted that it was unsure if the film was "a commentary on Nazi atrocities or a literal expression of filmmaking politics, [but] the grotesque fusion at least silences the female leads, both of whose voices could strip paint."<ref name = "new york times human centipede review" /> Writing in the ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] did not assign the film a star rating (as opposed to awarding it zero stars), stating, "I am required to award stars to movies I review. This time, I refuse to do it. The star rating system is unsuited to this film. Is the movie good? Is it bad? Does it matter? It is what it is and occupies a world where the stars don't shine."<ref name = "ebert chicago sun times review" />

Critics and a physician have dismissed Six's claim that the film was "100 percent medically accurate" as "ludicrous"<ref name = "Film-Threat editor says film's concept ludicrous" /> and "rubbish."<ref>David Farrier. [http://www.3news.co.nz/Full-interview-with-Human-Centipede-doctor/tabid/312/articleID/173793/Default.aspx"Full interview with Human Centipede doctor <U+2013> Video"]. ''[[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]]''. [[MediaWorks New Zealand]]. Event occurs at 0:03<U+2013>0:07. Retrieved 5 Sep 2010.</ref> Dr John Cameron, speaking to [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]] News in [[New Zealand]] gave an interview about the feasibility of a human centipede, stating how he believed it would be difficult for a join between different people to heal and form a connection, and how the centipede would quickly die from lack of nutrition.<ref>David Farrier, Full Interview with Human Centipede doctor, 1:11<U+2013>1:51</ref> John Martin, a former Hollywood film executive and CEO of [[Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas]] said Six's claims of 100 percent medical accuracy should be viewed with reference to the kind of shock gimmicks that film producers had long used to attract attention. Martin compared Six's claims to those of H. Kroger Babb and [[William Castle]] who had also made "grand promises" about what they were putting on screen in a bid to lure audiences.<ref name = "Film-Threat editor says film's concept ludicrous" />

===Accolades===
Despite mixed reviews, the film won several awards in 2009 during advance screenings at various international horror film festivals, including Best Picture/Movie at [[Fantastic Fest]] ([[Austin, Texas|Austin]], Texas), [[Screamfest Horror Film Festival]] (Los Angeles), and the Sainte Maxime International Horror Film Festival.<ref name = "'human centipede production notes" /> Laser won Best Actor in the horror category at Fantastic Fest and the film won the award for Best Ensemble Cast at the South African Horrorfest Film Festival.<ref name = "'human centipede production notes" />

==Sequel==
{{Main|The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)}}
While promoting ''The Human Centipede'', Six stated that he had started work on a [[sequel]] to ''First Sequence'', titled ''[[The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)]]''. Shooting on a similar budget to the first film,<ref>Jason Solomons, Film Weekly... 10:45<U+2013>10:53</ref> Six stated the sequel would be a much more graphic and disturbing film; ''First Sequence'' being "''[[My Little Pony]]'' compared with part two."<ref>Jason Solomons, Film Weekly... 10:35<U+2013>10:45</ref> Yennie stated at the May 2010 [[Fangoria's Weekend of Horrors|Weekend of Horrors]] that the sequel would contain "the blood and shit"<ref name = "dreadcentral-weekend-of-horrors-may-2010 2" /> that viewers did not see in the first film.<ref name = "dreadcentral-weekend-of-horrors-may-2010 2" /> The plot of ''Full Sequence'' involved a centipede made from twelve people, featured a largely British cast and was given the tag-line "''100% medically inaccurate.''"<ref>Jason Solomons, Film Weekly... 10:10<U+2013>10:30</ref>

The plot of ''Full Sequence'' involves a man who after becoming sexually obsessed with a DVD recording of ''First Sequence'' decides to create his own human centipede. The film had been planned for a DVD release in the United Kingdom. However, upon submitting the film to the BBFC for classification, the film was rejected due to content that was "sexually violent and potentially obscene."<ref name = "Total Film - Human Centipede II banned" /> The BBFC's report <!-- Please note this article is in British English -->criticised the film as making "little attempt to portray any of the victims in the film as anything other than objects to be brutalised, degraded and mutilated for the amusement and arousal of the central character, as well as for the pleasure of the audience"<ref name = "BBFC banning thc2 press release" /> and that the film was potentially in breach of the [[Obscene Publications Act]], meaning its distribution in the UK would be illegal.<ref name = "BBFC banning thc2 press release" /> Bounty Films, the UK distributor, appealed the decision, and the film was eventually passed with an 18 certificate in October 2011. In order to achieve the 18 rating 32 cuts were made from the film, removing 2 minutes 37 seconds from the film.<ref name = "'guardian thc2 no longer banned" />

==Parodies==
A number of parodies of the film have been made. A pornographic parody, directed by [[Lee Roy Myers]] and titled ''[[The Human Sexipede]]'', was released in September 2010.<ref name = "AVN-human sexipede" /> It starred [[Tom Byron]] as Heiter, who joined three people mouth-to-genitals.<ref name = "AVN-human sexipede" /> The ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[HumancentiPad|HUMANCENTiPAD]]" saw character [[Kyle Broflovski]] unwittingly agreeing to become a part of a human centipede after failing to read the full details of an [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Software license agreement|user license agreement]].<ref name = "South Park: Season 15 Premiere"/> The web site ''[[FunnyOrDie]]'' featured a sketch where the freed victims of a human centipede, now separated, but scarred physically and mentally, argue at a survivors' meeting.<ref name = "Human Centipede Anonymous" />
