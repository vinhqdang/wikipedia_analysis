'''Amarillo''' is the 14th-largest city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]] and the [[county seat]] of [[Potter County, Texas|Potter County]].<ref>{{cite web | author =Texas State Library / U.S. Census Bureau | url = http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ref/abouttx/popcity32000.html | title = 2000 Census: Population of Texas Cities | accessdate = 2006-11-22}}</ref>  A portion of the city extends into [[Randall County, Texas|Randall County]]. As of the 2000 [[U.S. Census]], the city had a total population of 173,627 (though a [[July 1]], [[2005]] estimate placed the city's population at 183,021). The [[List of Texas metropolitan areas|Amarillo metropolitan area]], however, has an estimated population of 236,113 in four counties.

Amarillo was originally named Oneida. The city was once [[List of city nicknames in the United States|self-proclaimed]] as the "[[Helium]] Capital of the World" for having one of the country's most productive helium fields.<ref>{{cite web | publisher=Wired | title=A Helium Shortage?  | url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.08/helium.html| date=[[August]], [[2000]] | accessdate=4 February | accessyear=2007}}</ref> The city is also known as "The Yellow Rose of Texas" and most recently "Rotor City, USA" for its [[V-22 Osprey]] hybrid aircraft assembly plant.<ref>{{cite web | author = Amarillo Economic Development Corporation | url = http://www.amarilloedc.com/index.php?id=125 | title = What Is Rotor City, USA | accessdate = 2006-01-28}}</ref> Amarillo operates one of the largest [[Meat packing industry|meat packing]] areas in the United States. [[Pantex]], the only [[nuclear weapon]]s assembly and disassembly facility in the country, is also a major employer. The attractions, [[Cadillac Ranch]] and [[The Big Texan Steak Ranch|Big Texan Steak Ranch]], were located on the former [[U.S. Route 66]], which passes through the city.

==History==
In April 1887, J. T. Berry established a site for a town after he chose a well-watered section along the way of the [[Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad]], which had begun building across the [[Texas Panhandle]]. Berry and [[Colorado City, Texas]] merchants wanted to make their new town site the region's main trading center. On [[August 30]], [[1887]], Berry's town site won the [[county seat]] election and was established in Potter County. Availability of the [[railroad]] and [[freight]] service after the county seat election made the town a fast growing [[cattle]] marketing center.<ref name="handbook">{{Handbook of Texas|id=AA/hda2|name=Amarillo}}. Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[January 25|01-25]].</ref>

The settlement originally was called Oneida; it would later change its name to Amarillo. Amarillo's name probably derives from yellow wildflowers that were plentiful during the spring and summer or the nearby Amarillo Lake and Amarillo Creek, named in turn for the yellow soil along their banks and shores (''Amarillo'' is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for the color ''yellow''). Despite having a name of Spanish origin, the City of Amarillo is pronounced in [[English language|English]] as "Am-ah-RILL-oh" rather than "Ah-mah-REE-yoh". Early residents pronounced it according to the Spanish pronunciation, but within a year, the English pronunciation prevailed. Charles F. Rudolph, editor of the ''Tascosa Pioneer'', predicted the pronunciation change after blaming Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad employees for ignoring the word's Spanish pronunciation.<ref>Hammond, Clara T., comp. ''Amarillo'' (1974). pg. 6. George Autry, Printer, Amarillo, Texas.</ref>

On [[June 19]], [[1888]], Henry B. Sanborn, who is given credit as the "Father of Amarillo,"<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |author=Everett, Liz |title=History Makers of the High Plains: H.B. Sanborn |date=May 19, 2000 |publisher=[[Amarillo Globe-News]] |url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/051900/his_sanborn.html |accessdate = 2007-01-25}}</ref> and his business partner [[Joseph Glidden|Joseph F. Glidden]] began buying land to the east to move Amarillo after arguing that Berry's site was on low ground and would flood during rainstorms. Sanborn also offered to trade lots in the new location to businesses in the original city<U+2019>s site and help with the expense of moving to new buildings. His incentives gradually won over people, who moved their businesses to Polk Street in the new commercial district.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |author=Crawford, Jim |title=A town determined to survive  |date=July 23, 2006  |publisher=Amarillo Globe-News |url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/072306/spe_disama7.shtml |accessdate = 2007-01-27}}</ref> Heavy rains almost flooded Berry<U+2019>s part of the town in 1889, prompting more people to move to Sanborn's location. This eventually led to another county seat election making Sanborn's town the new county seat in 1893.<ref name="handbook" />

By the late 1890s, Amarillo had emerged as one of the world's busiest cattle shipping points, and its population grew significantly. The city became an elevator, milling, and feed-manufacturing center after an increase in production of wheat and small grains during the early 1900s. Discovery of [[natural gas|gas]] in 1918 and [[Petroleum|oil]] three years later brought oil and gas companies to the Amarillo area.<ref name="handbook" /> The United States government bought the Cliffside Gas Field with high helium content in 1927 and the Federal Bureau of Mines began operating the Amarillo Helium Plant two years later.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |author=Livadas,Greg |title=State of Ballooning: Texas |date=October 1999 |publisher=Balloon Life Magazine |url=http://balloonlife.com/publications/balloon_life/9801/9910/sob9910.html|accessdate = 2006-01-25}}</ref> The plant would be the sole producer of commercial helium in the world for a number of years.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas|id=HH/doh2|name=Helium Production}}.

Following the lead of the Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad, the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] and [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad]] established services to and from Amarillo. Each of these three carriers maintained substantial freight and passenger depots and repair facilities in the city through most of the 20th century and were major employers within the community.<ref name="railroads">{{cite news |first= |last= |author=Welch, Kevin |title=Crossroads of America |date=July 23, 2006 |publisher=[[Amarillo Globe-News]] |url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/072306/spe_disama2.shtml|accessdate = 2007-01-25 }}</ref> 

During the 1930s, the city was hit by the [[Dust Bowl]] and entered an [[Great Depression|economic depression]]. The [[U.S. Routes]] 60, 87, 287, and 66 merged at Amarillo, making it a major tourist stop with numerous motels, restaurants, and [[curio]] shops. [[World War II]] led the establishment of Amarillo Army Air Field in east Amarillo and the nearby Pantex Army Ordnance Plant, which produced bombs and ammunition. After the end of the war, both of the facilities were closed. The Pantex Plant was reopened in 1950 and produced nuclear weapons throughout the [[Cold War]].<ref name="handbook" /> The following year, the army air base was reactivated as [[Amarillo Air Force Base]] and expanded to accommodate a [[Strategic Air Command]] [[B-52 Stratofortress]] wing.<ref>{{cite web | author = Amarillo Economic Development Corporation | url = http://www.amarilloedc.com/index.php?id=51 | title = Community History | accessdate = 2006-01-28}}</ref> The arrival of servicemen and their families ended the city's depression. Between 1950 and 1960, Amarillo's population grew from 74,443 to 137,969. However, the closure of the Amarillo Air Force Base on [[December 31]], [[1968]], contributed to a decrease in population to 127,010 by 1970. In the 1970s, [[ASARCO]], [[Iowa Beef Processors]], [[Owens-Corning]] and [[Weyerhaeuser]] built plants at Amarillo. The Eastridge neighborhood houses immigrants from countries such as [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], and [[Burma]]. Many of them found employment at the nearby Iowa Beef Processors plant.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |author=Beck, Bruce |title=Representing all walks of life |date=December 27, 2006 |publisher=Amarillo Globe-News|url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/122706/our_6355729.shtml |accessdate = 2007-01-26}}</ref> The following decade, Amarillo's city limits encompassed 60 square miles in Potter and Randall counties. The [[Interstate 27]] highway connecting [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]] to Amarillo was built mostly during the 1980s.<ref name="handbook" />

Amarillo is located near the middle of the Texas Panhandle and is part of the [[Llano Estacado]] or Staked Plains region which has a surface that is relatively flat and has little drainage in the soil. Due to the lack of developed drainage, much of the rainfall either evaporates, infiltrates into the ground, or accumulates in [[playa lake]]s.<ref>Rathjen, Fredrick W. ''The Texas Panhandle Frontier'' (1973). pg. 11. The University of Texas Press.
