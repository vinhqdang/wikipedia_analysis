'''Physical chemistry''' is the study of macroscopic, atomic, subatomic, and particulate phenomena in chemical systems in terms of laws and concepts of [[physics]].  It applies the principles, practices and concepts of [[physics]] such as [[Motion (physics)|motion]], [[energy]], [[force]], [[time]], [[thermodynamics]], [[quantum chemistry]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]], [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]].

Physical chemistry, in contrast to [[chemical physics]], is predominantly (but not always) a macroscopic or supra-molecular science, as the majority of the principles on which physical chemistry was founded are concepts related to the bulk rather than on molecular/atomic structure alone. For example, [[chemical equilibrium]], and [[colloids]]. 

Some of the relationships that physical chemistry strives to resolve include the effects of:
#[[Intermolecular forces]] that act upon the physical properties of materials ([[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]], [[tensile strength]], [[surface tension]] in [[liquid]]s).
#[[Chemical kinetics|Reaction kinetics]] on the [[Reaction rate|rate of a reaction]].
#The identity of ions and the electrical conductivity of materials.
#[[Surface chemistry]] and [[electrochemistry]] of [[cell membrane|membranes]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=v1oU13xAl6AC&pg=RA1-PA134|page=134|title=Surface chemistry and electrochemistry of membranes|author=Torben Smith S<U+00F8>rensen|publisher=CRC Press|year=1999|isbn=0-8247-1922-0}}</ref>
#Interaction of one body with another in terms of quantities of [[heat]] and [[work (physics)|work]] called [[thermodynamics]].
#Transfer of heat between a chemical system and its surroundings during change of [[phase (matter)|phase]] or [[chemical reaction]] taking place called [[thermochemistry]]
#Study of [[colligative properties]] of number of species present in solution.
#Number of phases, number of components and degree of freedom (or variance) can be correlated with one another with help of [[phase rule]].
#Reactions of [[electrochemical cells]].

== Key concepts ==

The key concepts of physical chemistry are the ways in which pure physics is applied to chemical problems.

One of the key concepts in classical chemistry is that all [[chemical species|chemical compounds]] can be described as groups of [[atoms]] [[chemical bond|bonded]] together and [[chemical reactions]] can be described as the making and breaking of those bonds. Predicting the properties of chemical compounds from a description of atoms and how they bond is one of the major goals of physical chemistry. To describe the atoms and bonds precisely, it is necessary to know both where the [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of the atoms are, and how electrons are distributed around them.<ref name=Atkins249>Atkins, Peter and Friedman, Ronald (2005). ''Molecular Quantum Mechanics'', p. 249. Oxford University Press, New York. ISBN 0-19-927498-3.</ref><br>
[[Quantum chemistry]], a subfield of physical chemistry especially concerned with the application of [[quantum mechanics]] to chemical problems, provides tools to determine how strong and what shape bonds are,<ref name=Atkins249 /> how nuclei move, and how light can be absorbed or emitted by a chemical compound.<ref>Atkins, Peter and Friedman, Ronald (2005). ''Molecular Quantum Mechanics'', p. 342. Oxford University Press, New York. ISBN 0-19-927498-3.</ref> [[Spectroscopy]] is the related sub-discipline of physical chemistry which is specifically concerned with the interaction of [[electromagnetic radiation]] with matter.

Another set of important questions in chemistry concerns what kind of reactions can happen spontaneously and which properties are possible for a given chemical mixture. This is studied in [[chemical thermodynamics]], which sets limits on quantities like how far a reaction can proceed, or how much energy can be converted into work in an [[internal combustion engine]], and which provides links between properties like the [[thermal expansion coefficient]] and rate of change of [[entropy]] with [[pressure]] for a [[gas]] or a [[liquid]].<ref>Landau, L. D. and Lifshitz, E. M. (1980). ''Statistical Physics'', 3rd Ed. p. 52. Elsevier Butterworth Heinemann, New York. ISBN 0-7506-3372-7.</ref> It can frequently be used to assess whether a reactor or engine design is feasible, or to check the validity of experimental data. To a limited extent, [[quasi-equilibrium]] and [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]] can describe irreversible changes.<ref name=Hill1>Hill, Terrell L. (1986). ''Introduction to Statistical Thermodynamics'', p. 1. Dover Publications, New York. ISBN 0-486-65242-4.</ref> However, classical thermodynamics is mostly concerned with systems in [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] and [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible changes]] and not what actually does happen, or how fast, away from equilibrium.

Which reactions do occur and how fast is the subject of [[chemical kinetics]], another branch of physical chemistry. A key idea in chemical kinetics is that for [[reagent|reactants]] to react and form [[Product (chemistry)|products]], most chemical species must go through [[transition state]]s which are higher in [[Thermodynamic free energy|energy]] than either the reactants or the products and serve as a barrier to reaction.<ref>Schmidt, Lanny D. (2005). ''The Engineering of Chemical Reactions'', 2nd Ed. p. 30. Oxford University Press, New York. ISBN 0-19-516925-5.</ref> In general, the higher the barrier, the slower the reaction. A second is that most chemical reactions occur as a sequence of [[elementary reaction]]s,<ref>Schmidt, Lanny D. (2005). ''The Engineering of Chemical Reactions'', 2nd Ed. p. 25, 32. Oxford University Press, New York. ISBN 0-19-516925-5.</ref> each with its own transition state. Key questions in kinetics include how the rate of reaction depends on temperature and on the concentrations of reactants and [[catalysts]] in the reaction mixture, as well as how catalysts and reaction conditions can be engineered to optimize the reaction rate.

The fact that how fast reactions occur can often be specified with just a few concentrations and a temperature, instead of needing to know all the positions and speeds of every molecule in a mixture, is a special case of another key concept in physical chemistry, which is that to the extent an engineer needs to know, everything going on in a mixture of very large numbers (perhaps of the order of the [[Avogadro constant]], 6 x 10<sup>23</sup>) of particles can often be described by just a few variables like pressure, temperature, and concentration. The precise reasons for this are described in [[statistical mechanics]],<ref name=Chandler>Chandler, David (1987). ''Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics'', p. 54. Oxford University Press, New York. ISBN 978-0-19-504277-1.</ref> a specialty within physical chemistry which is also shared with physics. Statistical mechanics also provides ways to predict the properties we see in everyday life from molecular properties without relying on empirical correlations based on chemical similarities.<ref name=Hill1 />

[[File:Lomonosov Chymiae Physicae 1752.jpg|thumb|right|Fragment of M. Lomonosov's manuscript 'Physical Chemistry' (1752)]]
The term "physical chemistry" was coined by [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] in 1752, when he presented a lecture course entitled "A Course in True Physical Chemistry" (Russian: <U+00AB><U+041A><U+0443><U+0440><U+0441> <U+0438><U+0441><U+0442><U+0438><U+043D><U+043D><U+043E><U+0439> <U+0444><U+0438><U+0437><U+0438><U+0447><U+0435><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0439> <U+0445><U+0438><U+043C><U+0438><U+0438><U+00BB>) before the students of [[Petersburg University]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YoE1wsA6USQC&pg=PA388|page=388|title=Science in Russian culture|author=Alexander Vucinich|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1963|isbn=0-8047-0738-3}}</ref> In the preamble to these lectures he gives definition: "Physical chemistry is the science that must explain under provisions of physical experiments the reason for what is happening in complex bodies through chemical operations".

Modern physical chemistry originated in the 1860s to 1880s with work on [[chemical thermodynamics]], [[electrolyte]]s in solutions, [[chemical kinetics]] and other subjects. One milestone was the publication in 1876 by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] of his paper, ''[[On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances]]''.  This paper introduced several of the cornerstones of physical chemistry, such as [[Gibbs free energy|Gibbs energy]], [[chemical potential]]s, [[Gibbs phase rule]].<ref>Josiah Willard Gibbs, 1876, "[[On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances]]", ''Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Sciences''</ref> Other milestones include the subsequent naming and accreditation of [[enthalpy]] to [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] and to [[macromolecular]] processes. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The first [[scientific journal]] specifically in the field of physical chemistry was the German journal, ''[[Zeitschrift f<U+00FC>r Physikalische Chemie]]'', founded in 1887 by [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] and [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]]. Together with [[Svante August Arrhenius]],<ref>{{Cite book|last = Laidler|first = Keith|authorlink = Keith J. Laidler
| title = The World of Physical Chemistry|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1993| location = Oxford|pages = 48|isbn = 0-19-855919-4}}</ref>  these were the leading figures in physical chemistry in the late 19th century and early 20th century. All three were awarded with the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] between 1901-1909.

Developments in the following decades include the application of [[statistical mechanics]] to chemical systems and work on [[colloid]]s and [[surface chemistry]], where [[Irving Langmuir]] made many contributions. Another important step was the development of [[quantum mechanics]] into [[quantum chemistry]] from the 1930s, where [[Linus Pauling]] was one of the leading names. Theoretical developments have gone hand in hand with developments in experimental methods, where the use of different forms of [[spectroscopy]], such as [[infrared spectroscopy]], [[microwave spectroscopy]], [[EPR spectroscopy]] and [[NMR spectroscopy]], is probably the most important 20th century development.

Further development in physical chemistry may be attributed to discoveries in [[nuclear chemistry]], especially in isotope separation (before and during World War II), more recent discoveries in [[astrochemistry]],<ref>{{cite journal|author = Herbst, Eric|title = Chemistry of Star-Forming Regions|journal = Journal of Physical Chemistry A|date = May 12, 2005|volume = 109|number = 18|pages = 4017<U+2013>4029 | doi = 10.1021/jp050461c|pmid=16833724}}</ref> as well as the development of calculation algorithms in the field of "additive physicochemical properties" (practically all physicochemical properties, such as boiling point, critical point, surface tension, vapor pressure, etc. - more than 20 in all - can be precisely calculated from chemical structure alone, even if the chemical molecule remains unsynthesized),{{fact|date=February 2013}} and in this area is concentrated practical importance of contemporary physical chemistry.
