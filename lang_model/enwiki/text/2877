'''Master Chief Petty Officer John-117''', commonly called '''Master Chief''', is the fictional protagonist of the [[Halo universe|''Halo'' universe]], created by [[Bungie Studios]], and is a [[player character]] in the trilogy of science fiction [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]]s ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'',  ''[[Halo 2]]'', and ''[[Halo 3]]''. Outside of video games, the Master Chief appears in the novels ''[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]'', ''[[Halo: The Flood]]'', ''[[Halo: First Strike]]'', and ''[[Halo: Uprising]]'', and has cameos in ''[[Halo: Ghosts of Onyx]]'' and the ''[[Halo Graphic Novel]]''. He is voiced by [[Steve Downes]] in the video games in which he appears.

The Master Chief is one of the most visible symbols of the [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' series]]. Originally designed by Marcus Lehto, Rob McLees, and Shi Kai Wang, the character is a towering and faceless [[cybernetics|cybernetically]] enhanced supersoldier; he is never seen without his armor or helmet. The character has been called an icon, a relative newcomer among more established franchise characters, such as [[Mario]], [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], and [[Lara Croft]].<ref name="businessweek">{{cite web|author=Snow, Black|date=[[2007-08-03]]|url=http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/aug2007/id2007083_351181.htm|title=Game Icons We Love|work=businessweek.com|accessdate=2007-10-08|quote=Microsoft's Master Chief, perhaps the newest franchise character on the block, is no different.}}</ref> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' named the Master Chief as the eighth greatest video game character ever. Conversely, the Chief's silent nature during gameplay has led to criticisms that the character is one-dimensional and unbelievable. 

==Character design==
[[Image:Masterchief sheik.png|thumb|right|upright|Shi Kai Wang's sketch which became the basis for the Master Chief]]
The task of developing the Master Chief for the character's first appearance in ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' fell on Rob McLees and the project's Art Director, Marcus Lehto. Eventually, Shi Kai Wang was hired for conceptual art.<ref name=aoh20>{{cite book |last= Trautmann|first=Eric|title=The Art of Halo|year= 2004|publisher= Del Ray Publishing|location=New York |isbn=0-345-47586-0 |pages=20}}</ref> One of Wang's sketches was accepted and became the basis for the Master Chief. However, after Wang's version was converted to a 3-D model, it was decided the Master Chief looked too slender, "almost effeminate".<ref name=aoh20 /> The Master Chief was subsequently bulked up to the version currently found in the games.<ref name=aoh20 /> Similarly, the Chief's armor went through various changes, such as adding an antenna, which was removed later in development, and a green tint.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=prexboxhistory040904 |title=One Million Years B.X. |author=Bungie|date=[[2006-02-10]] |work=bungie.net|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060210224125/http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=prexboxhistory040904 |archivedate=2006-02-10 }}</ref>

In an interview on creating believable video game characters, Bungie's [[Joseph Staten]] noted that, until the Master Chief was created, Bungie had not considered how to immerse people in the world of ''Halo''. "Master Chief is really what kicked off the creativity," he said, "in terms of how people react to him. He's a space marine in really cool green armor."<ref>{{cite web|author=Cifaldi, Frank|date=[[2005-05-26]]|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20050526/cifaldi_01.shtml|title=E3 Report: Developing Better Characters, Better Stories|work=gamasutra.com|accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref>

Steve Downes, who voices the Master Chief, is a disc jockey and voice actor who had never played video games before ''Halo''.<ref name=interview1/> [[Martin O'Donnell]], Bungie's music director, had worked with Downes on a previous video game, ''[[Septerra Core: Legacy of the Creator]]'', and recommended him for the part.<ref>{{cite web|author=KLind|date=[[2006-07-26]]|url=http://buttonbasher.wordpress.com/2006/07/27/interview-master-chief-steve-downes/|title=Interview with the Master Chief|work=buttonbasher.com|accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref> Downes has never appeared at Bungie or Microsoft events, and believes that the Master Chief is left masked because "[the character's identity] is really in the eye of the player".<ref name=interview2>Downes, Steven.

===Personality===
Steve Downes said that his voice acting was based entirely on Bungie's written character description provided , which specified a character similar to [[Clint Eastwood]] and of few words. In a [[podcast]] interview, the actor noted that, during the recording, he was given a fair amount of creative leeway to develop the Chief's personality.<ref name=interview1>Downes, Steven. [http://www.davidjamesdague.com/MC_Part1.mp3 Interview with "Xerxdeej"], ''tiedtheleader.com''. (2005-08-23).</ref> In the games, the Master Chief never speaks during player-controlled gameplay, making him almost a [[silent protagonist]]. Even during cutscenes, the character generally speaks sparingly. Bungie Studios' Frank O'Connor has described the Chief as "so quiet and so invisible, literally, that the player gets to pretend they're the Chief. The player gets to inhabit those shoes [and] apply their own personality."<ref name=frank>{{cite web |url = http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/articles/813/813227p2.html |title = IGN interview with Frankie O'connor |accessdate = 2007-09-02 |author = Kolan, Patrick |date = [[2006-09-02]]|work = ign.com }}</ref>  Bungie concept artist Eddie Smith described the Master Chief as "pretty much the consummate professional.

Entirely encased in heavy armor and standing seven feet tall, the Chief inspires awe and terror in friends and foes alike.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=15}}</ref> Despite his cold exterior, Master Chief cares about his fellow soldiers, especially the Spartan-IIs with whom he has trained.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0|pages=18}}</ref> At one point, the Master Chief risks injury in a massive explosion to save a fellow Spartan,<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: First Strike]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-46781-7 |pages=324}}</ref> and withholds combat information on the threat of the [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]], an alien parasite, after realizing that its disclosure would mean the death of [[Sergeant Major A.J.

Despite the Master Chief's excellent combat record, many in the [[United Nations Space Command]] (UNSC), the military unit to which he belongs, distrust him. [[Characters in the Halo series#Antonio Silva|Antonio Silva]], an [[United Nations Space Command#Orbital Drop Shock Troopers|Orbital Drop Shock Trooper]], exemplifies this attitude,<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: First Strike]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-46781-7 |pages=54}}</ref> and considers the Master Chief a freak product of an experiment that should never be repeated.<ref name=tf81>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=81}}</ref> While the Chief resents Silva's dishonor to his fallen comrades' memory, he is also loyal to the chain of command, and remains quiet.<ref name=tf81/> Despite these explorations of the character's personality, O'Connor said in an interview that revealing the face of the Chief is not as important as revealing the events going on around the character.<ref name=frank/>

===Outward appearance===
In the video games, the Master Chief is never seen without his armor. In the last cutscene of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', the Chief removes his helmet, but camera movement hides his face; Bungie Studios did this intentionally to allow the player to better become the Master Chief.<ref name=time/> The only physical description of the Master Chief comes from the novels. During a briefing in ''[[Halo: The Flood]]'', the Chief is described as tall with short hair, serious eyes, and strong features.<ref name=tf80 /> His skin is "too white", testifying to the amount of time he spends in his armor.<ref name=tf80>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=80}}</ref> With his armor, the Master Chief stands about seven&nbsp;feet (2.13&nbsp;m) tall and weighs one thousand pounds (450&nbsp;kg);<ref>{{cite book | year=2004 | editor=Bungie | title=''Halo 2'' Instruction Manual | pages=8 | publisher=Microsoft Game Studios|language=English}}</ref> without it, the Chief still stands six&nbsp;feet, six&nbsp;inches (1.98&nbsp;m) tall and weighs 287&nbsp;pounds (130&nbsp;kg).<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]|year= 2001|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45132-5 |pages=205}}</ref>

The Master Chief's backstory is never explained in the video games. A prequel of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', the 2001 novel ''[[Halo: The Fall of Reach|The Fall of Reach]]'', reveals much of the character's history and was released as a companion to the game. The Master Chief, originally named John, was born in 2511 and first lived with his family on the human colony planet Eridanus 2. Large for his six years of age, and approximately a foot above his school peers, he is described as a typical boy with brown hair, freckles and a gap between his two front teeth.<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]|year= 2001|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45132-5 |pages=24}}</ref> In 2517, John and seventy-four other children his age are covertly taken from their homes and replaced with [[United Nations Space Command#Flash clones|flash clones]] to hide the kidnapping.

[[Image:Masterchief-and-company.png|thumb|right|The Master Chief (left), [[Cortana]], and [[Characters in the Halo series#Jacob Keyes|Captain Keyes]] aboard the ''Pillar of Autumn'']]
The Master Chief first appears in the games as the [[protagonist]] of ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. In ''Halo: The Flood'', the 2003 novelization of the video game, the Chief is likewise the main character. During the opening cinematic of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', the Chief is awakened from cryonic sleep. On exiting of [[slipspace]], the ''[[Pillar of Autumn]]'' is attacked by the Covenant and crash lands on [[Halo (megastructure)|Halo]], a ring-shaped megastructure. Master Chief escapes the ship via lifeboat. Upon landing on Halo, his first task is to find other survivors. While fighting the Covenant, the Master Chief and Cortana learn that Halo was created by an ancient race, the [[Forerunner (Halo)|Forerunners]], as a last line of defense against an alien parasite called the [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]].<ref name=bigblow/> The Covenant accidentally releases the Flood, which begins to spread across the ring.<ref>'''343 Guilty Spark''': Greetings.

''[[Halo: First Strike]]'', the 2003 novel by [[Eric Nylund]], follows the Master Chief after the events of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' and serves as a bridge between the events of ''Halo'' and ''Halo 2''.

The Chief retrieves [[Characters in the Halo series#Catherine Halsey|Dr. Catherine Halsey]], the creative genius behind the [[SPARTAN-II Project]], and his fellow soldiers.

===''Halo: Uprising'' and ''Halo 3''===
{{see also|Halo: Uprising|Halo 3}}
The Master Chief appears as a main character in Marvel's [[limited series]] ''[[Halo: Uprising]]'', in which he breaks into a Covenant-held Forerunner structure before being captured by the Covenant.<ref>{{cite book |last= Bendis|first= Brian Michael|title=[[Halo: Uprising]], Book 1|year= 2007|publisher= [[Marvel Comics]]|location=New York |pages=20}}</ref> Like ''First Strike'', the comic serves as a bridge between two video games, ''Halo 2'' and ''Halo 3'', in which Master Chief is again the main character.

Back on Earth, the Master Chief helps to repel hostile Covenant forces from [[Mombasa]], [[Kenya]] and [[Voi]]. With the [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]] (a [[Covenant Elite]] who has sided with humanity) and fellow allies, the Chief leads the assault on a [[Forerunner (Halo)|Forerunner]] artifact that the Covenant [[Hierarchs (Halo)#High Prophet of Truth|Prophet of Truth]] is attempting to activate.

The allied [[Covenant Elite|Elite]]s and humans decide to activate the ''new'' Halo in order to kill the Flood outside the galaxy, and thus preserve life there. 343 Guilty Spark opposes the premature activation of the incomplete installation and attempts to stop it. The Master Chief destroys him, activates the ring, and escapes with Cortana and the Arbiter on the UNSC frigate ''Forward Unto Dawn''. During the escape, the collapsing slipspace portal severs the ''Dawn'' in two, stranding Cortana and the Master Chief deep in space. While the Arbiter returns to Earth, Cortana activates a distress beacon, knowing that rescue could take years; the Master Chief enters cryonic sleep, telling Cortana, "Wake me when you need me."<ref>{{cite video game| title = [[Halo 3]]| developer = Bungie Studios| publisher = Microsoft| date = 2007| platform =[[Xbox 360]]| version = | level = Halo| language = English}}</ref>

==Appearances in other media==

Roger Travis, associate professor of classics at the [[University of Connecticut]], compared the Master Chief to the epic hero [[Aeneas]], in that both superhuman characters save a civilization by defeating strong enemies in a martial setting. The audience is intended to become immersed and to identify with the protagonist similarly in both stories.<ref name="Travis">{{cite web|last=Travis|first=Roger|date=[[October 10]], [[2006]]|title=Bungie's Epic Achievement: Halo and the Aeneid|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_66/384-Bungie-s-Epic-Achievement|work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref> [[IGN]] saw in the Master Chief elements of Jon 6725416, a character in [[Christopher Rowley]]'s novel ''Starhammer''.<ref name="Perry">{{cite web|last=Perry|first=Douglass|date=[[May 17]], [[2006]]|url=http://xbox.ign.com/articles/709/709122p1.html|title=The Influence of Literature and Myth in Videogames|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc|page=5|accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref> Reviewers have suggested that the name John-117 could be a Biblical reference.<ref name="Perry" /><ref name="gcreview" />

Reaction to the Master Chief as a character is generally mixed.
