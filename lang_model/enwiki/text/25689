The '''Eastern''' or '''American Goldfinch''' (''Carduelis tristis''), also known as the '''Wild Canary''', is a [[North America]]n [[bird]] in the [[finch]] [[family (biology)|family]]. It is [[bird migration|migratory]], ranging from southern [[Canada]] to [[North Carolina]] during the breeding season, and from just south of the Canadian border to [[Mexico]] during the winter.

The only finch in its [[subfamily]] which undergoes a complete [[molt]], the American Goldfinch displays [[sexual dimorphism]] in its coloration; the male is a vibrant yellow in the summer and an olive color during the winter months, while the female is a dull yellow-brown shade which brightens only slightly during the summer. The male displays brightly colored [[plumage]] during the breeding season to attract a mate.

The American Goldfinch is [[granivorous]] and [[adaptation|adapted]] for the consumption of [[seedhead]]s, with a conical [[beak]] to remove the seeds and agile feet to grip the stems of seedheads while feeding. It is a social bird, and will gather in large flocks while feeding and migrating. It may behave [[Territory (animal)|territorially]] during nest construction, but this aggression is short-lived. Its breeding season is tied to the peak of food supply, beginning in late July, which is relatively late in the year for a finch. This species is generally [[monogamous]], and produces one brood each year.

Human activity has generally benefited the American Goldfinch. It is often found in residential areas, attracted to [[bird feeders]] installed by humans, which increases its survival rate in these areas. [[Deforestation]] by humans also creates open meadow areas which are the preferred [[habitat]] of the American Goldfinch.

== Taxonomy ==
The American Goldfinch was one of the many species originally described by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his 18th century work, ''[[Systema Naturae]]''.<ref>{{la icon}} {{cite book  | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus  | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

Its closest relatives are the [[Lesser Goldfinch]] ''(C. psaltria)'', [[Lawrence's Goldfinch]] ''(C. lawrencei)'', and the [[siskin]]s. Though it shares a name with the [[European Goldfinch]], the two are in separate subgenera and are not directly related.<ref name="Zip code">{{cite web|url=http://zipcodezoo.com/Animals/C/Carduelis_tristis.asp|author=BayScience Foundation|title=''Carduelis tristis''(American Goldfinch)|accessmonthday=[[24 May]]|accessyear=2007}}</ref> 
''Carduelis'' is derived from ''carduus'', the [[Latin]] word for [[thistle]], while the species name, ''tristis'', is Latin for 'sorrowful.'<ref name="Notre Dame">{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/words.exe?tristis|author=Whitaker, William|title=Words by William Whitaker|accessmonthday=[[24 May]]|accessyear=2007}}</ref>

There are four recognized [[subspecies]] of the American Goldfinch:<ref name="ITIS"/>

*'''''C. t. tristis''''' is the most common of the subspecies. Its summer range is from southern Canada to [[Colorado]], and east to the [[Carolinas]]. Its winter range is from southern Canada south to [[Florida]] and central Mexico.<ref name="BNA">{{cite web|url=http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/BNA/Login.do|author=Middleton, A. L. A. |title=American Goldfinch ''Carduelis tristis''|accessmonthday=[[25 May]]|accessyear=2007}}</ref>

*'''''C. t. pallidus''''' is differentiated from other subspecies by its paler body color, stronger white markings and, in males, a larger black cap. It is slightly larger than ''C. t. tristis''. The summer range is from [[British Columbia]] to western [[Ontario]], south to [[Colorado]] and west to [[Oregon]]. In winter, the range extends from southern Canada and northern [[California]], south to Mexico.<ref name="BNA"/>

*'''''C. t. jewetti''''' is smaller and darker than the other subspecies. It occurs on the coastal slope of the [[Cascade Range|Cascade Mountains]] from southern British Columbia to central California, overlapping with the range of ''C. t. pallidus''.<ref name="BNA"/>

*'''''C. t. salicamans''''' occurs west of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] range during the summer and in south and central [[Baja California]] to the [[Mohave Desert|Mohave]] and [[Colorado Desert]]s in winter. In winter, the plumage of both sexes is browner than other subspecies, and in summer, the male's black cap is smaller than that of other subspecies.<ref name="BNA"/>

== Description ==
[[Image:American goldfinch winter f.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Female American Goldfinch in winter plumage.]]
The American Goldfinch is a small finch, 11<U+2013>13&nbsp;centimeters (4<U+2013>5&nbsp;in) in length, with a [[wingspan]] of 19<U+2013>22&nbsp;centimeters (7<U+2013>9&nbsp;in). It weighs between 11<U+2013>20&nbsp;grams (0.39<U+2013>0.71&nbsp;oz).<ref name="Georgia Wildlife Guide"> {{cite web|url=http://museum.nhm.uga.edu/gawildlife/birds/passeriformes/ctristis.html|publisher=The Georgia Museum of Natural History and Georgia Department of Natural Resources|title=''Carduelis tristis''|accessmonthday=[[6 May]]|accessyear=2007}}</ref> The beak is small, conical, and pink for most of the year, though it turns bright orange with the spring molt in both sexes.<ref name="Cornell Bird Guide"/>
The shape and size of the beak are a result of adaptation, to aid in the extraction of [[seed]]s from the seed heads of [[thistle]]s, [[sunflower]]s, and the other plants which make up its [[diet (nutrition)|diet]].<ref name="Birds of the Hinterlands"/> 

The American Goldfinch undergoes a molt in the spring and fall. The sexual dimorphism displayed in plumage coloration is especially pronounced after the spring molt, when the bright color of the male's summer plumage is needed to attract a mate.<ref name="Birds of the Hinterlands"/>  It is the only cardueline finch to undergo a complete molt; other finches change plumage color by the gradual wearing-down of the [[feather]]s.<ref name="Chipper Woods Bird Observatory"/> In each molt, it sheds all but the wing and tail feathers, which are dark olive in the female and black in the male. The markings on these feathers remain identical through each molt, with large white bars on the wings, and white feathers at the edges of the short, notched tail.<ref name="Cornell Bird Guide"/> 

Once the spring molt is completed, the body of the male is a brilliant lemon yellow, a color produced by [[carotenoid]] [[pigment]]s from plant materials in its diet,<ref>{{cite journal

The goldfinch becomes [[Buff (colour)|buff]] below and olive-brown above, with a pale yellow face and bib. The fall plumage is almost identical in both sexes; the only markings which differentiate the sexes are the yellow shoulder patches of the male.<ref name="San Diego Natural History Museum"/> In some winter ranges, the goldfinches lose all traces of yellow, becoming a predominantly medium tan-gray color with an olive tinge evident only on close viewing.

The immature American Goldfinch is colored differently from the adult during its first fall and winter. The back is dull brown, and the underside is pale yellow. The shoulders and tail are dull black with buff-colored, rather than white, markings on wings and rump. This coloration is the same in both genders.<ref name="San Diego Natural History Museum">{{cite web|url=http://www.sdnhm.org/research/birdatlas/focus/goldfinches.html|author=Unitt, P.; N.

The [[bird song|song]] of the American Goldfinch is a series of musical warbles and twitters, often with a long note. A ''tsee-tsi-tsi-tsit'' call is often given in flight; it may also be described as ''per-chic-o-ree''.<ref name="Cornell Bird Guide"/> While the female [[Avian incubation|incubate]]s the eggs, she calls her returning mate with a soft continuous ''teeteeteeteete'' sound. The young begin to use a call of ''chick-kee'' or ''chick-wee'' shortly before [[fledge|fledging]], which they use until they have left the nest entirely.<ref name="Birds of the Hinterlands"/> There are two defense calls made by adults during nesting; a ''sweeet'' call made to rally other goldfinches to the nest and distract [[predator]]s, and a ''bearbee'' used to signal to the nestlings to quiet them and get them to crouch down in the nest (to become less conspicuous).<ref>{{cite journal

==  Distribution and habitat==
The American Goldfinch prefers open country where weeds thrive, such as [[field (agriculture)|field]]s, meadows, [[flood plain]]s, as well as roadsides, [[orchards]], and gardens. It may also be found in open [[deciduous]] and [[Riparian zone|riparian]] woodlands and areas of [[Secondary forest|secondary growth]].<ref name="Terres">{{cite book| last =Terres| first =J. K.| authorlink =John Kenneth Terres| title =The Audubon Society Encyclopedia of North American Birds| publisher =Knopf| date =1980| location =New York, NY| pages = 329| doi =| id =ISBN 0394466519 }}</ref> This [[habitat]] preference continues during the spring and fall migrations.<ref name="Cornell Bird Guide"/> 

The summer [[breeding range]] stretches across North America from coast to coast. It is bounded on the north by [[Saskatchewan]] and stretches south across North America to [[North Carolina]] on the east coast, and northern [[California]] on the west coast.<ref name="Cornell Bird Guide">{{cite web|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/American_Goldfinch_dtl.html|publisher=Cornell Lab of Ornithology|title=American Goldfinch|accessmonthday=[[12 April]]|accessyear=2007}}</ref> The American Goldfinch is a short-distance migrant, moving south in response to colder weather and lessened food supply. The migration is completed in compact [[flock (birds)|flock]]s, which travel in an erratic, wavelike flight pattern.<ref name="Smithsonian"/>

Its winter range includes southern [[Canada]] and stretches south through the [[United States]] to parts of [[Mexico]]. In winter, in the northern part of its range, the finch may move nearer to [[bird feeder|feeders]] if they are available. In southern ranges, during winter, they remain in areas similar to the fields and flood plains where they live during the summer months.<ref name="University of Michigan: Animal Diversity">{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Carduelis_tristis.html|author=Roof, J.|title=Carduelis Tristis|accessmonthday=[[12 April]]|accessyear=2007}}</ref>

== Behavior==
[[Image:Goldfinch tgo.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Male at a thistle feeder.]]
The American Goldfinch is [[wikt:gregarious|gregarious]] during the non-breeding season, when it is often found in large flocks, usually with other finches. Flocks generally fly in an undulating pattern, creating a wave-shaped path.<ref name="University of Michigan: Animal Diversity"/>
During the breeding season, it lives in loose [[Colony (biology)|colonies]]. While the nest is being constructed, the male will act aggressively toward other males who intrude into his territory, driving them away, and the female reacts in the same way toward other females. This aggressiveness fades once the eggs have been laid.<ref name= Sullivan>{{cite book |author=Sullivan, J.|title=Hunting for Frogs on Elston, and Other Tales from Field & Street|url= http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0226779939&id=2ENJUxG5cQwC&pg=PA207&lpg=PA207&ots=B2Q_MY5MJj&dq=Carduelis+tristis&sig=LBv9vlWqKtOTjsmRRSoSUsXoLDc| publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year= |pages= |isbn=0-226-77993-9 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>

The American Goldfinch does not act aggressively toward predators within its territory; its only reaction is [[Alarm call|alarm calling]]. Predators include [[snakes]], [[weasel]]s, [[squirrels]], and [[Blue Jay]]s, which may destroy eggs or kill young, and [[hawks]] and [[cats]], which pose a threat to both young and adults. 
===Diet===
The American Goldfinch is a [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] feeder. It is mainly granivorous, but will occasionally eat insects which it feeds to its young in order to provide them with [[protein]].  Its [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] consists of the seeds from a wide variety of [[annual]] plants, often those of weeds grasses and trees, such as thistle, [[teasel]], [[dandelion]], [[ragweed]], [[mullein]], [[cosmos]], [[Salsify|goatsbeard]], [[sunflower]], and [[alder]].<ref name="Terres"/> However, it also consumes tree buds, maple sap, and berries. It will eat at bird feeders provided by humans, particularly in the winter months, preferring thistle seed.<ref name="hearth"/>

[[Image:Carduelis-tristis-001.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Male perched on a thistle plant.]]
Unlike some finch species, the American Goldfinch uses its feet extensively in feeding. It frequently hangs from seedheads while feeding in order to reach the seeds more easily. In the spring, the American Goldfinch feeds on the [[catkin]]s hanging from birches and alders by pulling one up with its beak and using its toes to hold the catkin still against the branch. This dexterity enables it to take advantage of food sources relatively inaccessible to potential competitors, increasing its chances of survival.<ref name="Birds of the Hinterlands">{{cite web|url=http://www.hww.ca/hww2.asp?id=24|author=Hayakawa, E.|title=American Goldfinch|accessmonthday=[[6 May]]|accessyear=2007}}</ref>

=== Reproduction ===
[[Image:American Goldfinch-27527.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Male (left) and female (right) at a thistle feeder.]]
The American Goldfinch begins its breeding season later in the year than any other finch.<ref name="Birds of the Hinterlands"/> This may be related to the abundance of seeds in the late summer months, as seeds represent the majority of their diet.<ref name= Sullivan/>

The courtship rituals of the American Goldfinch include aerial maneuvers and singing by males, who begin courtship in late July. The flight displays begin as the male pursues the female, who flies in zigzagging evasive patterns. The male is able to signal his quality and fitness, both in the short term (current body condition) and long term (genes), through ornamentation (bill color and plumage).<ref>{{cite journal

  | pages =1008-1019
  | year =2006}}</ref> If a female accepts the male as a mate, the pair will fly in wide circles, as the male warbles throughout the flight.<ref name="Birds of the Hinterlands"/>

Once a male has found a mate, he selects a territory, marking the boundaries by warbling as he flies from perch to perch. After circling the perimeter, he performs two flight displays, first repeating a low, flat flight, then flying in an exaggerated version of normal flight, tucking his wings close to his body, plummeting earthwards and catching himself as he spreads his wings to glide upward in a series of loops. Two or three pairs may group their territories together in a loose colony, perhaps to aid in defense against predators.<ref name="Birds of the Hinterlands"/>

[[Image:Aug 5 2006 goldfinchnest.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Nest of an American Goldfinch]]The nest is built in late summer by the female in the branches of a [[deciduous]] shrub or tree at a height of up to 10&nbsp;meters (30&nbsp;ft). The nest-building lasts approximately six days, during which time the females works in 10<U+2013>40&nbsp;minute increments. The male frequently flies with the female as she collects nesting materials, and though he may carry some materials back to the nest, he leaves its construction to the female. The outer shell of the nest is built of bark, weeds, vines, and grass.<ref name="Smithsonian">{{cite web|url=http://www.birdsbybent.com/ch41-50/goldfinch.html|author=Bent, A. C. |title=Carduelis tristis [Eastern American Goldfinch]|accessmonthday=[[13 April]]|accessyear=2007}}</ref> The inside diameter of the finished nest is about 6.5&nbsp;centimeters (2.5&nbsp;in).<ref name="Terres"/> The rim is reinforced with bark bound by [[Spider web|spiderweb]]s and caterpillar silk, and the cup is lined with plant down from milkweed, thistle, or cattail. The nest is so tightly woven that it can hold water, and it is possible for nestlings to drown following a rainstorm if the parents do not cover the nest.<ref name="Chipper Woods Bird Observatory"/>

American Goldfinches lay four to six bluish-white to greenish-blue [[egg (biology)|egg]]s, which are oval in shape and about 16&nbsp;x&nbsp;12&nbsp;millimeters (.6&nbsp;x&nbsp;.45&nbsp;in), roughly the size of a [[peanut]].<ref name="Smithsonian"/> It is thought that they are laid during the night.<ref name="University of Michigan: Animal Diversity"/> The eggs are incubated by the female alone, though the male brings her food as she nests, and most mating pairs raise only one brood each year.<ref name="Smithsonian"/> 
 
The chicks hatch 12<U+2013>14&nbsp;days after incubation begins. Like all [[passerine]]s, the chicks are [[altricial]]; they are born naked, with reddish bodies, pale grey [[down feather|down]], and closed eyes.<ref name="Stanford">{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/Precocial_and_Altricial.html| author= Ehrlich, P.R.; D.S. Dobkin; D. Wheye|title=Precocial and Atricial|accessmonthday=[[6 May]]|accessyear=2007}}</ref> The mother bird feeds her young [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitated]] seeds and insects as they grow.<ref name="DNR"/> The hatchings develop quickly, opening their eyes after three days, and completing the growth of olive-brown juvenile plumage after 11<U+2013>15&nbsp;days, at which time they begin to practice short flights close to the nest. For up to three weeks after fledging, they are still fed by the male, who locates them by listening for their fledging call. The chicks stop giving this call when they become entirely independent.<ref name="Birds of the Hinterlands"/>

American Goldfinches are occasionally victims of brood parasites, particularly [[Brown-headed Cowbird]]s. One study found that 9% of nests had Brown-headed Cowbird eggs in them.<ref>{{Citation

This is despite the fact that the American Goldfinch has no known behavioral adaptations against brood parasites. It is thought that the inability of Brown-headed Cowbird chicks to survive is due to a failure to get enough [[nutrition]]; the seed-rich diet of American Goldfinch chicks varies from the usual insect-rich diet of other hosts.<ref>{{Citation

== Relationship with humans ==
The American Goldfinch is found in residential areas throughout its range. Backyard [[Birdwatching|birders]] attract it using feeders containing Nyjer thistle seed,<ref name="hearth"/> or by planting grasses and [[perennial plant]]s, such as [[zinnias]], [[cosmos (plant)|cosmos]], [[bee balm]], or [[globe thistle]], which produce seedheads favored by finches. Although some controversy surrounds [[bird feeding]] (see [[bird feeder]] for details), an increase in backyard feeding by humans has generally been beneficial to this species.<ref name="hearth"> {{cite web | title = Backyard Birdwatching | author= Elece Hollis | publisher = Garden and Hearth |url = http://www.gardenandhearth.com/Bird-Watching/American-Goldfinch.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-25}}</ref> 

The American Goldfinch is not threatened by human activity, and is widespread throughout its range.<ref name="ITIS">{{cite web|url=http://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=179236|author=ITIS Report|title=ITIS Standard Report: ''Carduelis tristis''|accessmonthday=[[6 May]]|accessyear=2007}}</ref><ref name="iucn">{{IUCN2006|assessors=BirdLife International|year=2004|id=53442|title=Carduelis tristis|downloaded=12 May 2006}}</ref> The clearing of forests by humans, though harmful to many species, has benefited the American Goldfinch.
