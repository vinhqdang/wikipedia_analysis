:''The history of the [[Netherlands]] is closely related to that of the [[Low Countries]]; it was not until the 16th century that an independent state roughly corresponding to the present-day country was established. As a consequence, the geographical scope of this article sometimes extends to the southern parts of the Low Countries. Conversely, a  large part of what is now the Netherlands was sea or swamp well into the Middle Ages.''

If one took the oldest signs of human activity as a starting point for the '''history of the Netherlands''', then such a history would span at least two hundred fifty thousand years. It was, however, not until the arrival of the [[ancient Rome|Romans]], who annexed the southern part of the present-day country, that written sources on its inhabitants became abundant.

The southern part of the current country was occupied by the Romans, and became part of [[Gallia Belgica]], and later of the [[Roman province]] [[Germania Inferior]]. In this time the country was inhabited by various [[Germanic tribes]], and the south was inhabited by Celts, who merged with newcomers from other Germanic tribes during the [[V<U+00F6>lkerwanderung]] following the fall of the Roman empire.

In the medieval period, the [[Low Countries]] (roughly present-day [[Belgium]] and [[the Netherlands]]) consisted of various [[countship]]s, [[duchy|duchies]] and [[diocese]]s belonging to the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. These were united into one state under [[Habsburg]] rule in the 16th century. The [[Counter-Reformation]] following the success of [[Calvinism]] in the Netherlands, and the attempts to centralise government and suppress religious diversity led to a revolt against [[Philip II of Spain]]. On [[26 July]] [[1581]], independence was declared, and finally recognised after the [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568-1648). The years of the war also marked the beginning of the [[Dutch Golden Age]], a period of great commercial and cultural prosperity roughly spanning the 17th century.

After the French occupation at the beginning of the 19th century, [[the Netherlands]] started out as a monarchy, governed by the [[House of Orange]]. However, after a conservative period, strong [[liberalism|liberal]] sentiments could no longer be ignored, and the country became a [[parliamentary democracy]] with a [[constitutional monarch]] in 1848. It has remained so to this day, with a brief interruption during the [[Netherlands in World War II|occupation by Nazi Germany]].

{{History of the Netherlands}}

[[The Netherlands]] is now a modern, [[Industrialisation|industrialised]] nation and a large exporter of [[agricultural]] products. International trade (literally 'overseas') has always been a central aspect of the Dutch economy (also influencing the culture) and was also an important reason for the struggle for independence and cause of the ensuing wealth.

==Pre-history era==
The [[Netherlands]] have been inhabited since the last [[ice age]]; the oldest remnants that have been found are a hundred thousand years old. During the last ice age, the Netherlands had a [[tundra]] climate with very scarce vegetation. The first inhabitants survived as hunter-gatherers. After the end of the ice age, the area was inhabited by various palaeolithic groups. One group even made canoes (Pesse, around 9000 BC) and after that, around 8000 BC, a mesolithic tribe resided near Bergumermeer (Friesland).
Here they found natural "balls" with iron in them, at the Veluwe, as well as in the South (red iron ore near the rivers in Brabant). The smiths could thus travel from small settlement to settlement with bronze and iron, fabricating tools on-demand such as axes, knives, pins, arrowheads, swords, etc. There is even evidence of the use of "damast-forging"; an advanced way to forge metal (swords) with the advantage of flexible iron with the strength of steel.<br>
The wealth of the Netherlands in the Iron Age can be shown via the "King's grave in Oss" (about 500 BC). There, a true king was buried with some extraordinary objects: an [http://home.versatel.nl/postbus/images/zwoss.jpg iron sword with an inlay of gold and coral]. He was buried in the largest grave mound of Western Europe, which was 52 m wide.

At the time of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] arrival, [[the Netherlands]] were inhabited by various [[Germanic tribes]], who had settled there since around 600 BC, such as the [[Tubanti]], the [[Canninefates]], and the [[Frisians]]. Celtic tribes settled the south, among them the [[Eburones]] and the [[Menapii]]. Several Germanians settled south of the Rhine at the beginning of the Roman settlement, and formed the Germanic tribe of the [[Batavians]] and the [[Toxandri]]. The [[Batavians]] were regarded as good soldiers and fought in many important wars, for instance the conquest of [[Dacia]] (Romania) by the emperor [[Trajan]]. In later [[nationalism|nationalistic]] views, the [[Batavians]] were sometimes regarded as the "true" forefathers of the Dutch, as reflected in the name of the later ''[[Batavian Republic]]''.

== Holy Roman Empire ==
The newcomers merged with the original inhabitants to create three peoples in the [[Low Countries]]: the [[Frisians]] along the coast, the [[Saxons]] in the east and the [[Franks]] in the south. The Franks became [[Christians]] after their king [[Clovis I]] converted in 496. Christianity was introduced in the north after the conquest of Friesland by the Franks. Anglo-Saxon missionaries such as [[Willibrord]], [[Wulfram of Sens|Wulfram]] and [[Boniface]] were active in converting these nations to Christianity. Boniface was martyred by the Frisians in [[Dokkum]] (754). The Saxons in the east were converted before the conquest of Saxony, and became Frankish allies.

The southern part of the Netherlands belonged to the Frankish empire of [[Charlemagne]], with its heartland in what is today [[Belgium]] and northern [[France]], and spanning [[France]], [[Germany]], northern [[Italy]] and much of Western Europe. In the north the Netherlands were a part of [[Frisia]] until 734. In 843, the Frankish empire was divided into three parts, giving rise to France in the west, Germany in the east and a middle empire that lay between the two. Most of the Netherlands was part of the middle empire. Later this middle empire was split: most of the contemporary Dutch-speaking lands became a part of Germany; Flanders became part of France.

From 800 AD to 1000 AD, the Low Countries suffered considerably from [[Viking]] raids (one of which destroyed the wealthy city of [[Dorestad]]). Most of the Netherlands was occupied by the Vikings from 850 to 920. This was about the same time that France and Germany were fighting for supremacy over the middle empire. Resistance to the Vikings, if any, came from local nobles, who gained in stature as a result. Viking supremacy ended in 920 when King [[Henry]] of Germany liberated [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. 

The German kings and emperors dominated the Netherlands in the 10th and 11th century. Germany was called the [[Holy Roman Empire]] after the coronation of King Otto the Great as emperor. The Dutch city of Nijmegen used to be the spot of an important domain of the German emperors. Several German emperors were born and died there. (Byzantine empress Theophanu died in Nijmegen for instance.) Utrecht was also an important city and trading port at the time. German officials closely watched the count of Westfriesland (Holland) in the Rhine delta. The count rebelled in 1018. The county was destined to become a part of [[bishop of Utrecht|Utrecht]] after 1018, but the difficulties between the pope and the emperor saved the county.

Much of the western Netherlands was barely inhabited between the end of the Roman period and around 1100. Around 1000, farmers from Flanders and Utrecht began purchasing the swampy land, draining it and cultivating it. This process happened quickly and the uninhabited territory was settled in only a few generations. They built independent farms that were not part of villages, something unique in Europe at the time. Before this happened the language and culture of most of the people who lived in the area that is now Holland were [[Frisian]]. The area was known as "West Friesland" (''Westfriesland''). As settlement progressed, the area quickly became [[Low Saxon-Low Franconian languages|Low Saxon-Low Franconian]]. This area became known as '[[Holland]]' in the 12th century. (The part of North Holland situated north of [[IJ (bay)|'the IJ]] is still colloquially know as West Friesland).

Around 1000 AD there were several agricultural developments (described sometimes as an agricultural revolution) that resulted in an increase in production, especially food production. The economy started to develop at a fast pace, and the higher productivity allowed workers to farm more land or to become tradesmen. [[Guilds]] were established and markets developed as production exceeded local needs. Also, the introduction of [[currency]] made trading a much easier affair than it had been before. Existing towns grew and new towns sprang into existence around monasteries and castles, and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas. Commerce and town development increased as the population grew.

The [[crusade]]s were popular in the Low Countries and drew many to fight in the [[Holy Land]]. At home, there was relative peace in Europe. Viking, Hungarian and Muslim pillaging had stopped. 
Both the Crusades and the relative peace at home contributed to trade and the growth in commerce.

Cities arose and flourished, especially in [[Flanders]] and [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]]. As the cities grew in wealth and power, they started to buy certain privileges for themselves from the [[monarch|sovereign]], including [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]], the right to self-government and the right to pass laws. In practice, this meant that the wealthiest cities became quasi-independent [[republic]]s in their own right. Two of the most important cities were [[Brugge]] and [[Antwerp]] which would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in Europe. 

The Holy Roman Empire was not able to maintain political unity. In addition to the growing independence of the towns, local rulers turned their counties and duchies into private kingdoms and felt little sense of obligation to the emperor who governed over large parts of the nation in name only. Large parts of what now comprise the Netherlands were governed by the Count of [[Holland]], the Duke of [[Gelre]], the Duke of Brabant and the Bishop of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]]. [[Friesland]] and [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] in the north maintained their independence and were governed by the lower nobility. 

The various feudal states were in a state of almost continual war. [[Gelre]] and [[Holland]] fought for control of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]]. Utrecht, whose bishop had in 1000 ruled over half of what is today the Netherlands, was marginalised as it experienced continuing difficulty in electing new bishops. At the same time, the dynasties of neighbouring states were more stable. [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Drenthe]] and most of [[Gelre]], which used to be part of Utrecht, became independent. Brabant tried to conquer its neighbours, but was not successful. [[Holland]] also tried to assert itself in Zeeland and [[Friesland]], but its attempts failed.

[[Friesland]] in the north continued to maintain its independence during this time. It had its own institutions (collectively called the "Frisian Freedom") and resented the imposition of the feudal system and the patriciate found in other European towns. They regarded themselves as allies of Switzerland. The Frisian battle cry was "better dead than a slave". They later lost their independence when they were defeated in 1498 by the German [[Landsknecht]] mercenaries of Duke Albrecht of Saxony-Meissen.

== Burgundian period ==
Most of what is now the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] was eventually united by the Duke of [[Burgundy]] in 1433. Before the Burgundian union, the Dutch identified themselves by the town where they lived, their local duchy or county or as subjects of the Holy Roman Empire. The Burgundian period is when the Dutch began the road to nationhood. 

The conquest of the county of Holland by the Duke [[Philip the Good]] of Burgundy was an odd affair. Leading noblemen in Holland in fact invited the duke to conquer Holland, even though he had no historical claim to it. Some historians say that the ruling class in Holland wanted Holland to integrate with the Flemish economic system and adopt Flemish legal institutions. Europe had been wracked by many civil wars in the 14th and 15th centuries, while Flanders had grown rich and enjoyed peace. 

After a few years of conflict, the countess of Holland was deposed in favour of the Burgundian dukes. Holland's trade developed rapidly, especially in the area of shipping and transport. The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests. The fleets of Holland defeated the fleets of the [[Hanseatic League]] several times. Amsterdam grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the Baltic region. Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium, Northern France and England. This trade was vital to the people of Holland, because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself. Land drainage had caused the peat of the former [[wetland]]s to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained. 

[[Gelre]] resented Burgundian rule. It tried to build up its own state in northeast Netherlands and northwest Germany. Lacking funds in the 16th century, [[Gelre]] had its soldiers provide for themselves by pillaging enemy terrain. These soldiers were a great menace to the Burgundian Netherlands. One notorious event was the pillaging of The Hague. [[Gelre]] was allied with France, England and Denmark, who wanted to put an end to the wealth of Flanders and [[Antwerp]] and Burgundian rule over the Low Countries.

== Struggle for independence and the Golden Age ==
=== Eighty Years' War ===
:''For details, see the main [[Eighty Years' War]] article.''

[[Image:Prinsenvlag.svg|right|thumb|150px|Flag of the revolt <U+2014> orange, white, blue]]
Through inheritance and conquest, all of the [[Low Countries]] became possessions of the [[Habsburg]] dynasty under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in the 16th century, who united them into one state. The east of the Netherlands was occupied only a few decades before the Dutch struggle for independence. However, in 1548, eight years before his abdication from the throne, Emperor Charles V granted the [[Seventeen Provinces]] of the Netherlands status as an entity separate from both the Empire and from [[France]]. This [[Pragmatic Sanction]] of 1548 was not full independence, but it allowed significant autonomy.

Charles was succeeded by his son [[Philip II of Spain]]. Unlike his father, who had been raised in [[Ghent]] ([[Belgium]]), Philip had little personal attachment to the Low Countries (where he had only stayed for four years), and thus was perceived as detached by the local nobility. A devout [[Catholic]], Philip was appalled by the success of the [[Reformation]] in the [[Low Countries]], which had led to an increasing number of [[Calvinism|Calvinists]]. John Lothrop Motley writes: "On February 16, 1568 a sentence of the Holy Office condemned all the inhabitants of the Netherlands to death as heretics. From this universal doom only a few persons, especially named, were acquitted. A proclamation of the king, dated ten days later, confirmed this decree of the Inquisition and ordered it to be carried out into instant execution without regard to age and sex. This is the most concise death warrant that had ever been framed. Three million people&mdash;men, women and children&mdash;were sentenced to the scaffold." (The Rise of the Dutch Republic, by John Lothrop Motley, Volume 1, Part 2, Chapter 2, par. 12, p. 2.) This was not carried out, although the inhabitants of some cities not immediately surrendering to the Spanish army were killed. This was a common military practise at that time. The attempts of Philip II to enforce religious persecution of the Protestants and his endeavours to centralise government, justice and taxes made him unpopular and led to a [[revolt]]. The Dutch fought for independence from [[Spain]], leading to the [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568-1648). Seven rebellious provinces united in the [[Union of Utrecht]] in 1579 and formed the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]] (also known as the "United Provinces").

[[William I of Orange|William of Orange]], one of the best-known scions of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]], from whom every [[Dutch monarchy|Dutch monarch]] is descended (albeit through his granddaughter [[Albertina Agnes]]), led the Dutch during the first part of the war. The very first years were a success for the Spanish troops. However, subsequent sieges in [[Holland]] were countered by the Dutch. The Spanish king lost much popular support in the Netherlands after the sack of Antwerp by mutinous Spanish soldiers, killing 10,000 inhabitants. The conservative Catholics in the south and east supported the Spanish. The Spanish recaptured [[Antwerp]] and other [[Flanders|Flemish]] and Dutch cities. It recaptured most of the territory in the south, but not in the northern seven provinces, leading to the historical split between [[The Netherlands]] and [[Flanders]]. Flanders was the most radical anti-Spanish territory. Many Flemish were allowed to migrate with their possessions. Many rich traders and skilled craftsmen fled to England, Emden and Holland, among them half of the population of Antwerp, three-fourths of Brugge and Ghent and the entire population of Nieuwpoort, Dunkerque and its surrounding countryside. The war dragged on for another 60 years, but the main fighting was over. The [[Peace of Westphalia]], signed on [[January 30]], [[1648]], confirmed the independence of the United Provinces from [[Spain]] and [[Germany]]. The Dutch had not regarded themselves as Germans since the [[15th century]], but they had officially remained a part of the Holy Roman Empire until 1648. As Holland was the most important province by far, the republic of the Seven Provinces came to be known in foreign countries as Holland.

These events were only part of a continent-wide scene of turmoil. See [[Spanish Armada]] for a view of some of the history from further west.

=== Golden Age ===
:''For details on the social and cultural history of the Golden Age, see the [[Dutch Golden Age]] article.

During the Eighty Years' War the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] became the most important trading centre of Northern Europe, instead of Flanders; they [[whaling|hunted whales]] near [[Svalbard]], traded [[spices]] with [[India]] and [[Indonesia]] (via the [[Dutch East India Company]], the first company to issue [[shares]]) and started colonies in [[Brazil]], [[New Amsterdam]] (now [[New York]]), [[South Africa]] and the [[West Indies]]. This new nation flourished culturally and economically, creating what historian [[Simon Schama]] has called an "embarrassment of riches". Speculation in the tulip trade led to a first [[stock market crash]] in 1637, but the economic crisis was soon overcome. Part of  the wealth of the Dutch came through [[slavery]]. In 1619 The Netherlands began the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] between Africa and America, by 1650 becoming the pre-eminent slave trading country in Europe, a position overtaken by Britain around 1700. The port city of [[Amsterdam]] was the European capital of slavery, helping to manage the slave trade also of neighbouring nations and with up to 10,000 slaving vessels associated with the port. 

The 17th century, as a period of economic prosperity and great cultural achievements, is often called the [[Dutch Golden Age|Golden Age]] (''de gouden eeuw'') of the Netherlands. As the Netherlands was a [[republic]], it was largely governed by an aristocracy of city-merchants called the regents (''regenten''), rather than by a [[monarch|king]]. Every city and province had its own government and laws, and a large degree of autonomy. After attempts to find a competent sovereign proved unsuccessful, it was decided that [[sovereignty]] would be vested in the various provincial Estates (''Staten''), the governing bodies of the provinces. The [[Estates-General of the Netherlands|Estates-General]] (''Staten-Generaal''), with its representatives from all the provinces, would decide on matters important to the Republic as a whole. However, at the head of each province was the [[stadtholder]] (''Stadhouder'') of that province, a position held by a descendant of the [[House of Orange]]. Usually the stadtholdership of several provinces was held by a single man.

Following the recognition of the independence of the Netherlands, a decline in the wealth of the Dutch set in. In 1650, the [[stadtholder]] [[William II, Prince of Orange]] died, leaving the nation without a powerful ruler. Since the conception of the Republic, there had been an ongoing struggle for power between the regents and the House of Orange, whose supporters, [[Orangists]], were mainly to be found among the common people. For now, the dispute was decided in favour of the regents: there would be no new [[stadtholder]] (in [[Holland]]) for 22 years to come. In the year 1651, [[England]] imposed the [[1651 Navigation Act]], which severely hurt Dutch trade interests. An incident at sea concerning the Act resulted in the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], which lasted from 1652 to 1654, ending in the [[Treaty of Westminster (1654)]], by which the Navigation Act remained in effect.

1672 is known in the Netherlands as the "Disastrous Year" (''Rampjaar''). England declared war on the Republic, (the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]]), followed by [[France]], [[M<U+00FC>nster]] and [[Cologne]], which had all signed alliances against the Republic. France, Cologne and M<U+00FC>nster invaded the Republic, while an English attempt to land on the Dutch shore could only just be prevented. In the meantime, a new [[stadtholder]], William III, was appointed. With the aid of friendly German nations, the Dutch succeeded in fighting back [[Cologne]] and [[M<U+00FC>nster]], after which the peace was signed with both of them, and England as well, in 1674 (Second [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)]]). In 1678, peace was made with France, although the Spanish and German allies felt betrayed by the treaty signed in [[Nijmegen]].

In the course of the [[Glorious Revolution]], [[William III of Orange|William III]], landed in England at the request of notable English citizens, and dethroned [[James II of England]].

Many immigrants went to the cities in the county of Holland in the 17th and 18th century. They came especially from Protestant Germany. The amount of first generation [[immigration|immigrants]] from outside the Netherlands in Amsterdam was nearly 50% in the 17th and 18th century. If you add immigrants from the second and third generation and immigrants from the Dutch countryside, then the city was mainly inhabited by immigrants. People in most parts of Europe were very poor, and there was a lot of unemployment. But in Amsterdam there was always work. Tolerance was important, because a continuous influx of immigrants was necessary for the economy. Travellers were surprised that the police didn't control them in Amsterdam. The Netherlands also sheltered many famous [[refugees]], including Flemish Protestants; Portuguese and German Jews; French Protestants (Huguenots); the founder of modern philosophy, [[Descartes]]; and the [[Pilgrim Fathers]], who were symbols for the US tradition of [[republicanism]].

The Dutch economy stagnated from the end of the 17th century until the end of the 18th century. The Netherlands slowly lost its position as trading centre of Northern Europe. Amsterdam was a central financial market and bookmarket in Europe but lost this position to London.

In foreign affairs, the Netherlands tried to contain France, but it changed its foreign policy in the 18th century. The Netherlands was still regarded as a major state, when actual power was over. In the 18th century, the Netherlands tried to maintain its independence and kept a policy of neutrality. French invasions in 1672, 1701 and 1748 led to an overthrow of government. The prince of Orange became the most important ruler in 1672 and 1748. The Netherlands was a true republic from 1650&ndash;1672 and 1702&ndash;1748.

== Batavian revolution ==
[[Image:Napoleon1.jpg|thumb|right|120px|[[Napol<U+00E9>on Bonaparte|Napol<U+00E9>on]] turned the Netherlands into the [[Kingdom of Holland]] in 1806.]]
At the end of the 18th century, there was growing unrest in the Netherlands. There was conflict between the [[Orangists]], who wanted stadtholder [[William V of Orange]] to hold more power, and the [[Patriots (faction)|Patriots]], who under the influence of the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution]]s wanted a more democratic form of government. The opening shot of this abortive 'Batavian' revolution might be considered the manifesto published by  [[Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol]], the founder of the 'Patriots' in 1781: ''Aan het Volk van Nederland'' (To the people of the Netherlands). After the Netherlands became the second nation to recognise US independence, the British declared war. This [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]] (1780&ndash;1784) proved a disaster for the Netherlands, particularly economically. Its peace treaty, according to [[Fernand Braudel]] "sounded the knell of Dutch greatness." (Braudel 1984 p. 273). In 1785 there was a rebellion by the Patriots, an armed insurrection by local militias determined to defend municipal democracies in certain Dutch towns. "Seen as a whole this revolution is a string of violent and confused events, accidents, speeches, rumours, bitter enmities and armed confrontations." says Braudel, who sees it as a forerunner of the [[French Revolution]], with the constant slogan "''vrijheid"''.  But the House of Orange, backed by British policy, called upon their [[Prussia|Prussian]] relatives to suppress it. The Orangist reaction was severe: no one dared appear in public without an orange cockade and there were lynchings, the old burgomasters were replaced and a small unpaid Prussian army was billeted in the Netherlands supporting themselves with looting and extortion, Many Patriots fled the country to Brabant or France, perhaps 40,000 in all.

== Batavian Republic and French rule ==
:''For more detailed discussions, see the [[Batavian Republic]] and the [[Kingdom of Holland]].''
Against this background it is less surprising that, after the [[French Revolution]], when the French army invaded and occupied the Netherlands in 1795, the French encountered so little united resistance. [[William V of Orange]] fled to England. The Patriots proclaimed the short-lived [[Batavian Republic]], but government was soon returned to stabler and more experienced hands. In 1806 [[Napoleon]] restyled the Netherlands (along with a small part of what is now Germany) into the [[Kingdom of Holland]], with his brother [[Louis Bonaparte|Louis (Lodewijk) Bonaparte]] as king. This too was short-lived, however. [[Napoleon]] incorporated the Netherlands into the [[First French Empire|French empire]] after his brother put Dutch interests ahead of those of the French. The French occupation of the Netherlands ended in 1813 after Napoleon was defeated, a defeat in which [[William I of the Netherlands|William VI of Orange]] played a prominent role.

On November 30 1813, [[William I of the Netherlands|William VI of Orange]] took ashore in [[Scheveningen]] and was proclaimed the Souvereign Prince of the [[United Netherlands]] (Dutch: ''Vereenigde Nederlanden''). This state was superseded by the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in 1815, after the unification of the northern Netherlands with the [[Austrian Netherlands]] under [[William I of the Netherlands|William VI of Orange]].

During the Napoleonic occupation, the House of Orange signed a treaty with the English in which it gave to that country the Dutch colonies in 'safekeeping' and ordered the colonial governors to surrender to the British. This put an end to much of the Dutch colonial empire. [[Guyana]] and [[Ceylon]] never returned to Dutch rule. The Cape Colony, which had changed hands several times, remained British after 1806. Other colonies, including what is today [[Indonesia]], were returned to the Netherlands under the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]]. Ten years later there was another treaty&mdash;the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]].

== Monarchy ==
:''For details on the Dutch monarchy, see the [[Dutch monarchy]] article.''

After the Napoleonic era the Netherlands were put back on the map of Europe. The country had always been part of the precarious balance of power that had kept France in check. Particularly the [[Russia]]n [[tsar]] wanted the Netherlands to resume this role and wanted the colonies to be returned. A compromise was struck with the United Kingdom at the [[Congress of Vienna]], whereby only Indonesia was returned, but the North and South of the Netherlands reunited. In 1815 the country became a monarchy, with the son of  the last [[stadtholder]], William V, the Prince of Orange as king [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]]. In addition, king William I became hereditary [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]]. William's [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] originally consisted of what is now the Netherlands and [[Belgium]], but the French-speaking Belgian ruling minority soon began feeling like second-class citizens. The primary factors that contributed to this feeling were religious (the predominantly [[Catholic]] South versus the mostly [[Protestantism|Protestant]] North), economic (the South was industrialising, the North had always been a merchants' nation) and linguistic (the French-speaking South was not just [[Wallonia]], but also extended to the French-speaking [[bourgeoisie]] in the Flemish cities). In 1830 the situation exploded, the Belgians revolted and declared independence from the North. King William sent an army in 1831, but it was forced to retreat after a few days when the French army was mobilised.  The North refused to recognise [[Belgium]] until 1839.

In 1848 [[Revolutions of 1848|unrest broke out all over Europe]]. Although there were no major events in the Netherlands, these foreign developments persuaded king [[William II of the Netherlands|William II]] to agree to liberal and democratic reform. That same year the [[liberalism|liberal]] [[Johan Rudolf Thorbecke]] was asked by the king to rewrite the [[constitution]], turning the Netherlands into a [[constitutional monarchy]]. The new document was proclaimed valid on [[November 3]] of that year. It severely limited the king's powers (making the cabinet accountable only to an elected [[parliament]]), and it protected [[civil liberties]].

The [[personal union]] between the Netherlands and Luxembourg ended in 1890 when [[Queen Wilhelmina]] ascended to the Dutch throne, as ascendancy rules in Luxembourg prevented a woman from becoming ruling [[Grand Duchess]].

By the end of the 19th century, in the [[New Imperialism]] wave of colonisation, the Netherlands extended their hold on [[Indonesia]]. In 1860 [[Multatuli]] wrote ''[[Max Havelaar]]'', the most famous book in the history of [[Dutch literature]], criticising the exploitation of the country and its inhabitants by the Dutch.

== 20th century ==

Although its army mobilised when [[World War I]] broke out in August 1914, the Netherlands remained a [[neutral country]]. The [[Germany|German]] invasion of [[Belgium]] that same year led to a large flow of refugees from that country (about 1 million). The country being surrounded by states at war, and with the [[North Sea]] unsafe for civilian ships to sail on, food became scarce and was distributed using coupons. With the end of the war in 1918, the situation returned to normalcy.

Although both houses of the Dutch parliament were elected by the people, only men with high incomes were eligible for voting  until 1918, when pressure from [[Socialism|socialist]] movements had resulted in elections in which all men were allowed to vote. In 1922 women also got the right to vote.

The worldwide [[Great Depression]] of 1929 and the early 1930s had crippling effects on the Dutch economy, effects which lasted longer than they did in most European countries. The depression lead to large unemployment and poverty, as well as increasing social unrest. The rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany did not go unnoticed in the Netherlands, and there was growing concern over the possibility of armed conflict. But most Dutch citizens thought that Germany would again respect Dutch neutrality.

At the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, the Netherlands declared their [[neutral country|neutrality]] again. However, on [[May 10]], [[1940]], [[Nazi Germany]] launched an attack on the Netherlands and Belgium and overran most of the country quickly, fighting against a poorly-equipped Dutch army. By [[May 14]], fighting was only occurring in a few isolated locations. However, on that very day, the [[Luftwaffe]] bombed [[Rotterdam]], the second largest city of the Netherlands, killing about 800 people and destroying large parts of the city, leaving 78,000 homeless. Following the bombardment and German threats of the same for [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], the Netherlands capitulated on [[May 15]] (except the province of [[Zeeland]]).  The royal family and some military forces fled to the [[United Kingdom]].  Some members of the royal family eventually moved to [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]] until the Netherlands was liberated, and [[Princess Margriet of the Netherlands|Princess Margriet]] was born during this Canadian exile.

Persecution of [[Jew]]s, of which about 140,000 lived in the Netherlands at the beginning of the war, started shortly after the invasion. At the end of the war, only 40,000 Jews were still alive. Of the 100,000 Jews that didn't hide, only 1000 survived the war. [[Anne Frank]], who later gained world-wide fame when her diary, written in the ''Achterhuis'' (''backhouse''), while hiding from the Nazis, was found and published, died shortly before the liberation of her camp on [[May 5]], [[1945]]. 

Resentment about the German presence grew as the occupation regime bacame harsher, prompting many Dutch to join the [[Dutch resistance|resistance]]. However, collaboration was not uncommon either; many thousands of young Dutch males also volunteered for combat service on the Russian Front with the [[Waffen-SS]]. 

Japanese forces invaded the [[Dutch East Indies]] on [[January 11]], [[1942]]. The Dutch surrendered on [[March 8]], after Japanese troops landed on [[Java island|Java]]. Dutch citizens were captured and put to work in labour camps. However, many Dutch ships and military personnel managed to reach [[Australia]], from where they were able to fight against the Japanese.

In Europe, after the [[Allies of WWII|Allies]] landed in [[Normandy]] in June 1944, progress was slow until the [[Battle of Normandy]] ended in August 1944. As German resistance collapsed in western Europe, the allies advanced quickly towards the Dutch border. [[First Canadian Army]] and the 2nd British Army both conducted major operations on Dutch soil beginning in September.  On [[17 September]] a daring operation, [[Operation Market Garden]], was executed with the goal of capturing bridges across three major rivers in the southern Netherlands. Despite desperate fighting by American, British and Polish forces, the bridge at [[Arnhem]], across the [[Rhine|Neder Rijn]], could  not be captured. However, areas south of the Neder Rijn were liberated in the period September&ndash;November 1944, including the province of Zeeland which was liberated in the [[Battle of the Scheldt]]. However, the rest of the country, with a major part of the population, remained occupied until the spring of 1945. The winter 1944&ndash;1945 was very harsh, and many Dutch starved, giving the winter the name ''[[Hongerwinter]]'' (Hunger winter). On [[May 5]], [[1945]], a beaten Nazi Germany finally capitulated, signing the surrender to the Dutch at [[Wageningen]].  After the war, [[Artur Seyss-Inquart]], the Nazi Commissioner of the Netherlands, was tried at Nuremberg. 

To this day, [[Canada]]'s role in the nation's liberation, as well as its role in providing a safe haven for the royal family during the war, has led to a warm relationship between the nations that is deeply honoured.

===Post-war years===
[[Image:Id-map.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Indonesia]], the former [[Dutch East Indies]], had been a very valuable resource, and the Dutch feared its independence would lead to an economic downfall.]]

Two days after the surrender of Japan, most of the Dutch East Indies declared its independence as [[Indonesia]]. A confusing phase followed, known as the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], with the Netherlands recognising the new country on the one hand, while fighting the Indonesian nationalists in two wars, named ''politionele acties'' ("police actions"). Increasing international pressure led the Netherlands to eventually withdraw. Indonesia formally gained independence on [[December 27]], [[1949]]. Part of the former Dutch East Indies, namely the western part of [[New Guinea]], remained under Dutch control as [[Netherlands New Guinea]] until 1961 when the Netherlands transferred sovereignty to Indonesia, following Indonesian threats to invade the region.

Although it was originally expected that the loss of the [[Indies]] would lead to an economic downfall, the reverse proved to be true, and in the 1950s and 60s the Dutch economy experienced a near unprecedented growth. In fact, the demand for labour was so strong, that immigration was actively encouraged, first from [[Italy]] and [[Spain]]; then later on, in larger numbers, from [[Turkey]] and [[Morocco]]. Combined with the immigration from (former) colonies like [[Indonesia]], [[Surinam]] and [[Netherlands Antilles]], this meant that the Netherlands was becoming a [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] country.

The 60s and 70s were a time of great social and cultural changes. Such as rapid ''[[pillarization|ontzuiling]]'' (literally: depillarisation), a term that describes the decay of the old divisions along class and religious lines (which had led to things like separate education and separate TV broadcasts for Catholics, Protestants, socialists and liberals). Youths, and students in particular, rejected traditional mores, and pushed for change in matters like [[women's rights]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[disarmament]] (See: [[Hollanditis]]) and [[environmental issues]]. Today, the Netherlands is regarded as a very [[liberalism|liberal]] country, considering [[drug policy of the Netherlands|its drugs policy]] and [[Euthanasia#The Netherlands|its legalisation of euthanasia]]. [[same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|Same-sex marriage]] became permitted on [[1 April]] [[2001]].

In 1952 the Netherlands were among the founders of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which would over time evolve into the [[European Union]]. The Netherlands is an industrialised nation but also a large exporter of agricultural products. The country was a founding member of [[NATO]] and participated in the introduction of the [[euro]] in 1999. In recent years the Dutch have often been a driving force behind the integration of European countries in the European Union.

On [[6 May]] [[2002]], the murder on [[Pim Fortuyn]], a right-wing [[populism|populist]] calling for a very strict policy on immigration, shocked the country. His party became a major political force after the elections, significantly changing the political landscape. However, infighting within the party caused them to lose much of their following in elections the next year. Another murder that drew much attention took place on [[2 November]] [[2004]], when film director and publicist [[Theo van Gogh]] was assassinated by a Dutch-Moroccan youth with radical Islamic beliefs. This sparked debate on the existence of [[radical Islam]] in the Netherlands, and on immigration and integration (or lack thereof) as well.
