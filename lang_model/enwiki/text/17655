Located in [[northern India]] on the banks of the [[River Yamuna]], Delhi has the political status of a federally-administered [[union territory]] known as the '''National Capital Territory of Delhi'''. Under a Constitutional amendment in 1991, Delhi was given its own legislative assembly with limited powers. The metropolis consists of three coterminous census towns &ndash; Delhi, [[Delhi Cantonment]], [[New Delhi]] &ndash; along with 214 villages.  

Capital to several empires in [[History of India|ancient India]], Delhi was a major city in the old trade routes from northwest India to the [[Gangetic Plains]].

During the [[British Raj]],  New Delhi was built as an administrative quarter of the city. New Delhi was declared the capital of India after India gained [[History of the Republic of India|independence]] from British rule in 1947. As the seat of the Government of India, New Delhi houses important offices of the federal government, including the [[Parliament of India]]. Delhi has grown up to be a cosmopolitan city owing to the immigration of people from across the country. Like many other large cities of the world, Delhi suffers from urbanisation problems such as pollution, traffic congestion and scarcity of resources. The rapid development and urbanisation of New Delhi and surrounding areas coupled with the high average income of the populace has largely eclipsed  socio-cultural traits that used to represent Delhi until a few years after Independence.<ref name=jacob>{{cite journal

Most of the Delhi metropolitan area lies within the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT). The NCT has three local municipal corporations: [[Municipal Corporation of Delhi]] (MCD), [[New Delhi Municipal Council]] (NDMC) and [[Delhi Cantonment|Delhi Cantonment Board]]. MCD is one of the largest municipal corporations in the world providing civic amenities to an estimated 13.78&nbsp;million people.<ref name="MCD"> {{cite web |url=http://www.mcdonline.gov.in/|title=About Us|publisher=Municipal Corporation of Delhi|accessdate=2006-05-13}}</ref> The capital of India, New Delhi, falls under the administration of NDMC. The chairperson of the NDMC is appointed by the Government of India in consultation with the [[Chief Minister of Delhi]].

Delhi has four major satellite cities which lie outside the National Capital Territory of Delhi. These are [[Gurgaon]] and [[Faridabad]] (in Haryana), and [[New Okhla Industrial Development Authority|NOIDA]] and [[Ghaziabad]] (in Uttar Pradesh). The National Capital Territory of Delhi is divided into nine districts. Each district is headed by a Deputy Commissioner and has three subdivisions. A Subdivision Magistrate heads each subdivision. All Deputy Commissioners report to the Divisional Commissioner.<!--what is a "division"? That has not been explained. There are districts and subdivisions only, it seems. Then what does a Divisional Commissioner do?--> The District Administration of Delhi is the enforcing department for all kinds of State and Central Government policies and exercises supervisory powers over numerous other functionaries of the Government.

The [[Delhi High Court]] exercises jurisdiction over the National Capital Territory of Delhi. Delhi also has [[lower court]]s; the [[Small Causes Court]] for civil cases, and the [[Sessions Court]] for criminal cases. The [[Delhi Police]], headed by the [[Police Commissioner of Delhi|Police Commissioner]], is one of the largest metropolitan police forces in the world.<ref name=largepolice>{{cite web

==Government and politics==

[[Image:Northblockindelhi.JPG|thumb|The [[North Block]] in Raisina Hill, New Delhi houses the Indian Home Ministry and Ministry of Finance.]]
As a special Union Territory, the National Capital Territory of Delhi has its own Legislative Assembly, Lieutenant Governor, Council of Ministers and Chief Minister. The Chief Minister is appointed by the [[President of India]] and the other Ministers are appointed by the President on the advice of the Chief Minister.<ref name=NCTact/> The legislative assembly seats are filled by direct election from territorial constituencies in the NCT. However, the Union Government of India and the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi jointly administer New Delhi. New Delhi, an urban area in Delhi, is the seat of both the State Government of Delhi and the Government of India. The [[Parliament of India]], the [[Rashtrapati Bhavan]] (Presidential Palace) and the [[Supreme Court of India]] are located in New Delhi. There are 70 assembly constituencies and seven [[Lok Sabha]] (Indian parliament's lower house) constituencies in Delhi.<ref name=assmbconst>{{cite web

Delhi was a traditional stronghold of the [[Indian National Congress]], also known as the Congress Party. In the 1990s the [[BJP|Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) under the leadership of [[Madan Lal Khurana]] came into power for the first time. However, in 1998 [[Sheila Dixit]] of the Indian National Congress defeated Madan Lal Khurana in state elections and Congress has retained power since then.
