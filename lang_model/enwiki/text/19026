'''Ine''' was [[List of monarchs of Wessex|King]] of [[Wessex]] from 688 to 726. He was unable to retain the territorial gains of his predecessor, [[C<U+00E6>dwalla of Wessex|C<U+00E6>dwalla]], who had brought much of [[southern England]] under his control and expanded West Saxon territory substantially. By the end of Ine's reign the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]] and [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]] were no longer under West Saxon domination; however, Ine maintained control of what is now [[Hampshire]], and consolidated and extended Wessex's territory in the western peninsula.

Ine is noted for his code of laws, which he issued in about 694.  These laws were the first issued by an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] king outside Kent. They shed much light on the history of Anglo-Saxon society, and reveal Ine's [[Christian]] convictions. Trade increased significantly during Ine's reign, with the town of Hamwic (now [[Southampton]]) becoming prominent. It was probably during Ine's reign that the West Saxons began to mint coins, though none have been found that bear his name.

Ine abdicated in 726 to go to [[Rome]], leaving the kingdom to "younger men", in the words of the contemporary chronicler [[Bede]]. He was succeeded by [[<U+00C6>thelheard of Wessex|<U+00C6>thelheard]].

==Genealogy and accession==
Early sources agree that Ine was the son of [[Cenred of Wessex|Cenred]], and that Cenred was the son of [[Ceolwald of Wessex|Ceolwald]]; further back there is less agreement.<ref name=Swanton_42>Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 42<U+2013>43.</ref> Ine's siblings included a brother, Ingild, and two sisters, [[Cuthburga|Cuthburh]] and Cwenburg.  Cuthburh was married to King [[Aldfrith of Northumbria]],<ref name=Kirby_143>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 143.</ref> and Ine himself was married to [[<U+00C6>thelburg of Wessex|<U+00C6>thelburg]].<ref name=Swanton_42 />  [[Bede]] tells that Ine was "of the blood royal", by which he means the royal line of the [[Gewisse]], the early West Saxon tribal name.<ref name=Bede_PC_276>Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History'', quoted from Leo Sherley-Price's translation, p. 276.</ref>

The genealogy of Ine and of the kings of Wessex is known from two sources: the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' and the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List. The Chronicle was created in the late ninth century, probably at the court of [[Alfred the Great]], and some of its annals incorporated short genealogies of kings of Wessex. These are often at variance with the more extensive information in the Regnal List.<ref name=Y_S>For a discussion of the Chronicle and Regnal List see Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', pp. 128<U+2013>129. For a recent translation of both sources, see Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 2, 40&ndash;41.</ref> The inconsistencies appear to result from the efforts of later chroniclers to demonstrate that each king on the list was descended from [[Cerdic of Wessex|Cerdic]], the founder, according to the Chronicle, of the West Saxon line in England.<ref name=Yorke_142>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', pp. 142&ndash;143.</ref>

Ine's predecessor on the throne of Wessex was [[C<U+00E6>dwalla of Wessex|C<U+00E6>dwalla]], but there is some uncertainty about the transition from C<U+00E6>dwalla to Ine. C<U+00E6>dwalla [[abdicate]]d in 688 and departed for [[Rome]] to be baptised. According to the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List, Ine reigned for 37 years, abdicating in 726. These dates imply that he did not gain the throne until 689, which could indicate an unsettled period between C<U+00E6>dwalla's abdication and Ine's accession.  Ine may have ruled alongside his father, Cenred, for a period: there is weak evidence for joint kingships, and stronger evidence of subkings reigning under a dominant ruler in Wessex, not long before this time.<ref name=Yorke_145>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p.145&ndash;146</ref>  Ine acknowledges his father's help in his code of laws,<ref name=Kirby_122>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 122.</ref> and there is also a surviving land-grant that indicates Cenred was still reigning in Wessex after Ine's accession.<ref name=ASP_S45>{{cite web | url = http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1164 | title = Anglo-Saxons.net S 1164 | accessdate=4 July 2007 }}</ref><ref name=Kirby_120>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 120.</ref>

==Reign==
[[Image:British seventh century kingdoms.gif|thumb|right|200px|The kingdoms of Britain in the late seventh century.]]

The extent of West Saxon territory at the start of Ine's reign is fairly well known. The upper [[River Thames|Thames]] valley on both sides of the river had long been the territory of the Gewisse, though C<U+00E6>dwalla had lost territory north of the river to the kingdom of [[Mercia]] before Ine's accession. To the west, [[Ceawlin of Wessex]] is known to have reached the [[Bristol Channel]] one hundred years before.<ref name=Stenton_29>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 29.</ref> The West Saxons had since expanded further down the southwestern peninsula, pushing back the boundary with the British kingdom of [[Dumnonia]], which was probably roughly equivalent to modern [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]].<ref name=Stenton_72>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 72&ndash;73.</ref> On the West Saxons<U+2019> eastern border was the kingdom of the [[East Saxons]], which included [[London]] and what is now [[Surrey]]. To the southeast were the [[South Saxons]], on the coast east of the [[Isle of Wight]]. Beyond Sussex lay the kingdom of Kent.<ref name=BlairRBaEE_12>Blair, ''Roman Britain'', p. 209.</ref>  Ine<U+2019>s predecessor, C<U+00E6>dwalla, had made himself overlord of most of these southern kingdoms,<ref name=Yorke_137>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', pp. 137<U+2013>138.</ref> though he had not been able to prevent Mercian inroads along the upper Thames.<ref name=Stenton_72/>

Ine retained control of the Isle of Wight, and made further advances in Dumnonia, but the territorial gains C<U+00E6>dwalla had made in Sussex, Surrey and Kent were all lost by the end of Ine's reign.<ref name=Stenton_72/>

===Kent, Essex, Sussex, and Surrey===
Ine made peace with [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] in 694, when its king [[Wihtred of Kent|Wihtred]] gave Ine a substantial sum in compensation for the death of C<U+00E6>dwalla's brother [[Mul of Kent|Mul]], who had been killed during a Kentish rebellion in 687. The value of the amount offered to Ine by Wihtred is uncertain; most manuscripts of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle record "thirty thousand", and some specify thirty thousand pounds. If the pounds are equal to [[sceatta]]s, then this amount is the equal of a king's [[wergild]]&mdash;that is, the legal valuation of a man's life, according to his rank.<ref name=Swanton_40_2>Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', 40&ndash;41, note 3.</ref><ref name=Blackwell_469>Lapidge, Michael (ed.), "Wergild", in ''The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 469.</ref>

Ine kept the [[Sussex|South Saxons]], who had been conquered by C<U+00E6>dwalla in 686, in subjugation for a period.<ref name=Blackwell_251>Lapidge, Michael (ed.), "Ine", in ''The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 251.</ref> King [[Nothhelm of Sussex]] is referred to in a charter of 692 as a kinsman of Ine (perhaps by marriage).<ref name=ASP_S45 /><ref name=Kirby_125>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 125&ndash;126.</ref> Sussex was still under West Saxon domination in 710, when Nothhelm is recorded as having campaigned with Ine in the west against Dumnonia.<ref name=Stenton_72 />

Control of Surrey, which may never have been an independent kingdom, passed between Kent, Mercia, Essex, and Wessex in the years before Ine's reign.  Essex also included London, and the diocese of London included Surrey; this appears to have been a source of friction between Ine and the East Saxon and Mercian kings, until the province was transferred to the diocese of Winchester in 705.<ref name=Yorke_49>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 49.</ref>  Evidence for Ine's early control of Surrey comes from the introduction to his laws, in which he refers to [[Eorcenwald]], bishop of London, as "my bishop".<ref name=Stenton_72 /><ref name=Eorcenwald>See Eorcenwald, under "Events" and "Law-Making", at {{cite web | url = http://eagle.cch.kcl.ac.uk:8080/pase/persons/index.html | title = Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England | accessdate=17 July 2007 }}</ref> Ine's subsequent relations with the East Saxons are illuminated by a letter written in 704 or 705 by Bishop Wealdhere of London to [[Bertwald|Brihtwold]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. The letter refers to "disputes and discords" that had arisen "between the king of the West Saxons and the rulers of our country". The rulers that Wealdhere refers to are [[Sigeheard of Essex|Sigeheard]] and [[Swaefred of Essex|Swaefred]] of the East Saxons, and the cause of the discord was the East Saxons' sheltering of exiles from the West Saxons. Ine had agreed to peace on the condition that the exiles were expelled. A council at [[Brentford]] was planned to resolve the disputes.<ref name=Kirby_125/><ref name=EHD_729>A translation of Wealdhere's letter can be found in Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', p. 729.</ref>  By this point Surrey had clearly passed out of West Saxon control.<ref name=Kirby_125 />

Bede records that Ine held Sussex in subjection for "several years",<ref name=Bede_PC_230>Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History'', quoted from Leo Sherley-Price's translation, p. 230.</ref> but in 722 an exile named [[Ealdbert|Ealdberht]] fled to Surrey and Sussex, and Ine invaded Sussex as a result. Three years later Ine invaded again, this time killing Ealdberht. Sussex had evidently broken away from West Saxon domination some time before this.<ref name=Swanton_42 /><ref name=Stenton_72 /> It has been suggested that Ealdberht was a son of Ine, or a son of Ine's brother Ingild.<ref name=Kirby_131>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 131 & note 75.</ref>

===Dumnonia and Mercia===
In 710, Ine and Nothhelm fought against [[Geraint of Dumnonia]], according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle;<ref name=Swanton_42 /> [[John of Worcester]] states that Geraint was killed in this battle.<ref name=Forester_36>John of Worcester was a twelfth-century chronicler who had access to versions of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle that have not survived to the present day.  See Campbell (ed.), ''The Anglo-Saxons'', p. 222.  For the chronicle text, see Forester, ''Chronicle'', p. 36.</ref>  Ine's advance brought him control of what is now [[Devon]], the new border with Dumnonia being the [[river Tamar]].<ref name=Kirby_125 /> The ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'', a tenth century chronicle,<ref name=Higham_170>Higham, ''King Arthur'', p. 170.</ref> records that in 722 the British defeated their enemies at the [[Battle of Hehil]]. The "enemies" must be Ine or his people, but the location is unidentified; historians have suggested locations in both Cornwall and Devon.<ref name=Stenton_72 /><ref name=TF_SW_273>Todd & Fleming, ''The Southwest'', p. 273.</ref>

Ine fought a battle with the [[Mercia]]ns under [[Ceolred of Mercia|Ceolred]] at Woden<U+2019>s Barrow in 715, but the result is not recorded. Woden<U+2019>s Barrow is a [[tumulus]], now called Adam<U+2019>s Grave, at Alton Prior, [[Wiltshire]].<ref name=Swanton_14>Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 14.</ref> Ine may not have recovered any of the lands north of the Thames that had belonged to the West Saxons under previous kings, but it is known that he controlled the southern bank: a charter dated 687 shows him giving land to the church at [[Streatley, Berkshire|Streatley]] on the Thames and at nearby [[Basildon, Berkshire|Basildon]].<ref name=Stenton_72 /><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&type=charter&id=239 | title = Anglo-Saxons.net: S 239 | accessdate=19 July 2007 }}</ref>

===Other conflicts===
In 721, the Chronicle records that Ine slew one Cynewulf, of whom nothing else is known, though his name suggests a connection to the Wessex royal line. A quarrel apparently arose in the royal family soon afterwards: in 722, according to the Chronicle, Ine's queen <U+00C6>thelburg destroyed [[Taunton]], which her husband had built earlier in his reign.<ref name=Swanton_42 />

==Internal affairs==
The first mention of the office of [[ealdorman]] in Wessex, and the first references to the shires they led, occur during Ine's reign.  It may have been Ine who divided Wessex into something approximating the modern counties of Hampshire, Wiltshire, Somerset, Devon, and Dorset, though earlier administrative boundaries might also have influenced these borders.<ref name=Blackwell_251 />  It has also been suggested that these counties began as divisions of the kingdom among members of the royal family.<ref name=Yorke_145/>

By about 710, in the middle of Ine's reign, the trading settlement of Hamwic had become established on the west bank of the river Itchen; the site is now part of the modern city of Southampton.  The goods traded at this port included glass vessels, and finds of animal bones suggest an active trade in hides.  Further evidence of trade comes from finds of imported goods such as quernstones, whetstones, and pottery; and finds of sceattas from the town include Frisian coins.  Specialist trades carried on in the town included cloth-making, smithying, and metalworking.  It is not known whether Ine took an interest in Hamwic, but some of the goods he favoured, including luxuries, were imported there, and the merchants would probably have needed royal protection.  The total population of Hamwic has been estimated at 5,000, and this high population itself implies Ine's involvement, since no-one but the king would have been able to arrange to feed and house such a large group of people.<ref name=CampbellTAS_102>Campbell (ed.), ''The Anglo-Saxons'', p. 102.</ref><ref name=Yorke_139>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', pp. 139<U+2013>140.</ref>

The growth of trade after about 700 was paralleled by an expansion of the area of circulation of the [[sceat]], the common coin of the day, to include the upper Thames valley.<ref name=Kirby_125/>  It is thought that the first West Saxon coinage was minted during Ine's reign, though no coins bearing his name have been found&mdash;sceattas typically gave no hint of the reigning king.<ref name=Blackwell_251 />

==Laws==
[[Image:Peterborough.Chronicle.firstpage.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The initial page of Corpus Christi College Cambridge MS 173, the ''[[Peterborough Chronicle]],'' which contains the oldest surviving copy of Ine's laws.]]

The earliest Anglo-Saxon law code to survive, which may date from 602 or 603, is that of [[<U+00C6>thelberht of Kent]], whose reign ended in 616.<ref name=EHD_357>Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', p. 357.</ref>  In the 670s or 680s, a code was issued in the names of [[Hlothhere of Kent|Hlothhere]] and [[Eadric of Kent]].  The next kings to issue laws were [[Wihtred of Kent]] and Ine.<ref name=EHD_327>Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', pp. 327<U+2013>337.</ref>

The dates of Wihtred<U+2019>s and Ine<U+2019>s laws are somewhat uncertain, but there is reason to believe that Wihtred<U+2019>s laws were issued on 6 September 695,<ref name=EHD_361>Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', p. 361.</ref> while Ine<U+2019>s laws were written in 694 or shortly  before.<ref name=Stenton_72/>  Ine had recently agreed peaceful terms with Wihtred over compensation for the death of Mul, and there are indications that the two rulers collaborated to some degree in producing their laws.  In addition to the coincidence of timing, there is one clause that appears in almost identical form in both codes.<ref law_20>The law is chapter 20 in Ine's code, and chapter 28 in Wihtred's.  Ine's version reads "If a man from a distance or a foreigner goes through the wood off the track, and does not shout nor blow a horn, he is to be assumed to be a thief, to be either killed or redeemed."  Wihtred's version is "If a man from a distance or a foreigner goes off the track, and he neither shouts nor blows a horn, he is to be assumed to be a thief, to be either killed or redeemed." See Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', pp. 364, 366.</ref> Another sign of collaboration is that Wihtred<U+2019>s laws use ''gesith'', a West Saxon term for noble, in place of the Kentish term ''eorlcund''.  It is possible that Ine and Wihtred issued the law codes as an act of prestige, to re-establish authority after periods of disruption in both kingdoms.<ref name=Kirby_125/>

Ine<U+2019>s laws survive only because Alfred the Great appended them to his own code of laws.<ref name=EHD_364>Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', pp. 364<U+2013>372.</ref>  The oldest surviving manuscript, and only complete copy, is [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]] MS 173, which contains both Alfred<U+2019>s and Ine<U+2019>s law codes and the oldest extant text of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.  Two more partial texts survive.  One was originally a complete copy of Ine's laws, part of British Library MS Cotton Otho B xi, but that manuscript was largely destroyed in 1731 by a fire at [[Ashburnham House]] in which only Chapters 66 to 76.2 of Ine's laws escaped destruction.  A fragment of Ine<U+2019>s laws can also be found in British Museum MS Burney 277.<ref name=EHD_327/>

It is possible that we do not have Ine<U+2019>s laws in their original seventh-century form. Alfred mentions in the prologue to his laws that he rejected earlier laws which he disliked. He did not specify what laws he omitted, but if they were the ones no longer relevant in his own time, it cannot be assumed that the surviving version of Ine's laws is complete.<ref name=EHD_327/>

The prologue to Ine's laws lists his advisors.  Three people are named: bishops [[Erkenwald|Eorcenwald]] and [[H<U+00E6>dde]], and Ine<U+2019>s father, King Cenred.  Ine was a Christian king, whose intent to encourage [[Christianity]] is clear from the laws. The oath of a communicant, for example, is declared to carry more weight than that of a non-Christian;<ref name=EHD_327/> and baptism and religious observance are also addressed. Significant attention is also paid to civil issues<U+2014>more than in the contemporary Kentish laws.<ref name=Kirby_124>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 124.</ref>

One of the laws states that [[common land]] might be enclosed by several [[churl|ceorl]]s (the contemporary name for Saxon freemen).  Any ceorl who fails to fence his share, however, and allows his cattle to stray into someone else's field is to be held liable for any damage caused.<ref name=EHD_364/> This does not mean that the land was held in common: each ceorl had his own strip of land that supported him. It is notable that a king's law is required to settle a relatively minor issue; the laws do not mention the role of local lords in obtaining compliance from the ceorls.<ref name=Stenton_279>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 279<U+2013>280.</ref> It is clear from this and other laws that tenants held the land in tenure from a lord; the king's close involvement indicates that the relationship between lord and tenant was under the king's control.<ref name=Stenton_312>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 312<U+2013>314.</ref>

The laws that deal with straying cattle provide the earliest documentary evidence for an [[open field system|open-field farming system]]. They show that open-field agriculture was practiced in Wessex in Ine's time, and it is probable that this was also the prevalent agricultural method throughout the English midlands, and as far north and east as [[Kingdom of Lindsey|Lindsey]] and [[Deira (kingdom)|Deira]]. Not all of Wessex used this system, however: it was not used in Devon, for example.<ref name=Stenton_279/>  The law which mentions a "yard" of land is the first documented mention of that unit. A yard was a unit of land equal to a quarter of a [[hide (unit)|hide]]; a hide was variable from place to place but could be as much as {{convert|120|acre|ha}}. The yard in this sense later became the standard holding of the medieval [[villein]], and was known as the [[virgate]].  One historian has commented that "the beginnings of a manorial economy are clearly visible in Ine's laws."<ref name=Stenton_312 />

The fine for neglecting [[fyrd]], the obligation to do military service for the king, is set at 120 shillings for a nobleman, and half that for a ceorl,<ref name=EHD_364/> incidentally revealing that ceorls were required to serve in the army. Scholars have disagreed on the military value of the ceorl, but it is not surprising that all free men would fight, since defeat might have meant slavery.<ref name=Stenton_290>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 290.</ref>

Another law specified that anyone accused of murder required at least one high-ranking person among his "oath-helpers". An oath-helper would swear an oath on behalf of an accused man, to clear him from the suspicion of the crime. Ine's requirement implies that he did not trust an oath sworn only by peasants. It may represent a significant change from an earlier time when a man's kin were expected to support him with oaths.<ref name=Stenton_316>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 316<U+2013>317.</ref>

The laws made separate provision for Ine's English and British subjects and were neither oppressive to the British nor completely even-handed. The evidence they provide for the incomplete integration of the two populations is supported by research into [[placename]] history, the history of religious houses, and local archaeology, which indicates that the western part of Wessex was thinly settled by the Germanic newcomers at the time the laws were issued.<ref name=Yorke_137/> It is notable that, although issued by the Saxon king of a Saxon kingdom, the term used in the laws to define Ine's Germanic subjects is ''Englisc''. This reflects the existence, even at this early date, of a common English identity encompassing all the Germanic peoples of Britain.<ref>Patrick Wormald, "Bede, the ''Bretwaldas'' and the origins of the ''Gens Anglorum''", in Patrick Wormald, ''The Times of Bede - studies in early English Christian society and its historian'' (Oxford 2006), pp. 106-34 at p. 119</ref>

==Christianity==
Ine was a Christian king, who ruled as a patron and protector of the church.  The introduction to his laws names his advisors, among whom are [[Erkenwald|Eorcenwald]], [[Bishop of London]] and [[H<U+00E6>dde]], [[Bishop of Winchester]]; Ine says that the laws were also made with the advice and instruction of "all my ealdormen, and chief councillors of my people, and also a great assembly of the servants of God".<ref name=Eorcenwald /><ref name=Kirby_2>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 2.</ref>  The laws themselves demonstrate Ine's Christian convictions, though the need for a fine for failing to baptise a child or to tithe indicates that some Christian practices had yet to take firm root.<ref name=Blackwell_251 /> Ine supported the church by patronising religious houses, especially in the new [[diocese of Sherborne]],<ref name=Blackwell_251 /> which had been divided from the [[diocese of Winchester]] in 705. Ine had opposed this division, ignoring threats of excommunication from Canterbury, but he agreed to it when Bishop Haedde died.<ref name=Kirby_125/>

The first West Saxon nunneries were founded in Ine's reign by Ine's kinswoman, Bugga, the daughter of King [[Centwine of Wessex|Centwine]], and by Ine's sister Cuthburh, who founded the abbey of [[Wimborne Minster (church)|Wimborne]] at some point after she separated from her husband, King Aldfrith of Northumbria.<ref name=Yorke_139/><ref name=Blackwell_133>Lapidge, Michael (ed.), "Cuthburg", in ''The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 133.</ref>  The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle also records that Ine built a [[Minster (cathedral)|minster]] at [[Glastonbury]]. This must refer to additional building or re-building since there was already a British monastery at Glastonbury.<ref name=Swanton_40_1>Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 40, note 1.</ref>

Ine has been credited with supporting the establishment of an organized church in Wessex, though it is not clear that this was his initiative.  He is also connected with the oldest known West Saxon [[synod]]s, presiding at one himself and apparently addressing the assembled clerics.<ref name=Stenton_71>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 71.</ref>

==Abdication and succession==
In 726, Ine abdicated, with no obvious heir and, according to [[Bede]], left his kingdom to "younger men" in order to travel to [[Rome]], where he died; his predecessor, C<U+00E6>dwalla, had also abdicated to go to Rome.  A trip to Rome was thought to aid one's chance of a welcome in heaven, and according to Bede, many people went to Rome for these reasons: ". . . both noble and simple, layfolk and clergy, men and women alike."<ref name=Bede_PC_276 />  Either Ine or [[Offa of Mercia]] is traditionally supposed to have founded the [[Schola Saxonum]] there, in what is today the Roman [[rione]], or district, of [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]]. The Schola Saxonum took its name from the militias of Saxons who served in Rome, but it eventually developed into a hostelry for English visitors to the city.<ref name=KL_244>Keynes & Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', p. 244.</ref>  Ine's successor was King [[<U+00C6>thelheard of Wessex|<U+00C6>thelheard]]; it is not known whether <U+00C6>thelheard was related to Ine, though some later sources state that <U+00C6>thelheard was Ine's brother-in-law.<ref>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 147. The relationship is recorded in a forged charter: {{cite web | url = http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+250 | title = Anglo-Saxons.net S 250 | accessdate=15 August 2007 }}.</ref>  <U+00C6>thelheard's succession to the throne was disputed by an [[<U+00E6>theling]], Oswald, and it may be that Mercian support for <U+00C6>thelheard in the unsettled aftermath of Ine's abdication both helped establish <U+00C6>thelheard as king and also brought him into the sphere of influence of [[<U+00C6>thelbald of Mercia|<U+00C6>thelbald]], the king of Mercia.<ref name=Swanton_42 /><ref name=Kirby_131>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 131.</ref> His brother Ingild, who died 718, is given as ancestor of king [[Egbert of Wessex]] and the subsequent kings of England.<ref>Garmonsway, G.N. ed., ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', London, J. M. Dent & Sons, Ltd., pp. xxxii,2,4,42,66</ref>
