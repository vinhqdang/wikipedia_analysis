'''Andy Warhol''' ({{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|w|<U+0254>r|h|<U+0252>|l}};<ref>''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]'': "Warhol"</ref> August 6, 1928&nbsp;<U+2013> February 22, 1987) was an American artist who was a leading figure in the [[Art movement|visual art movement]] known as [[pop art]]. His works explore the relationship between artistic expression, celebrity culture and advertisement that flourished by the 1960s. After a successful career as a commercial illustrator, Warhol became a renowned and sometimes controversial artist. [[The Andy Warhol Museum]] in his native city, [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania, holds an extensive permanent collection of art and archives. It is the largest museum in the United States dedicated to a single artist.

Warhol's art encompassed many forms of media, including hand drawing, painting, printmaking, photography, silk screening, sculpture, film, and music. He was also a pioneer in computer-generated art using [[Amiga]] computers that were introduced in 1984, two years before his death. He founded ''[[Interview Magazine]]'' and was the author of numerous books, including ''[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol]]'' and ''[[Popism: The Warhol Sixties]]''. He is also notable as a gay man who lived openly as such before the gay liberation movement. His studio, [[The Factory]], was a famous gathering place that brought together distinguished intellectuals, drag queens, playwrights, [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] street people, Hollywood celebrities, and wealthy patrons.

Warhol has been the subject of numerous retrospective [[art exhibition|exhibitions]], books, and [[I Shot Andy Warhol|feature]] and documentary films. He coined the widely used expression "[[15 minutes of fame]]". Many of his creations are very collectible and highly valuable. The highest price ever paid for a Warhol painting is US$105&nbsp;million for a 1963 canvas titled "[[Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)]]".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/andy-warhol-painting-sells-105m-article-1.1516240 |title=Andy Warhol painting sells for $105M |work=New York Daily News |date= November 13, 2013|accessdate=November 13, 2013}}</ref> A 2009 article in ''The Economist'' described Warhol as the "[[bellwether]] of the art market".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14941229 |title=A special report on the art market: The Pop master's highs and lows |work=The Economist |date= November 26, 2009|accessdate=August 14, 2010}}</ref> Warhol's works include some of the [[List of most expensive paintings|most expensive paintings ever sold]].

In [[third grade]], Warhol had [[Sydenham's chorea]] (also known as St. Vitus' Dance), the nervous system disease that causes involuntary movements of the extremities, which is believed to be a complication of [[Rheumatic fever|scarlet fever]] which causes skin pigmentation blotchiness.<ref name="warhol.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.warhol.org/collection/aboutandy/andyfaq/ |title=biography |publisher=warhol |date= |accessdate=January 13, 2013}}</ref> He became a [[hypochondriac]], developing a fear of hospitals and doctors.

As a teenager, Warhol graduated from [[Schenley High School]] in 1945. After graduating from high school, his intentions were to study [[art education]] at the University of Pittsburgh in the hope of becoming an art teacher, but his plans changed and he enrolled in the [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] in Pittsburgh, where he studied [[commercial art]].<ref>Colacello, Bob (1990), p.19</ref> In 1949, he moved to New York City and began a career in magazine illustration and advertising. In 1949, he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in pictorial design.

==1950s==
During the 1950s, Warhol gained fame for his whimsical ink drawings of shoe advertisements. These were done in a loose, blotted-ink style, and figured in some of his earliest showings at the [[Bodley Gallery]] in New York. With the concurrent rapid expansion of the record industry and the introduction of the vinyl record, Hi-Fi, and stereophonic recordings, [[RCA Records]] hired Warhol, along with another freelance artist, Sid Maurer, to design album covers and promotional materials.<ref>{{Cite book |first1=Andrew |last1=Oldham |authorlink=Andrew Loog Oldham |author2=Simon Spence |author3=Christine Ohlman |title=2Stoned |publisher=[[Secker and Warburg]] |location=London |year=2002 |page=137 |isbn=0-436-28015-9 |oclc=50215773}}</ref>

Warhol was an early adopter of the [[silk screen]] printmaking process as a technique for making paintings. His earliest silkscreening in painting involved hand-drawn images though this soon progressed to the use of photographically derived silkscreening in paintings. Prior to entering the field of fine art, Warhol's commercial art background also involved innovative techniques for image making that were somewhat related to printmaking techniques. When rendering commercial objects for advertising Warhol devised a technique that resulted in a characteristic image. His imagery used in advertising was often executed by means of applying ink to paper and then blotting the ink while still wet. This was akin to a [[printmaking]] process on the most rudimentary scale.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=SC0MCcfRsA8C&pg=PA106&dq=the+role+of+silk+screening+in+pop+art&hl=en&ei=TAm3TrvSIqT50gGi0cnPBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CGAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=blotted%20line%2C%20a%20primitive%20type%20of%20printing%20literally%20%22press%22&f=false ''"The blotted line, a primitive type of printing<U+2014>literally a "press"<U+2014>was, when he devised it, a way for Andy&nbsp;..."; Pop: The Genius of Andy Warhol By Tony Scherman, David Dalton]''</ref>

Warhol's work both as a commercial artist and later a fine artist displays a casual approach to image making, in which chance plays a role and mistakes and unintentional marks are tolerated. The resulting imagery in both Warhol's commercial art and later in his fine art endeavors is often replete with imperfection<U+2014>smudges and smears can often be found. In his book "POPism" Warhol writes, "When you do something exactly wrong, you always turn up something."<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ue1sTYpUbdsC&pg=PA362&lpg=PA362&dq=%22when+you+do+something+exactly+wrong,+you+always+turn+up+something%22&source=bl&ots=NXiyJt2-Y1&sig=Zgy3AvRhfap2wOOjTpIzsR0fc6g&hl=en&ei=tu63Tu6dOsjq2QX2v9TPDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&sqi=2&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22when%20you%20do%20something%20exactly%20wrong%2C%20you%20always%20turn%20up%20something%22&f=false |title=POPism: the Warhol sixties; Andy Warhol, Pat Hackett; p 362 |publisher= |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/33886455/ns/today-entertainment/t/warhols-dollar-bills-painting-fetches-millions/ |title=MSNBC The Arts Warhol's dollar bills painting fetches millions 11/12/2009 |publisher=Today.msnbc.msn.com |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SC0MCcfRsA8C&pg=PA106&dq=the+role+of+silk+screening+in+pop+art&hl=en&ei=TAm3TrvSIqT50gGi0cnPBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CGAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=blotting&f=false |title=Pop: The Genius of Andy Warhol; Tony Scherman, David Dalton; HarperCollins, 2010 |publisher= |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>

Andy Warhol's first New York solo [[pop art]] exhibition was hosted at Eleanor Ward's [[Stable Gallery]] November 6<U+2013>24, 1962. The exhibit included the works ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'', ''100 Soup Cans'', ''100 [[Coke bottle#Contour bottle design|Coke Bottles]],'' and ''100 [[United States one-dollar bill|Dollar Bills]]''. At the [[Stable Gallery]] exhibit, the artist met for the first time poet [[John Giorno]] who would star in Warhol's first film, ''[[Sleep (film)|Sleep]]'', in 1963.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.warholstars.org/warhol/warhol1/warhol1b/johngiorno.html |work=www.warholstars.org |title=John Giorno |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

It was during the 1960s that Warhol began to make paintings of iconic American objects such as dollar bills, [[mushroom cloud]]s, [[electric chair]]s, [[Campbell's Soup Cans]], [[Coca-Cola]] bottles, celebrities such as [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Troy Donahue]], [[Muhammad Ali]], and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], as well as newspaper headlines or photographs of police dogs attacking [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>68)|civil rights]] protesters. During these years, he founded his studio, "[[The Factory]]" and gathered about him a wide range of artists, writers, musicians, and underground celebrities. His work became popular and controversial. Warhol had this to say about Coca Cola:

{{quote|What's great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coca-Cola, Liz Taylor drinks Coca-Cola, and just think, you can drink Coca-Cola, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good.

New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]] hosted a Symposium on pop art in December 1962 during which artists like Warhol were attacked for "capitulating" to consumerism. Critics were scandalized by Warhol's open embrace of market culture. This symposium set the tone for Warhol's reception. Throughout the decade it became increasingly clear that there had been a profound change in the culture of the art world, and that Warhol was at the center of that shift.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

A pivotal event was the 1964 exhibit ''The American Supermarket'', a show held in Paul Bianchini's Upper East Side gallery. The show was presented as a typical U.S. small supermarket environment, except that everything in it<U+2014>from the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc.<U+2014>was created by six prominent pop artists of the time, among them the controversial (and like-minded) [[Billy Apple]], Mary Inman, and [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]]. Warhol's painting of a can of Campbell's soup cost $1,500 while each autographed can sold for $6. The exhibit was one of the first mass events that directly confronted the general public with both pop art and the perennial question of what art is.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}[[File:Warhol-Campbell Soup-1-screenprint-1968.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Campbell's Soup I'' (1968)]]
As an [[Commercial art|advertisement illustrator]] in the 1950s, Warhol used assistants to increase his productivity. Collaboration would remain a defining (and controversial) aspect of his working methods throughout his career; this was particularly true in the 1960s. One of the most important collaborators during this period was [[Gerard Malanga]]. Malanga assisted the artist with the production of silkscreens, films, sculpture, and other works at "[[The Factory]]," Warhol's [[aluminum foil]]-and-silver-paint-lined studio on 47th Street (later moved to Broadway). Other members of Warhol's Factory crowd included [[Freddie Herko]], [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]], [[Ronald Tavel]], [[Mary Woronov]], [[Billy Name]], and [[Brigid Berlin]] (from whom he apparently got the idea to tape-record his phone conversations).<ref>Colacello, Bob (1990), p.67</ref>

During the 1960s, Warhol also groomed a retinue of [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] and [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] eccentrics upon whom he bestowed the designation "[[Warhol Superstar|Superstars]]", including [[Nico]], [[Joe Dallesandro]], [[Edie Sedgwick]], [[Viva (Warhol superstar)|Viva]], [[Isabelle Collin Dufresne|Ultra Violet]], [[Holly Woodlawn]], [[Jackie Curtis]], and [[Candy Darling]]. These people all participated in the Factory films, and some<U+2014>like Berlin<U+2014>remained friends with Warhol until his death. Important figures in the New York underground art/cinema world, such as writer [[John Giorno]] and film-maker [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]], also appear in Warhol films of the 1960s, revealing Warhol's connections to a diverse range of artistic scenes during this time.

===Attempted murder (1968)===
On June 3, 1968, [[radical feminist]] writer [[Valerie Solanas]] shot Warhol and [[Mario Amaya]], art critic and curator, at Warhol's studio.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schaffner |first=Ingrid |authorlink=Ingrid Schaffner |title=The Essential Andy Warhol |publisher=[[Harry N.

Earlier on the day of the attack, Solanas had been turned away from the Factory after asking for the return of a script she had given to Warhol. The script had apparently been misplaced.<ref name="Jobey">Jobey, Liz, "Solanas and Son," ''The Guardian'' (Manchester, England) August 24, 1996: page T10 and following.</ref>

Amaya received only minor injuries and was released from the hospital later the same day. Warhol was seriously wounded by the attack and barely survived: surgeons opened his chest and [[Defibrillation|massaged his heart]] to help stimulate its movement again.

Solanas was arrested the day after the assault. By way of explanation, she said that Warhol "had too much control over my life." She was eventually sentenced to three years under the control of the [[New York City Department of Correction|Department of Corrections]]. After the shooting, the Factory scene became much more tightly controlled, and for many the "Factory 60s" ended.<ref name=popism287-295/>

Warhol had this to say about the attack: "Before I was shot, I always thought that I was more half-there than all-there<U+2014>I always suspected that I was watching TV instead of living life. People sometimes say that the way things happen in movies is unreal, but actually it's the way things happen in life that's unreal.

Compared to the success and scandal of Warhol's work in the 1960s, the 1970s were a much quieter decade, as he became more entrepreneurial. According to [[Bob Colacello]], Warhol devoted much of his time to rounding up new, rich patrons for portrait commissions<U+2014>including Shah of Iran [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], his wife Empress [[Farah Pahlavi]], his sister [[Princess Ashraf Pahlavi]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[John Lennon]], [[Diana Ross]], and [[Brigitte Bardot]].<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8179627.stm |work=BBC News | title=Warhol's Jackson goes on display | date=August 7, 2009 | accessdate=March 30, 2010}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Warhol's famous portrait of Chinese Communist leader [[Mao Zedong]] was created in 1973. He also founded, with [[Gerard Malanga]], ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine, and published ''The Philosophy of Andy Warhol'' (1975).

==1980s==
Warhol had a re-emergence of critical and financial success in the 1980s, partially due to his affiliation and friendships with a number of prolific younger artists, who were dominating the "[[bull market]]" of 1980s New York art: [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Julian Schnabel]], [[David Salle]] and other so-called [[Neo-expressionism|Neo-Expressionists]], as well as members of the [[Transavantgarde]] movement in Europe, including [[Francesco Clemente]] and [[Enzo Cucchi]].

By this period, Warhol was being criticized for becoming merely a "business artist".<ref name = "jpost">{{Cite news|first=Michal |last=Lando |date=April 8, 2008 |title=Reexamining Warhol's Jews |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1207486218796&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |accessdate=January 5, 2009}}</ref> In 1979, reviewers disliked his exhibits of portraits of 1970s personalities and celebrities, calling them superficial, facile and commercial, with no depth or indication of the significance of the subjects. They also criticized his 1980 exhibit of 10 portraits at the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]] in New York, entitled ''Jewish Geniuses'', which Warhol<U+2014>who was uninterested in Judaism and Jews<U+2014>had described in his diary as "They're going to sell."<ref name = "jpost"/> In hindsight, however, some critics have come to view Warhol's superficiality and commerciality as "the most brilliant mirror of our times," contending that "Warhol had captured something irresistible about the [[zeitgeist]] of American culture in the 1970s."<ref name = "jpost"/>

Warhol also had an appreciation for intense [[Hollywood glamour]]. He once said: "I love Los Angeles. I love Hollywood. They're so beautiful. Everything's plastic, but I love plastic. I want to be plastic."<ref>{{Cite book |first1=Victor |last1=Bockris |authorlink=Victor Bockris |author2=[[Gerard Malanga]] |title=Up-tight: the Velvet Underground story |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |location=London |year=2002 |page=66 |isbn=0-7119-9170-7 |oclc=49906101}}</ref>

Warhol died in New York City at 6:32&nbsp;am on February 22, 1987. According to news reports, he had been making good recovery from a routine [[gallbladder]] surgery at [[New York Hospital]] before dying in his sleep from a sudden post-operative [[cardiac arrhythmia]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DA1639F930A25757C0A961948260 |first=Robert O. |last=Boorstin |title=Hospital Asserts it Gave Warhol Adequate Care |date=April 13, 1987 |accessdate=January 2, 2009 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> Prior to his diagnosis and operation, Warhol delayed having his recurring gallbladder problems checked, as he was afraid to enter hospitals and see doctors.<ref name="NYM 1992" /> His family sued the hospital for inadequate care, saying that the arrhythmia was caused by improper care and [[water intoxication]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Sullivan |first=Ronald |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/05/nyregion/care-faulted-in-the-death-of-warhol.html |title=Care faulted in the death of warhol |work=The New York Times |date=December 5, 1991 |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}</ref> The malpractice case was quickly settled out of court; Warhol's family received an undisclosed sum of money.<ref>{{cite news|author=December 24, 1991 |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-12-24/news/9112240841_1_warhol-york-hospital-gallstones |title=Andy Warhol Heirs Settle Lawsuit With Hospital Over Artist's Death - Orlando Sentinel |publisher=Articles.orlandosentinel.com |date=1991-12-24 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>

Warhol's body was taken back to Pittsburgh by his brothers for burial. The wake was at Thomas P. Kunsak Funeral Home and was an open-coffin ceremony. The coffin was a solid bronze casket with gold plated rails and white upholstery. Warhol was dressed in a black cashmere suit, a paisley tie, a platinum wig, and sunglasses. He was posed holding a small prayer book and a red rose. The funeral liturgy was held at the [[Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church (Pittsburgh)|Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church]] on Pittsburgh's [[North Shore (Pittsburgh)|North Side]]. The eulogy was given by Monsignor Peter Tay. [[Yoko Ono]] and [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]] were speakers. The coffin was covered with white roses and [[Asparagus aethiopicus|asparagus ferns]]. After the liturgy, the coffin was driven to [[St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cemetery]] in [[Bethel Park]], a south suburb of Pittsburgh.

At the grave, the priest said a brief prayer and sprinkled holy water on the casket. Before the coffin was lowered, [[Paige Powell]] dropped a copy of ''Interview'' magazine, an ''Interview'' T-shirt, and a bottle of the [[Est<U+00E9>e Lauder Companies|Estee Lauder]] perfume "Beautiful" into the grave. Warhol was buried next to his mother and father. A memorial service was held in Manhattan for Warhol on April 1, 1987, at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York]].

==Foundation==

Warhol's will dictated that his entire estate <U+2014> with the exception of a few modest legacies to family members <U+2014> would go to create a foundation dedicated to the "advancement of the visual arts". Warhol had so many possessions that it took [[Sotheby's]] nine days to auction his estate after his death; the auction grossed more than US$20&nbsp;million.

In 1987, in accordance with Warhol's will, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts began. The foundation serves as the estate of Andy Warhol, but also has a mission "to foster innovative artistic expression and the creative process" and is "focused primarily on supporting work of a challenging and often experimental nature."<ref name="warholfoundation intro">{{cite web|url=http://www.warholfoundation.org/foundation/overview.html|title=Introduction |publisher=The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts |accessdate=January 2, 2009}}</ref>

==Works==

===Paintings===
By the beginning of the 1960s, Warhol had become a very successful commercial illustrator. His detailed and elegant drawings for I. Miller shoes were particularly popular. They consisted mainly of "blotted ink" drawings (or [[monoprint]]s), a technique which he applied in much of his early art. Although many artists of this period worked in commercial art, most did so discreetly. Warhol was so successful, however, that his profile as an illustrator seemed to undermine his efforts to be taken seriously as an artist.

[[Pop art]] was an experimental form that several artists were independently adopting; some of these pioneers, such as [[Roy Lichtenstein]], would later become synonymous with the movement. Warhol, who would become famous as the "Pope of Pop", turned to this new style, where popular subjects could be part of the artist's palette. His early paintings show images taken from [[cartoons]] and advertisements, hand-painted with paint drips. Marilyn Monroe was a pop art painting that Warhol had done and it was very popular. Those drips emulated the style of successful abstract expressionists (such as [[Willem de Kooning]]). Warhol's first pop art paintings were displayed in April 1961, serving as the backdrop for New York Department Store Bronwit Teller's window display. This was the same stage his Pop Art contemporaries [[Jasper Johns]], [[James Rosenquist]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]] had also once graced.<ref>Smith, Patrick S (1986). Andy Warhol's Art and Films. UMI Research Press. p.98. ISBN 0-8357-1733-X.</ref> Eventually, Warhol pared his image vocabulary down to the icon itself<U+2014>to brand names, celebrities, dollar signs<U+2014>and removed all traces of the artist's "hand" in the production of his paintings.

To him, part of defining a niche was defining his subject matter. Cartoons were already being used by Lichtenstein, typography by [[Jasper Johns]], and so on; Warhol wanted a distinguishing subject. His friends suggested he should paint the things he loved the most. It was the gallerist Muriel Latow who came up with the ideas for both the soup cans and Warhol's dollar paintings. On November 23, 1961 Warhol wrote Latow a check for $50 which, according to the 2009 Warhol biography, ''Pop, The Genius of Warhol'', was payment for coming up with the idea of the soup cans as subject matter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warholstars.org/art/warhol/soup.html |title=The Soup Cans<U+2014>Andy Warhol |publisher=Warholstars.org |accessdate=August 14, 2010| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20100801234441/http://www.warholstars.org/art/warhol/soup.html| archivedate= August 1, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
For his first major exhibition Warhol painted his famous cans of Campbell's Soup, which he claimed to have had for lunch for most of his life. The work sold for $10,000 at an auction on November 17, 1971, at Sotheby's New York.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

He loved [[celebrity|celebrities]], so he painted them as well. From these beginnings he developed his later style and subjects. Instead of working on a signature subject matter, as he started out to do, he worked more and more on a signature style, slowly eliminating the handmade from the artistic process. Warhol frequently used [[silk-screen]]ing; his later drawings were traced from slide projections. At the height of his fame as a painter, Warhol had several assistants who produced his silk-screen multiples, following his directions to make different versions and variations.<ref>Colacello, Bob (1990), p.28</ref>

In 1979, Warhol was commissioned by BMW to paint a Group 4 race version of the then elite supercar [[BMW M1]] for the fourth installment in the [[BMW Art Car Project]]. Unlike the three artists before him, Warhol declined the use of a small scale practice model, instead opting to immediately paint directly onto the full scale automobile. It was indicated that Warhol spent only a total of 23 minutes to paint the entire car.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carbodydesign.com/archive/2006/03/27-bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1/bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1.php |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20100213000309/http://www.carbodydesign.com/archive/2006/03/27-bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1/bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1.php |archivedate=February 13, 2010 |title=Bmw Art Car 1979: M1 by Andy Warhol |publisher=carbodydesign.com}}</ref>
Warhol produced both comic and serious works; his subject could be a soup can or an electric chair. Warhol used the same techniques<U+2014>silkscreens, reproduced serially, and often painted with bright colors<U+2014>whether he painted celebrities, everyday objects, or images of suicide, car crashes, and disasters, as in the 1962<U+2013>1963 ''Death and Disaster'' series. The ''Death and Disaster'' paintings included ''Red Car Crash'', ''Purple Jumping Man'', and ''Orange Disaster.'' One of these paintings, the diptych "Silver Car Crash", became the highest priced work of his when it sold at Sotheby's Contemporary Art Auction on Wednesday, November 13, 2013 for $105.4 million.<ref name="sothebys.com">{{cite web |author=Sotheby's - 14 November 2013 |url=http://www.sothebys.com/content/sothebys/en/news-video/blogs/all-blogs/contemporary/2013/11/record-warhol-leads-.html |title=Record Warhol Leads Contemporary Sale &#124; Sotheby's |publisher=Sothebys.com |date=2013-11-14 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>

Some of Warhol's work, as well as his own personality, has been described as being [[Buster Keaton|Keatonesque]]. Warhol has been described as playing dumb to the media. He sometimes refused to explain his work. He has suggested that all one needs to know about his work is "already there 'on the surface.'"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artexpertswebsite.com/pages/artists/warhol.php |title=Andy Warhol Biography (1928-1987) |publisher=Art Experts |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15}}</ref>

His [[Rorschach test|Rorschach inkblots]] are intended as pop comments on art and what art could be. His cow wallpaper (literally, wallpaper with a cow [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]) and his [[redox|oxidation]] paintings (canvases prepared with copper paint that was then oxidized with urine) are also noteworthy in this context. Equally noteworthy is the way these works<U+2014>and their [[means of production]]<U+2014>mirrored the atmosphere at Andy's New York "Factory". Biographer Bob Colacello provides some details on Andy's "piss paintings":

{{quote|Victor&nbsp;... was Andy's ghost pisser on the Oxidations. He would come to the Factory to urinate on canvases that had already been primed with copper-based paint by Andy or Ronnie Cutrone, a second ghost pisser much appreciated by Andy, who said that the vitamin B that Ronnie took made a prettier color when the acid in the urine turned the copper green. Did Andy ever use his own urine? My diary shows that when he first began the series, in December 1977, he did, and there were many others: boys who'd come to lunch and drink too much wine, and find it funny or even flattering to be asked to help Andy 'paint'. Andy always had a little extra bounce in his walk as he led them to his studio.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Bob |last=Colacello |authorlink=Bob Colacello |title=Holy terror: Andy Warhol close up |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |year=1990 |page=343 |isbn=0-06-016419-0 |oclc=21196706}}</ref>}}

Warhol's first portrait of ''Basquiat'' (1982) is a black photosilkscreen over an oxidized copper "piss painting".

After many years of silkscreen, oxidation, photography, etc., Warhol returned to painting with a brush in hand in a series of over 50 large collaborative works done with [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] between 1984 and 1986.<ref>Chiappini, Rudi (ed.) ''Jean-Michel Basquiat''. Museo d'Arte Moderna /Skira, 2005.</ref><ref>Fairbrother, Trevor. "Double Feature<U+2014>Collaborative Paintings, Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat," ''Art in America'', September 1969.</ref> Despite negative criticism when these were first shown, Warhol called some of them "masterpieces," and they were influential for his later work.<ref>Fretz, Eric. ''Jean-Michel Basquiat: A Biography''. Greenwood Press, 2010. ISBN 978-0-313-38056-3.</ref>

The influence of the large collaborations with Basquiat can be seen in Warhol's ''The Last Supper'' cycle, his last and possibly his largest series, seen by some as "arguably his greatest,"<ref name="Dillenberger2001">{{Cite book|first=Jane |last=Dillenberger |title=The Religious Art of Andy Warhol |publisher=Continuum |location=London |year=2001 |pages=10<U+2013>11 |isbn=0-8264-1334-X |oclc=59540326}}</ref> but by others as "wishy-washy, religiose" and "spiritless."<ref>Anthony Haden-Guest, "Warhol's Last Supper" ArtNet 1999, http://www.artnet.com/magazine_pre2000/features/haden-guest/haden-guest8-3-99.asp</ref> It is also the largest series of religious-themed works by any U.S. artist.<ref name="Dillenberger2001"/>

At the time of his death, Warhol was working on ''[[Cars (painting)|Cars]]'', a series of paintings for [[Mercedes-Benz]].<ref name="The Guardian">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2001/sep/01/arts.warhol|title=Warhol: Cars|date=September 1, 2001|accessdate=April 24, 2010|work=The Guardian |location=London | first=Maev | last=Kennedy}}</ref>

A self-portrait by Andy Warhol (1963<U+2013>1964), which sold in New York at the May Post-War and Contemporary evening sale in Christie's, fetched $38.4 million.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

On May 9, 2012, his classic painting "Double Elvis (Ferus Type)" sold at auction at [[Sotheby's]] in New York for US$33 million. With commission, the sale price totaled US$37,042,500, short of the $50 million that Sotheby's had predicted the painting might bring. The piece (silkscreen ink and [[spray paint]] on canvas) shows [[Elvis Presley]] in a [[gunslinger]] pose. It was first exhibited in 1963 at the [[Ferus Gallery]] in [[Los Angeles]]. Warhol made 22 versions of the "Double Elvis," nine of which are held in museums.<ref>{{cite web|last=AP|title=Warhol 'Elvis' sells for $37M; Lichtenstein, Weiwei works break own records at NYC auction|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/warhol-elvis-sells-for-37m-lichtenstein-weiwei-works-break-own-records-at-nyc-auction/2012/05/09/gIQAQQKDEU_story.html|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}</ref>

===Films===
Warhol worked across a wide range of media<U+2014>painting, photography, drawing, and sculpture. In addition, he was a highly prolific filmmaker. Between 1963 and 1968, he made more than 60 films,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0912238/|title=Andy Warhol Filmography|work=The Internet Movie Database|accessdate=September 29, 2009}}</ref> plus some 500 short black-and-white "screen test" portraits of Factory visitors.<ref>Schaffner (1999), p.73</ref> One of his most famous films, ''[[Sleep (film)|Sleep]]'', monitors poet [[John Giorno]] sleeping for six hours. The 35-minute film ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]]'' is one continuous shot of the face of [[DeVeren Bookwalter]] supposedly receiving [[oral sex]] from filmmaker [[Willard Maas]], although the camera never tilts down to see this. Another, ''[[Empire (1964 film)|Empire]]'' (1964), consists of eight hours of footage of the [[Empire State Building]] in New York City at dusk. The film ''[[Eat (film)|Eat]]'' consists of a man eating a mushroom for 45 minutes. Warhol attended the 1962 premiere of the static composition by [[LaMonte Young]] called ''Trio for Strings'' and subsequently created his famous series of static films including ''Kiss'', ''Eat'', and ''Sleep'' (for which Young initially was commissioned to provide music). Uwe Husslein cites filmmaker [[Jonas Mekas]], who accompanied Warhol to the Trio premiere, and who claims Warhol's static films were directly inspired by the performance.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Uwe |last=Husslein |title=Pop goes art: Andy Warhol & Velvet Underground |publisher=Wuppertal |year=1990 |oclc=165575494}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}</ref>

''[[Batman Dracula]]'' is a 1964 film that was produced and directed by Warhol, without the permission of [[DC Comics]]. It was screened only at his art exhibits. A fan of the Batman series, Warhol's movie was an "homage" to the series, and is considered the first appearance of a blatantly [[Camp (style)|campy]] Batman. The film was until recently thought to have been lost, until scenes from the picture were shown at some length in the 2006 documentary ''[[Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis]]''.

Warhol's 1965 film ''[[Vinyl (1965 film)|Vinyl]]'' is an adaptation of [[Anthony Burgess]]' popular [[dystopia]]n novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]''. Others record improvised encounters between Factory regulars such as [[Brigid Berlin]], [[Viva (Warhol Superstar)|Viva]], [[Edie Sedgwick]], [[Candy Darling]], [[Holly Woodlawn]], [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]], [[Nico]], and [[Jackie Curtis]]. Legendary underground artist [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]] appears in the film ''Camp''.

His most popular and critically successful film was ''[[Chelsea Girls]]'' (1966). The film was highly innovative in that it consisted of two [[16 mm film|16 mm]]-films being projected simultaneously, with two different stories being shown in tandem. From the projection booth, the sound would be raised for one film to elucidate that "story" while it was lowered for the other. The multiplication of images evoked Warhol's seminal silk-screen works of the early 1960s.

Other important films include ''[[Bike Boy]]'', ''My Hustler'', ''[[The Nude Restaurant]]'', and ''[[Lonesome Cowboys (1968 film)|Lonesome Cowboys]]'', a raunchy pseudo-[[Western (genre)|western]]. These and other titles document gay underground and camp culture, and continue to feature prominently in scholarship about sexuality and art.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Matthew |last=Tinkcom |title=Working like a homosexual: camp, capital, and cinema |publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |location=Durham, North Carolina |year=2002 |isbn=0-8223-2862-3 |oclc=48098591}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|first=Juan Antonio |last=Su<U+00E1>rez |title=Bike boys, drag queens & superstars: avant-garde, mass culture, and gay identities in the 1960s underground cinema |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |location=Bloomington, Indiana |year=1996 |isbn=0-253-32971-X |oclc=32548890}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}</ref> ''[[Blue Movie]]''<U+2014>a film in which Warhol superstar Viva makes love and fools around in bed with a man for 33 minutes of the film's playing-time<U+2014>was Warhol's last film as director. The film was at the time scandalous for its frank approach to a sexual encounter. For many years Viva refused to allow it to be screened. It was publicly screened in New York in 2005 for the first time in over thirty years.

After his June 3, 1968, shooting, a reclusive Warhol relinquished his personal involvement in filmmaking. His acolyte and assistant director, [[Paul Morrissey]], took over the film-making chores for the [[The Factory|Factory]] collective, steering Warhol-branded cinema towards more mainstream, narrative-based, B-movie [[exploitation film|exploitation]] fare with ''[[Flesh (1968 film)|Flesh]]'', ''[[Trash (1970 film)|Trash]]'', and ''[[Heat (1972 film)|Heat]]''. All of these films, including the later ''[[Blood for Dracula|Andy Warhol's Dracula]]'' and ''[[Flesh for Frankenstein|Andy Warhol's Frankenstein]]'', were far more mainstream than anything Warhol as a director had attempted. These latter "Warhol" films starred [[Joe Dallesandro]]<U+2014>more of a Morrissey star than a true [[Warhol superstar]].

In the early 1970s, most of the films directed by Warhol were pulled out of circulation by Warhol and the people around him who ran his business. After Warhol's death, the films were slowly restored by the Whitney Museum and are occasionally projected at museums and film festivals.

{{Main|Andy Warhol filmography}}

===Music===
In the mid-1960s, Warhol adopted the band [[the Velvet Underground]], making them a crucial element of the [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]] multimedia performance art show. Warhol, with [[Paul Morrissey]], acted as the band's manager, introducing them to [[Nico]] (who would perform with the band at Warhol's request). In 1966 he "produced" their first album ''[[The Velvet Underground & Nico]]'', as well as providing its album art. His actual participation in the album's production amounted to simply paying for the studio time. After the band's first album, Warhol and band leader [[Lou Reed]] started to disagree more about the direction the band should take, and their artistic friendship ended.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In 1989, after Warhol's death, Reed and [[John Cale]] re-united for the first time since 1972 to write, perform, record and release the concept album ''[[Songs for Drella]]'', a tribute to Warhol.

Warhol designed many album covers for various artists starting with the photographic cover of [[John Wallowitch]]'s debut album, ''This Is John Wallowitch!!!'' (1964). He designed the cover art for [[the Rolling Stones]] albums ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971) and ''[[Love You Live]]'' (1977), and the [[John Cale]] albums ''[[The Academy in Peril]]'' (1972) and ''[[Honi Soit (album)|Honi Soit]]'' in 1981. One of Warhol's last works was a portrait of [[Aretha Franklin]] for the cover of her 1986 [[Music recording sales certification|gold album]] ''[[Aretha (1986 album)|Aretha]]'', which was done in the style of the ''Reigning Queens'' series he had completed the year before.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Bego | first = Mark | title = ''Aretha Franklin: The Queen of Soul'' | publisher=Da Capo Press | year = 2001 | page = 250 | isbn = 0-306-80935-4 | oclc = 46488152 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=ErKigdCXUwoC&pg=PA250&lpg=PA250&dq=warhol+album+cover+1986 | accessdate=March 29, 2009}}</ref>

Warhol strongly influenced the [[New Wave music|New Wave]]/[[punk rock]] band [[Devo]], as well as [[David Bowie]]. Bowie recorded a song called "[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]" for his 1971 album ''[[Hunky Dory (album)|Hunky Dory]]''. Lou Reed wrote the song "Andy's Chest", about [[Valerie Solanas]], the woman who shot Warhol, in 1968. He recorded it with the Velvet Underground, and this version was released on the [[VU (album)|VU]] album in 1985. Bowie would later play Warhol in the 1996 movie, ''[[Basquiat (film)|Basquiat]]''. Bowie recalled how meeting Warhol in real life helped him in the role, and recounted his early meetings with him:
{{quote|I met him a couple of times, but we seldom shared more than platitudes. The first time we saw each other an awkward silence fell till he remarked my bright yellow shoes and started talking enthusiastically. He wanted to be very superficial. And seemingly emotionless, indifferent, just like a dead fish. Lou Reed described him most profoundly when he once told me they should bring a doll of Andy on the market: a doll that you wind up and doesn't do anything. But I managed to observe him well, and that was a helping hand for the film ''[Basquiat'']. ... We borrowed his clothes from the museum in Pittsburgh, and they were intact, unwashed. Even the pockets weren't emptied: they contained pancake, white, deadly pale ''{{Explain|fond de teint|foundation}}'' which Andy always smeared on his face, a check torn in pieces, someone's address, lots of homeopathic pills and a wig. Andy always wore those silver wigs, but he never admitted it were wigs. One of his hairdressers has told me lately that he had his wigs regularly cut, like it were real hair. When the wig was trimmed, he put on another next month as if his hair had grown.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.algonet.se/~bassman/articles/95/h.html | title=Can the Real David Bowie Rise, Please? | journal=''[[HUMO]]'' magazine | date=5 December 1995 | accessdate=June 6, 2013}}</ref>}}

===Books and print===
Beginning in the early 1950s, Warhol produced several unbound portfolios of his work.

The first of several bound self-published books by Warhol was ''[[25 Cats Name Sam and One Blue Pussy]]'', printed in 1954 by Seymour Berlin on Arches brand watermarked paper using his blotted line technique for the lithographs. The original edition was limited to 190 numbered, hand colored copies, using Dr. Martin's ink washes. Most of these were given by Warhol as gifts to clients and friends. Copy No. 4, inscribed "Jerry" on the front cover and given to [[Geraldine Stutz]], was used for a facsimile printing in 1987<ref>{{Cite news|first=John |last=Russell |authorlink=John Russell (art critic) |date=December 6, 1987 |title=Art |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DF133DF935A35751C1A961948260 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=January 5, 2009}}</ref> and the original was auctioned in May 2006 for US $35,000 by [[Doyle New York]].<ref>[http://www.doylenewyork.com/default.htm May 3, 2006 auction at Doyle New York]. Retrieved August 14, 2006.</ref>

Other self-published books by Warhol include:
* ''A Gold Book''
* ''Wild Raspberries''
* ''Holy Cats''

After gaining fame, Warhol "wrote" several books that were commercially published:
* ''[[A, a novel|a, A Novel]]'' (1968, ISBN 0-8021-3553-6) is a literal transcription<U+2014>containing spelling errors and phonetically written background noise and mumbling<U+2014>of audio recordings of [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]] and several of Andy Warhol's friends hanging out at the Factory, talking, going out.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* ''[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol|The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B & Back Again)]]'' (1975, ISBN 0-15-671720-4)<U+2014>according to Pat Hackett's introduction to ''The Andy Warhol Diaries'', Pat Hackett did the transcriptions and text for the book based on daily phone conversations, sometimes (when Warhol was traveling) using audio cassettes that Andy Warhol gave her. Said cassettes contained conversations with [[Brigid Berlin]] (also known as Brigid Polk) and former ''Interview'' magazine editor [[Bob Colacello]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* ''[[Popism: The Warhol Sixties]]'' (1980, ISBN 0-15-672960-1), authored by Warhol and Pat Hackett is a retrospective view of the 1960s and the role of pop art.
* ''[[The Andy Warhol Diaries]]'' (1989, ISBN 0-446-39138-7), edited by Pat Hackett, is a diary dictated by Warhol to Hackett in daily phone conversations. Warhol started the diary to keep track of his expenses after being audited, although it soon evolved to include his personal and cultural observations.<ref>Colacello, Bob (1990), p.183</ref>

Warhol created the fashion magazine ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' that is still published today. The loopy title script on the cover is thought to be either his own handwriting or that of his mother, Julia Warhola, who would often do text work for his early commercial pieces.<ref>Colacello, Bob (1990), pp.22<U+2013>23</ref>

===Other media===
Although Andy Warhol is most known for his paintings and films, he authored works in many different media.
* '''Drawing:''' Warhol started his career as a commercial illustrator, producing drawings in "blotted-ink" style for advertisements and magazine articles. Best known of these early works are his drawings of shoes. Some of his personal drawings were self-published in small booklets, such as ''Yum, Yum, Yum'' (about food), ''Ho, Ho, Ho'' (about Christmas) and (of course) ''Shoes, Shoes, Shoes''. His most artistically acclaimed book of drawings is probably ''A Gold Book'', compiled of sensitive drawings of young men. ''A Gold Book'' is so named because of the [[gold leaf]] that decorates its pages.<ref name=Bourdon51>{{Cite book|last=Bourdon |first=David |title=Warhol |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York City |year=1989 |page=51 |isbn=0-8109-1761-0 |oclc=19389231}}</ref> In April 2012 a sketch of 1930s singer Rudy Vallee claimed to have been drawn by Andy Warhol was found at a Las Vegas garage sale. The image was said to have been drawn when Andy was 9 or 10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-17591826 |title='Andy Warhol sketch found' in US garage sale |date=April 2, 2012 |accessdate=April 3, 2012}}</ref> Various authorities have challenged the image's authenticity.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
* '''Sculpture:''' Warhol's most famous sculpture is probably his ''Brillo Boxes'', silkscreened ink on wood replicas of the large, branded cardboard boxes used to hold 24 packages of [[Brillo|Brillo soap pads]]. The original Brillo design was by commercial artist [[James Harvey (artist)|James Harvey]]. Warhol's sculpture was part of a series of "grocery carton" works that also included Heinz ketchup and Campbell's tomato juice cases.<ref name = "365 Takes">{{Cite book|author=Staff of The Andy Warhol Museum |title=Andy Warhol: 365 Takes |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York City |year=2004 |page=35 |isbn=0-500-23814-6 |oclc=56117613}}</ref> Other famous works include the ''Silver Clouds''<U+2014>helium filled, silver mylar, pillow-shaped [[balloon]]s. A ''Silver Cloud'' was included in the traveling exhibition ''Air Art'' (1968<U+2013>1969) curated by [[Willoughby Sharp]]. ''Clouds'' was also adapted by Warhol for [[avant-garde]] choreographer Merce Cunningham's dance piece ''RainForest'' (1968).<ref name=Bourdon231>{{Cite book|last=Bourdon |first=David |title=Warhol |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York City |year=1989 |page=231 |isbn=0-8109-1761-0 |oclc=19389231}}</ref>
* '''Audio:''' At one point Warhol carried a portable recorder with him wherever he went, taping everything everybody said and did. He referred to this device as his "wife". Some of these tapes were the basis for his literary work. Another audio-work of Warhol's was his "Invisible Sculpture", a presentation in which burglar alarms would go off when entering the room. Warhol's cooperation with the musicians of The Velvet Underground was driven by an expressed desire to become a music producer.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* '''Time Capsules:''' In 1973, Warhol began saving ephemera from his daily life<U+2014>correspondence, newspapers, souvenirs, childhood objects, even used plane tickets and food<U+2014>which was sealed in plain cardboard boxes dubbed Time Capsules. By the time of his death, the collection grew to include 600, individually dated "capsules". The boxes are now housed at the Andy Warhol Museum.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Staff of The Andy Warhol Museum |title=Andy Warhol: 365 Takes |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York City |year=2004 |page=157 |isbn=0-500-23814-6 |oclc=56117613}}</ref>
* '''Television:''' Andy Warhol dreamed of a [[television special]] about a favorite subject of his{{dash}}[[Nothing]]{{dash}}that he would call ''The Nothing Special''. Later in his career he did create two cable television shows, ''Andy Warhol's TV'' in 1982 and ''[[Andy Warhol's Fifteen Minutes]]'' (based on his famous "[[fifteen minutes of fame]]" quotation) for MTV in 1986. Besides his own shows he regularly made guest appearances on other programs, including ''[[The Love Boat]]'' wherein a Midwestern wife ([[Marion Ross]]) fears Andy Warhol will reveal to her husband ([[Tom Bosley]], who starred alongside Ross in sitcom ''[[Happy Days]]'') her secret past as a Warhol superstar named Marina del Rey. Warhol also produced a TV commercial for [[Schrafft's]] Restaurants in New York City, for an ice cream dessert appropriately titled the "Underground Sundae".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joedallesandro.com/sundae.htm |title=Underground Sundae |year=2005 |first=Michael |last=Ferguson |accessdate=January 6, 2009| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20090116182237/http://www.joedallesandro.com/sundae.htm| archivedate= January 16, 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
* '''Fashion:''' Warhol is quoted for having said: "I'd rather buy a dress and put it up on the wall, than put a painting, wouldn't you?" <ref>{{cite web|title=Monsters and Critics - Andy Warhol Biography|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/Andy-Warhol/biography/|accessdate=July 28, 2013}}</ref> One of his most well-known Superstars, [[Edie Sedgwick]], aspired to be a fashion designer, and his good friend [[Halston]] was a famous one. Warhol's work in fashion includes silkscreened dresses, a short sub-career as a catwalk-model and books on fashion as well as paintings with fashion (shoes) as a subject.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Warhol himself has been described as a modern [[dandy]], whose authority "rested more on presence than on words".<ref>[[George Walden]], ''Who's a Dandy?<U+2014>Dandyism and Beau Brummell'', Gibson Square, London, 2002.

* '''Performance Art:''' Warhol and his friends staged theatrical multimedia happenings at parties and public venues, combining music, film, slide projections and even Gerard Malanga in an [[Sadomasochism|S&M]] outfit cracking a whip. The [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]] in 1966 was the culmination of this area of his work.<ref name=Bourdon221-225>{{Cite book|last=Bourdon |first=David |title=Warhol |publisher=Harry N.

* '''Theater:''' Andy Warhol's ''Pork'' opened on May 5, 1971 at LaMama theater in New York for a two-week run and was brought to the Roundhouse in London for a longer run in August 1971. ''Pork'' was based on tape-recorded conversations between Brigid Berlin and Andy during which Brigid would play for Andy tapes she had made of phone conversations between herself and her mother, socialite Honey Berlin. The play featured [[Jayne County]] as "Vulva" and [[Cherry Vanilla]] as "Amanda Pork".{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In 1974, Andy Warhol also produced the stage musical [[Man on the Moon (musical)|Man on the Moon]], which was written by [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]] of the [[Mamas and the Papas]].
* '''Photography:''' To produce his silkscreens, Warhol made photographs or had them made by his friends and assistants. These pictures were mostly taken with a specific model of [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] camera that Polaroid kept in production especially for Warhol. This photographic approach to painting and his snapshot method of taking pictures has had a great effect on artistic photography. Warhol was an accomplished photographer, and took an enormous amount of photographs of Factory visitors, friends.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* '''Computer:''' Warhol used [[Amiga]] computers to generate digital art, including [[You Are the One (Andy Warhol)|You Are the One]], which he helped design and build with Amiga, Inc. He also displayed the difference between slow fill and fast fill on live TV with [[Debbie Harry]] as a model.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/PDFs/amiga-ieeespectrum.pdf |title=Amiga: The Computer That Wouldn't Die |year=2001 |accessdate=January 31, 2010}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oqUd8utr14 video])

===Producer and product===
Warhol had assistance in producing his paintings. This is also true of his film-making and commercial enterprises.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

He founded the gossip magazine ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'', a stage for celebrities he "endorsed" and a business staffed by his friends. He collaborated with others on all of his books (some of which were written with Pat Hackett.) He adopted the young painter [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], and the band [[The Velvet Underground]], presenting them to the public as his latest interest, and collaborating with them. One might even say that he produced people (as in the Warholian "Superstar" and the Warholian portrait). He endorsed products, appeared in commercials, and made frequent celebrity guest appearances on television shows and in films (he appeared in everything from ''[[Love Boat]]'' to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and the [[Richard Pryor]] movie, ''Dynamite Chicken'').{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In this respect Warhol was a fan of "Art Business" and "Business Art"<U+2014>he, in fact, wrote about his interest in thinking about art as business in ''The Philosophy of Andy Warhol from A to B and Back Again''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Throughout his career, Warhol produced erotic photography and drawings of male nudes. Many of his most famous works (portraits of [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Judy Garland]], and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], and films like ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]],'' ''My Hustler'' and ''[[Lonesome Cowboys (1968 film)|Lonesome Cowboys]]'') draw from gay underground culture and/or openly explore the complexity of sexuality and desire. As has been addressed by a range of scholars, many of his films premiered in gay porn theaters.<ref>Thomas Waugh, Hard to Imagine: Gay Male eroticism in Photography and Film from the Beginnings to Stonewall, Columbia University Press, New York, N.Y. 1996</ref>

===Religious beliefs===
[[File:WarholLastSup.gif|thumb|300px|Images of Jesus from ''The Last Supper'' cycle (1986). Warhol made almost 100 variations on the theme, which the Guggenheim felt "indicates an almost obsessive investment in the subject matter."<ref>{{cite web|first=Claudia |last=Schmuckli |url=http://pastexhibitions.guggenheim.org/warhol/ |title=Andy Warhol: The Last Supper |publisher=[[Solomon R.

Warhol was a practicing [[Ruthenian Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholic]]. He regularly volunteered at [[homeless shelter]]s in New York, particularly during the busier times of the year, and described himself as a religious person.<ref name=godspy-Warhol>{{Cite journal|first=James |last=Romaine |date=November 12, 2003 |title=Transubstantiating the Culture: Andy Warhol's Secret |url=http://oldarchive.godspy.com/culture/Andy-Warhol-Transubstantiating-the-Culture.cfm.html |journal=[[Godspy]] |accessdate=January 5, 2009}}</ref> Many of Warhol's later works depicted religious subjects, including two series, ''Details of Renaissance Paintings'' (1984) and ''The Last Supper'' (1986). In addition, a body of religious-themed works was found posthumously in his estate.<ref name=godspy-Warhol/>

During his life, Warhol regularly attended [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and the priest at Warhol's church, [[Church of St. Vincent Ferrer (New York)|Saint Vincent Ferrer]], said that the artist went there almost daily,<ref name=godspy-Warhol/> although he was not observed taking communion or going to confession and sat or knelt in the pews at the back.<ref name="Warhol at SVFC"/> The priest thought he was afraid of being recognized; Warhol said he was self-conscious about being seen in a [[Roman Rite]] church [[sign of the Cross|crossing himself]] "in the Orthodox way" (right to left instead of the reverse).<ref name="Warhol at SVFC"/>

His art is noticeably influenced by the eastern Christian tradition which was so evident in his places of worship.<ref name=godspy-Warhol/>

Warhol's brother has described the artist as "really religious, but he didn't want people to know about that because [it was] private". Despite the private nature of his faith, in Warhol's eulogy [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]] depicted it as devout: "To my certain knowledge, he was responsible for at least one conversion. He took considerable pride in financing his nephew's studies for the priesthood".<ref name=godspy-Warhol/>

===Collections===
Warhol was an avid collector. His friends referred to his numerous collections, which filled not only his four-story [[townhouse]], but also a nearby storage unit, as "Andy's Stuff." The true extent of his collections was not discovered until after his death, when the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh took in 641 boxes of his "Stuff."

Warhol's collections included airplane menus, unpaid invoices, pizza dough, pornographic pulp novels, newspapers, stamps, supermarket flyers, and cookie jars, among other eccentricities. One of his main collections was his [[wig]]s. Warhol owned over forty and felt very protective of his hairpieces which were sewn by a New York wig-maker from hair imported from Italy. In 1985 a girl snatched Warhol's wig off his head. It was later discovered in Warhol's diary entry for that day that he wrote "I don't know what held me back from pushing her over the balcony."

Another item found in Warhol's boxes at the museum in Pittsburgh was a [[mummy|mummified]] human foot from [[Ancient Egypt]]. The curator of anthropology at [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]] felt that Warhol most likely found it at a flea market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inktank.fi/the-5-most-unusual-habits-of-andy-warhol/ |title=The 5 most unusual habits of Andy Warhol |publisher=Inktank.fi |date=November 20, 2012 |accessdate=January 13, 2013}}</ref>

Many films by avant-garde cineast [[Jonas Mekas]] have caught the moments of Warhol's life. Sean Gregory Sullivan depicted Warhol in the 1998 film ''[[54 (film)|54]]''. [[Guy Pearce]] portrayed Warhol in the 2007 film, ''[[Factory Girl (film)|Factory Girl]]'', about Edie Sedgwick's life.<ref>Hickenlooper, George (director). ''Factory Girl''</ref> Actor [[Greg Travis]] portrays Warhol in a brief scene from the 2009 film ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]''. In the 2012 film [[Men in Black III]] Andy Warhol turns out to really be undercover MIB Agent W (played by [[Bill Hader]]). Warhol is throwing a party at The Factory in 1969, where he is looked up by MIB Agents K and J (J from the future). Agent W is desperate to end his undercover job ( "I'm so out of ideas I'm painting soup cans and bananas, for Christ sakes!" and "You gotta fake my death, okay? I can't listen to sitar music anymore.")

[[Gus Van Sant]] was planning a version of Warhol's life with [[River Phoenix]] in the lead role just before Phoenix's death in 1993.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Gus Van |last=Sant |authorlink=Gus Van Sant |title=My Own Private Idaho |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |location=London |year=2000 |isbn=0-571-20259-4 |oclc=247737051 |origyear=1987}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}</ref>
