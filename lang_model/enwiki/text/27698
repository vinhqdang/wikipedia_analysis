A '''child bone fracture''' is a medical condition in which a [[bone]] of a child (a person younger than the age of 18) is cracked or broken.<ref>Staheli, Lynn, Practice of Pediatric Orthopedics p. 257</ref> About 15% of all injuries in children are fracture injuries.<ref>Staheli, Lynn, Fundamentals of Pediatric Orthopedics p. 119.</ref> [[Bone fracture]]s in children are different than adult bone fractures because a child<U+2019>s bones are still growing. Also, more consideration needs to be taken when a child fractures a bone since it will affect the child in his or her growth.<ref>Broken Bones in Children

== How fractures occur ==

On an everyday basis bones will support many kinds of forces naturally applied to them, but when the forces are too strong the bones will break. For example, when an adolescent jumps off of a [[trampoline]] and lands on his/her feet the bones and connective tissue in the adolescent<U+2019>s feet will usually absorb the force, flex, then return to their original shape. However, if the adolescent lands and the force is too strong, the bones and the connective tissue will not be able to support the force and will fracture.<ref  name="treat">What Is a Bone Fracture and How Is it Treated? www.kidsgrowth.com.

== Differences between child and adult bones ==

There are differences in the bone structure of a child and an adult. These differences are important for the correct evaluation and treatment of the fractures. A child<U+2019>s bones heal faster than an adult<U+2019>s because a thicker, stronger, and more active dense fibrous membrane ([[periosteum]]) covers the surface of their bones.<ref name="Staheli, Lynn p. 258">Staheli, Lynn, Practice of Pediatric Orthopedics,p. 258.</ref> The periosteum has blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrition to the bone cells. The stronger and thicker periosteum in children causes a better supply of oxygen and nutrients to the bones ,<ref>Hilt, Nancy E, Pediatric Orthopedic Nursing p. 12.

</ref> and this helps in the remodeling of the fractured bones by supplying. The periosteum in children causes a more rapid union of fractured bones and an increased potential for remodeling.<ref name="Staheli, Lynn p. 258" /> A child<U+2019>s fractures not only heal more quickly, but are significantly reduced due to the thickness and strength of a child<U+2019>s periosteum. But this thickness also has its drawbacks; when there is a small displacement in the periosteum the thickness and strength of it will make the fracture in the periosteum difficult to diagnose.<ref name="Staheli, Lynn p. 258"/>

=== Growth plate ===
[[Growth plates]] are the areas in bones where the bones grow.<ref>Staheli, Lynn, Practice of Pediatric Orthopedics p. 260.</ref> In children the growth plates are open, which helps to manage a child<U+2019>s fractures. A child<U+2019>s growth also helps in the remodeling of bones so bone deformities are corrected. The open growth plates in a child<U+2019>s bones help significantly to reduce deformity, but an injured growth plate can also lead to length discrepancies or abnormal bone growth.<ref>My Child Has: Fractures, children hospital.com, Children<U+2019>s Hospital Boston.

</ref>

=== Age and sex related fractures ===
Bone fracture types differ depending on the age and sex of the child. The changes in the bones over time cause variance in the pattern and number of bone fracture injuries. The probability of bone fractures in children increases with age.<ref name="Staheli">Staheli, Lynn, Practice of Pediatric Orthopedics p. 257.</ref> For a small child, injuries will most likely be minimal because the child doesn<U+2019>t have the speed or mass to cause serious injuries.<ref name="Staheli" /> When age increases, so does mass and speed resulting in more serious fractures. The age when girls usually fracture a bone is twelve and for boys the age is fourteen.<ref name="Staheli" /> Also, girls statistically have fewer fractures than boys.  About half of boys and one-fourth of girls are likely to have a fracture during childhood. The [[wrist]] is also the most likely part of the body to be injured. As sport activities increase, the fractures in children increase as well, especially for boys who participate in either [[wrestling]] or [[football]]. Much like bone types in the different stages of childhood are varying, so the bone fracture injuries in infants, children, and adolescents vary. Careful evaluation for the best treatment of each child is needed.<ref name="Staheli" />

== Different types of fractures ==

The bones of a child are more likely to bend than to break completely because they are softer and the periosteum is stronger and thicker.<ref>Broken Bones in Children

</ref> The fractures that are most common in children are the incomplete fractures; these fractures are the greenstick and torus or buckle fractures.

=== Greenstick fracture ===
This fracture involves a bend on one side of the bone and a partial fracture on the other side (like breaking a green stick.)

=== Torus or buckle fracture ===
This fracture occurs at the metaphyseal locations and resemble the torus or base of a pillar in architectural terms. Acute angulation of the cortex is noted, as opposed to the usual curved surface.

== The less common fractures (complete fractures) are ==
=== Closed fracture ===
A fracture that doesn<U+2019>t penetrate the [[skin]].

=== Open (compound) fracture ===
A fracture resulting in the ends of a bone penetrating the skin (these pose an increased risk of infection).
Non-displaced fracture: A fracture where the bone cracks completely and the pieces line up.
Displaced fracture: A fracture where the bone cracks completely in two or more pieces, and the pieces move out of alignment (this type of fracture might require [[surgery]] to make sure the pieces are aligned before casting).

== Other common fractures  ==
=== Hairline fracture ===
An incomplete fracture (a thin crack in the bone that doesn<U+2019>t go all the way through the bone.)

=== Single fracture ===
The bone is fractured only in one place.

=== Segmental fracture ===
Fracture in two or more places in the same bone.

=== Comminuted fracture ===
The bone fractures in more than two places or is crushed into pieces.<ref>Broken Bones, kidshealth.org, Reviewed by: Peter G. Gabos, MD Date reviewed: April 2008. Retrieved Sep. 2008</ref>

=== Corner or bucket-handle fracture===
A ''corner fracture'' or ''bucket-handle fracture'' is fragmentation of the distal end of one or both [[femur]]s, with the loose piece appearing at the bone margins as an osseous density paralleling the metaphysis.<ref name=McGraw-Hill2002>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/bucket+handle+fracture thefreedictionary.com > bucket handle fracture] citing: McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine. <U+00A9> 2002</ref> The term ''bucket-handle fracture'' is used where the loose bone is rather wide at the distal end, making it end in a crescent shape.<ref>[http://www.hawaii.edu/medicine/pediatrics/pemxray/v4c02.html Bucket Handle and Corner Fractures] Radiology Cases in Pediatric Emergency Medicine. Volume 4, Case 2. Rodney B. Boychuk, M.D. Kapiolani Medical Center For Women And Children. University of Hawaii. John A. Burns School of Medicine</ref> These types of fractures are characteristic of [[child abuse]]-related injuries.<ref name=agabegi2nd82>Page 82 in: {{cite book |author=Elizabeth D Agabegi; Agabegi, Steven S. |title=Step-Up to Medicine (Step-Up Series) |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-7153-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

== Symptoms of a bone fracture ==

Even though symptoms vary widely after experiencing a bone fracture, the most common fracture symptoms include:
*[[pain]] in the fractured area
*[[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] in the fractured area
*obvious [[deformity]] in the fractured area
*not being able to use or move the fractured area in a normal manner
*[[bruising]], warmth, or redness in the fractured area<ref name="treat" />

== Children with a higher risk of a fracture ==
=== Low bone mineral content ===
Children with generalized [[Disorder (medicine)|disorder]]s such as [[renal disease]]s, [[cystic fibrosis]], [[diabetes mellitus]], [[growth hormone deficiency]], and [[osteogenesis imperfecta]] disorders are at risk.<ref name="Staheli p274">Staheli, Lynn, Practice of Pediatric Orthopedics p. 274.</ref>
Neuromuscular disorders: children with cerebral palsy, spina bifida, and arthrogryposis, have a higher risk of a fracture because of the combination of joint stiffness and poor mineralization.<ref name="Staheli p274" />

=== Fracture personality ===
Children in general are at greater risk because of their high activity levels. Children that have risk-prone behaviors are at even greater risk.<ref name="Staheli p274" />

== Child abuse ==
Over 2.5 million [[child abuse]] and [[child neglect|neglect]] cases are reported every year, and thirty-five out of every hundred cases are physical abuse cases.<ref name="Staheli p272">Staheli, Lynn, Practice of Pediatric Orthopedics p. 272.</ref> Bone fractures are sometimes part of the [[physical abuse]] of children; knowing the symptoms of bone fractures in physical abuse and recognizing the actual risks in physical abuse will help forward the prevention of future abuse and injuries.<ref name="Staheli p272" /> Astoundingly, these [[abuse]] fractures, if not dealt with correctly, have a potential to lead to the death of the child.<ref name="Staheli p272" />
Fracture patterns in abuse fractures that are very common with abuse are fractures in the growing part of a long bone (between the shaft and the separated part of the bone), fractures of the humeral shaft (long bone between the [[shoulder]] and [[elbow]]), [[ribs]], [[scapula]], outer end of the [[clavicle]], and [[vertebra]]. Multiple fractures of varying age, bilateral fractures, and complex [[skull fracture]]s are also linked to abuse. Fractures of varying ages occur in about thirteen percent of all cases.<ref name="Staheli p272" />

== Treatment ==

When a child experiences a fracture, he or she will have pain and will not be able to easily move the fractured area.<ref name="treat" /> A [[physician|doctor]] or [[emergency care]] should be contacted immediately. In some cases even though the child will not have pain and will still be able to move, medical help must be sought out immediately.<ref name="treat" /> To decrease the pain, bleeding, and movement a physician will put a [[splint]] on the fractured area. Treatment for a fracture follows a simple rule: the bones have to be aligned correctly and prevented from moving out of place until the bones are healed.<ref name="treat" /> The specific treatment applied depends on how severe the fracture is, if it<U+2019>s an open or closed fracture, and the specific bone involved in the fracture (a hip fracture is treated differently than a forearm fracture for example)<ref name="treat" />
Different treatments for different fractures:<ref name="treat" />	
The general treatments for common fractures are as follows:

=== Cast immobilization ===
Because most fractures heal successfully after having been repositioned, a simple plaster or fiberglass [[Orthopedic cast|cast]] is commonly used.<ref name="treat" />

=== Functional cast or brace ===
A cast, or brace, that allows limited movement of the nearby [[joint]]s is acceptable for some fractures.<ref name="treat" />

=== Traction ===
This treatment consists of aligning a bone or bones by a gentle, steady pulling action. The pulling may be transmitted to the bone or bones by a metal pin through a bone or by skin tapes. This is a preliminary treatment used in preparation for other secondary treatments.<ref name="treat" />

=== Open reduction and internal fixation ===
This treatment is only used when an orthopedic surgeon assigns it to restore the fractured bone to its original function. This method positions the bones to their exact location, but there is a risk for infection and other complications. The procedure involves the orthopedist performing surgery on the bone to align the bone fragments, followed by the placement of special screws or metal plates to the outer surface of the bone. The fragments can also be held together by running metal rods through the [[Bone marrow|marrow]] in the center of the bone.<ref name="treat" />

=== External fixation ===
This treatment also requires surgery by an [[orthopedist]]. Pins or screws are placed into the fractured bone above and below the fracture site. The [[orthopedic surgeon]] repositions the bone fragments and pins or screws are connected to a metal bar or bars outside the skin which holds the bones in their proper position so they can heal. The external fixation device is removed after an appropriate time period.<ref name="treat" />

===Medication ===
This is for the pain.<ref name="treat" />
