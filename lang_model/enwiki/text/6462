'''''Sesame Street''''' is an [[Television in the United States|American]] educational [[children's television series]] for [[nursery school|preschoolers]] and is a pioneer of the contemporary educational television standard, combining both [[edutainment|education and entertainment]]. ''Sesame Street'' is well known for its [[The Muppets|Muppet]] characters, created by the [[puppeteer]] [[Jim Henson]]. More than 4,134 episodes of the show<ref>The first season included 130 episodes, but season 36 only had 25.</ref> have been produced in 36 seasons, which makes it one of the [[List of longest running U.S. television series|longest-running]] television shows in [[History of television|history]].

''Sesame Street'' is produced in the United States by non-profit organization [[Sesame Workshop]], formerly known as the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), founded by [[Joan Ganz Cooney]] and [[Ralph Rogers]]. It premiered on [[November 10|November 10th]], [[1969 in television|1969]], on the [[National Educational Television]] network, and later that year it was moved to NET's replacement, the [[Public Broadcasting Service]].

With its positive influence, ''Sesame Street'' is the most highly regarded educational show for children in the world.<ref>Karen Barss ''et al.'', "[http://enhancinged.wgbh.org/kids/cases/sesame/ Enhancing Education: A Children's Producer's Guide: Sesame Street: Case Study]", Corporation for Public Broadcasting (accessed [[June 29]] [[2005]])</ref> No television series has matched its level of international recognition and success.

==Overview==
Sesame Street uses a combination of [[puppet]]s, animation, and live actors to teach young children letter and word recognition, mathematics (numbers, addition and subtraction), as well as geometric forms, and classification. Since the show's inception, other instructional goals have been basic life skills, such as how to cross the street safely, proper hygiene, healthy eating habits, and social skills.

The show displays a subtle sense of humour that has appealed to older viewers since it first premiered; this was devised as a means to encourage parents and older siblings to watch the series with younger children, thus becoming involved in the learning process, rather than having ''Sesame Street'' act as a babysitter. A number of parodies of popular culture appear, especially ones aimed at the [[Public Broadcasting Service]], the network that broadcasts the show. For example, the recurring segment [[Monsterpiece Theatre]] once ran a sketch called "Me Claudius". Children viewing the show might enjoy watching [[Cookie Monster]] and [[the Muppets]], while adults watching the same sequence may enjoy the spoof of the ''[[Masterpiece Theatre]]'' showing of ''[[I, Claudius (TV series)|I, Claudius]]'' on PBS.
[[Image:Tv_sesame_street_grover_and_a_boy.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Some of the show's most authentic and memorable moments were unscripted conversations between Muppets, such as [[Grover]] (above) or [[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]], and real children.]]
Several of the character names used on the program are puns or cultural references aimed at a slightly older audience, including Flo Bear ([[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]]), [[Sherlock Hemlock]] (a [[Sherlock Holmes]] parody), H. Ross Parrot (based on Reform Party founder [[H. Ross Perot]]), Dr. Feel based on [[Dr. Phil]], Polly Darton ([[Dolly Parton]]), and a [[Jack Bauer]] Muppet in a parody of ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]''. Over two hundred notable personalities have made guest appearances on the show, beginning with [[Carol Burnett]] on the first episode, and ranging from performers like [[James Brown]] and [[Johnny Cash]], to political figures such as [[Laura Bush]] and [[Kofi Annan]].<ref name=washingtonfile1>Michael Jay Friedman, [http://usinfo.state.gov/xarchives/display.html?p=washfile-english&y=2006&m=April&x=20060405165756jmnamdeirf0.4207117 Washington File: Honored children's show popular throughout the world], [[8 April]] [[2006]]. Annan was actually on his way to Norway to accept the 2001 [[Nobel Peace Prize]].</ref> By making a show that not only educates and entertains kids, but also keeps parents entertained and involved in the educational process, the producers hope to inspire discussion about the concepts on the show.

In 1999, the series became the longest running American children's program, taking the title from ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]''. The British series ''[[Blue Peter]]'' still retains the worldwide record.<ref>Note that ''[[Bozo's Circus]]'' and ''[[The Magic Window]]'' were produced longer than ''Sesame Street'', but both ran only in local markets, while ''Sesame Street'' is national.</ref> The series has made many published lists, including greatest all-time show compilations by ''[[TV Guide]]'' and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. Nielsen Media Research has found that 99% of American preschoolers recognise the series' characters.<ref name="sslpress">''Sesame Street Live'' Press Kit, Minneapolis MN: Vee Corporation, 2004.</ref> Another study** found that 81% of kids under the age of six own a ''Sesame Street'' toy or game, and 87% own a book based on the series.<ref name="sslpress">''Sesame Street Live'' Press Kit, Minneapolis MN: Vee Corporation, 2004.</ref>

The series' music has appeared on music charts around the world, including Ernie's "Rubber Duckie" song, which made #16 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart in 1970; the song achieved an even higher position in Germany. In 1992, British band [[Smart E's]] released ''Sesame's Treet'', a [[Techno music|techno]] dance track which sampled the "classic" version of the ''Sesame Street'' theme. It reached #2 on the [[UK Singles Chart|UK singles chart]].<ref>David Roberts (Managing Editor) ''et al.'', ''Guinness World Records: British Hit Singles & Albums'' (Eighteenth Edition), 2005, ISBN 1-904994-00-8</ref> Sesame Street has won 11** Grammy Awards, most recently for 2001 release ''Elmo and the Orchestra''.

==History of the show==

:''Main article: [[History of Sesame Street]]''
The show's original format called for the humans to be intermixed with the segments of animation, live-action shorts and [[The Muppets|Muppet]]s. These segments were created to be like commercials &mdash; quick, catchy and memorable &mdash; and made the learning experience much more like fun. The format became a model for what is known today as [[edutainment]]-based programming.

CTW aired the program for test groups to determine if the revolutionary new format was likely to succeed. Results showed that test watchers were entranced when the ad-like segments aired, especially those with the jovial puppets, but were remarkably less interested in the street scenes. Psychologists warned CTW against a mixture of fantasy and reality elements, but producers soon decided to mix the elements. A simple dose of cartoon-like characters lets the humans deliver messages without causing viewers to lose interest.<ref name=unpaved>David Borgenicht, ''[[Sesame Street Unpaved]]''. Hyperion, 1998.</ref>

''Sesame Street'', along with several other [[Sesame Workshop]] &ndash; produced shows (such as ''[[The Electric Company]]'', which was produced when Sesame Workshop was still CTW) are all taped in [[New York City]]. Originally they were taped at the [[Teletape Studios]] at 81st and Broadway in Manhattan, but the bankruptcy of Teletape's parent company, Reeves Entertainment, forced these productions to move to [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] in neighboring [[Queens]].

The brownstone architecture of ''Sesame Street'', a fictional [[neighborhood]] in [[New York City]], as well as the concept of neighbors from different backgrounds living in the same area and sharing their life experiences, was loosely based on Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn - where several of the founding producers were living at the time.

==Broadcast history==
The show is broadcast worldwide; in addition to the U.S. version, many countries have locally-produced versions adapted to local needs, some with their own characters, and in a variety of different languages. In [[Television in Canada|Canada]], beginning in 1970, 15-minute shows called ''Canada's Sesame Street'' were broadcast, and by 1972 an edited version of the one-hour American program was airing but with specially filmed Canadian segments, which featured the [[French language]]. In 1995 the American version was replaced by a half-hour long all-Canadian version of the series entitled ''[[Sesame Park]]''. Since the original ''Sesame Street'' was still accessible to Canadians, and more familiar, the format change didn't find acceptance with audiences and was taken off the air in 2002. Broadcasts in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] began in 1971. In the [[United Kingdom]], the show was first broadcast by various [[ITV]] regions in the early 1970s, after which it moved to [[Channel 4]], where it was a lunch-time fixture for many years through to the early 2000s. Later broadcasts of the show featured the hour-long episodes in a format of two half-hour episodes. 120 countries have aired the show, many of which partnered with Sesame Workshop to create local versions.

In recent years ''Sesame Street'' has made what area educators consider to be critical advances in its international versions. In the late 1990s versions appeared in [[China]] and [[Russia]] as these countries shifted away from communism. There is also a joint [[Israel]]i-[[Palestinian]]-[[Jordan]]ian project, called ''Sesame Stories'', which was created with the goal of promoting greater cultural understanding.

The show has also spawned the spin-off series ''[[Play with Me Sesame]]'', [[ESL]] program ''[[Sesame English]]'', the "classics" show ''[[Sesame Street Unpaved]]'', and the segment-only series ''[[Open Sesame]]''. ''[[Elmo's World]]'' and ''[[Global Grover]]'', both of which are segments of ''Sesame Street'', have been distributed as individual series. Jennifer Monier-Williams, Vice President, Worldwide Television Distribution at Sesame Workshop commented "The expansion of the ''Sesame'' brand through wonderfully interactive shows like ''Play With Me Sesame'' and ''Elmo's World'' give children around the globe new ways to experience fun and learning in the way Sesame does it best."<ref>"[http://www.sesameworkshop.org/aboutus/inside_press.php?contentId=16743118 Sesame Workshop expands opportunities for kids to play with their ''Sesame Street'' friends]", Sesame Workshop press release, 21 August 2006.</ref>

===Funding===
[[Image:Nader-sesame01.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Public advocate [[Ralph Nader]] has criticised PBS for allowing [[McDonald's]] and [[Laser Quest]] as sponsors, as they can be linked to [[childhood obesity]] and [[violence]], respectively. In general he dislikes corporate sponsorships, as "'Sesame Street' is not Main Street." He had appeared on the show in the 1988 special ''[[The Sesame Street Special]]'', with the character Bob, singing "[[People in Your Neighborhood]]".]]

Funding for season 37 of ''Sesame Street'' is provided by a [[Ready To Learn]] grant in partnership with the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], the [[McDonald's Corporation]], [[Beaches Family Resorts]], [[Pampers]] and EverydayKidz.com from [[Astra Zeneca]]. Major funding for ''Sesame Street'' is provided by [[The Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] (did not fund from 1972-1992, and from 1998-2000) and by contributions to your PBS stations from "[[Viewers Like You]]." Previous donors of funding for ''Sesame Street'' included [[Chuck E. Cheese's]], the [[Ford Foundation]], [[Discovery Zone]], [[AOL]] (2002), [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]], and the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]]. 

Occasionally local businesses and organizations fund local telecasts of ''Sesame Street'' on PBS stations throughout the U.S. For example, the [[W. M. Keck Foundation]] underwrites the broadcast of Sesame Street on [[KCET]] in Los Angeles.

Within the context of the show, and before the actual underwriting announcements, it is announced that "Sesame Street is brought to you by" the letters and numbers of the day, as though they too were sponsors.

===Ratings===
As a result of its success in revolutionizing the standards of children's television, ''Sesame Street'' inadvertently diminished its own audience share. According to PBS Research, the show went from a 2.0 average on [[Nielsen Media Research]]'s "people meters" in 1995&ndash;96 to a 1.3 average in 2000&ndash;01. Even with this decrease, ''Sesame Street'''s viewership in an average week came from roughly 5.6 million households with 7.5 million viewers. This placed ''Sesame'' at 8th place in the overall kids' charts, as of 2002. The program fares better among mothers age 18&ndash;49 who had children under the age of 3, taking second place.

A format change helped the show's ratings, boosting them up 31% in February 2002 among children age 2&ndash;5, in comparison to its ratings in 2001. As of 2005, ''Sesame Street'' and three other PBS shows are in the top 10 shows for children ages 2 to 5.<ref>http://www.azcentral.com/families/articles/1018pbscharacter1019.html</ref> As of season 36 in 2005, there were 8 million viewers daily.<ref name="presskit">[http://www.sesameworkshop.org/aboutus/pressroom/presskits/season37/sesame_street.php Sesame Workshop: Sesame Street Season 37 Press Kit]</ref>

Also [[List of Sesame Street characters, by order of debut|Characters ordered by date of debut]], [[List of Sesame Street characters by last known appearance|Characters ordered by last known appearance]]''

''Sesame Street'' is known for its [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] element and is inclusive in its casting, incorporating roles for disabled people, young people, senior citizens, Hispanic actors, Black actors, and others. While some of the puppets look like people, others are animal or "monster" puppets of different sizes and colors. This encourages children to believe that people come in all different shapes, sizes, and colors, and that no particular physical "type" is any better than another. Jim Henson commented that "The only kids who can identify along racial lines with the Muppets have to be either green or orange."<ref name=all>Phylis Feinstein, ''All About Sesame Street''. 1970."</ref>

In harmony with its multiculturalist perspective, the show pioneered the idea of occasionally inserting very basic Spanish words and phrases to help young children become acquainted with the concept of a foreign language, doing so almost three decades before [[Dora the Explorer]] made her debut on [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]]. Perhaps in response to the popularity of Dora, the recently revamped format gives [[Rosita, la Monstrua de las Cuevas|Rosita]], the bilingual muppet who "emigrated" in 1993 from the Mexican version of the show, more time in front of viewers, and also introduced the more formalized "Spanish Word of the Day" in every episode.

Each of the puppet characters has been designed to represent a specific stage or element of early childhood, and the scripts are written so that the character reflects the development level of children of that age. This helps the show address not only the learning objectives of various age groups, but also the concerns, fears, and interests of children of different age levels.

===The Muppets===
[[Big Bird]] is an 8-foot&nbsp;2-inch-tall yellow [[canary]] who lives in a large nest on an abandoned lot which is located behind 123 Sesame Street's garbage heap. Big Bird is often visited by his friend [[Aloysius Snuffleupagus]], who is a very large, brown woolly elephant-like creature and is known more popularly by his nickname "Snuffy". Various other Snuffleupaguses<!--this spelling is correct within SS--> have appeared on the show from time to time, most notably Snuffy's little sister Alice and his unnamed mother. Initially, Snuffy showed up when no one but Big Bird was around, leaving the rest of the neighborhood to think he was imaginary. In the mid-1980s, however, Snuffy was revealed to be "real" and incorporated into the regular cast of the show.

[[Oscar the Grouch]], who loves trash, lives with his pet worm [[Slimey the Worm|Slimey]] and his pet elephant [[List of Sesame Street characters|Fluffy]] in a garbage can in the heap. [[Bert and Ernie]], two of the most-recognized Muppets, are friends who room together in the basement apartment of 123 Sesame Street, and regularly engage in comic routines which showcase their odd-couple personalities. Ernie's flowerbox was once a hotspot for [[Twiddlebugs]], a colorful family of insects.

[[The Bear family]], which resembles the bears of ''[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]'', resides in ''Sesame Street''. This family, headed by [[Papa Bear (Sesame Street)|Papa Bear]] and [[Mama Bear (Sesame Street)|Mama Bear]], welcomed their second child [[Curly Bear (Sesame Street)|Curly Bear]], and [[Baby Bear (Sesame Street)|Baby Bear]] became a good friend of the monsters [[Telly Monster|Telly]] and [[Zoe (Sesame Street)|Zoe]], Mexico-born [[Rosita, la Monstrua de las Cuevas|Rosita]], and the furry, red preschooler [[Elmo]]. Elmo has his own segment near the end of each episode, in which viewers explore topics in ''[[Elmo's World]]'', an imaginary version of his house. New to ''Sesame Street'' is [[Abby Cadabby]], a [[fairy]]-in-training who attends Storybook Community School with Baby Bear.

[[Grover]]'s regular segment, ''[[Global Grover]]'', follows the self-described "cute, furry monster" around the world as he explores local cultures and traditions. Grover has had several notable roles over the years, often as a waiter or a superhero (Super-Grover). [[Cookie Monster]] fights with his conscience daily during [[Letter of the Day]], as he tries to control his urges to eat the letters, shown as icing on cookies. [[Prairie Dawn]] often attempts to help Cookie Monster refrain from eating the letters, but never succeeds and always leaves frazzled. [[Count von Count]] has fewer problems during the [[Number of the Day]] segment, where he indulges in counting until the mystery number is revealed by his pipe organ.

[[Humphrey and Ingrid]] are a married couple who have a baby named [[Natasha (Sesame Street)|Natasha]], and they are the proprietors of the hotel known as ''[[The Furry Arms]]'', which is located near the Sesame Street Subway station. The hotel's bellhop, [[Benny Rabbit]], tends to be easily irritated, but begrudgingly helps out.

[[Kermit the Frog]] hosted the segment ''[[Sesame Street News Flash]]''. In other segments, Kermit would play [[Double act|straight man]] to the wacky antics of other Muppets. The [[Two-Headed Monster]] sounded out words coming together, and the [[Yip-Yips|Yip-Yip]] aliens discovered telephones and typewriters. For two seasons, [[List of Sesame Street characters#G|Googel]], [[List of Sesame Street characters#N|Narf]], [[List of Sesame Street characters#M|Mel]] and [[List of Sesame Street characters#P|Phoebe]] hung out in the ''[[Monster's Clubhouse]]''.

Incidental characters include television personality [[Guy Smiley]], construction workers [[Sully and Biff]], the large [[Herry Monster]] (who does not know his own strength), and [[The Big Bad Wolf]], who is not a terror to the Street. [[Forgetful Jones]], a cowboy with a short-term memory disorder, rode his trusty Buster the Horse with his girlfriend Clementine, and [[Rodeo Rosie]] was an early cowgirl.

===The humans===
[[Image:Bob with Sesame Street sign.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Characters on the show, like Bob, have great longevity compared to like series. This still is from the closing sequence of an early season. Linda was television's longest appearing character with a [[disability]], while Luis is the longest running [[Hispanic]] character.<ref name=washingtonfile2>Michael Jay Friedman, [http://usinfo.state.gov/xarchives/display.html?p=washfile-english&y=2006&m=April&x=20060405165756jmnamdeirf0.4207117 Washington File: Honored children's show popular throughout the world], [[8 April]] [[2006]].</ref> Gordon and Susan may hold such an honor for longest running African-American characters.]]
:''Main article: [[Human characters on Sesame Street]]''

A slate of human regulars pull the zaniness of the Muppets back to reality. They were not always meant to serve this purpose. The show lost test viewers' attention during the Street Scenes, meaning Muppets needed to be added, to hide the fact it was educational.

Music teacher Bob has been on ''Sesame Street'' since its inception. He dated [[Linda Bove|Linda]] the local [[New York Library]] librarian, who was the first regular deaf character on television. Linda owns [[Barkley]], a Muppet dog. [[The Robinson family]] are an African-American family that includes schoolteacher Gordon, nurse Susan, and adopted son Miles. The Puerto Rican Rodriguez Family include Maria and Luis, who ran the [[Fix-It Shop]], which was turned into the [[Mail-It Shop]]; Maria gave birth to daughter Gabby in 1986, and her [[pregnancy]] was covered on the show.

General store and restaurant operator Harold Hooper, played by actor [[Will Lee]], was a mainstay at [[Mr. Hooper's Store]]. When Lee died in 1982, the producers opted to help their young viewers deal with the death of someone they loved rather than cast a new actor in the role, and the character's death was discussed in a landmark 1983 episode.<ref>While Mr. Hooper's death is considered by most as a landmark in children's television, this wasn't the first death in a children's program. Upon the 1973 death of [[George Woodbridge]], who played the titular character in the British series ''[[Inigo Pipkin]]'', the third season of the show dealt with the character's passing. The series was renamed ''Pipkins'', to reflect the change in cast.</ref> Afterwards, Hooper's apprentice David took over, followed by later owners Gina, Mr. Handford, and Alan. Gina stopped running the store in the 1990s, to earn a PhD and became a veterinarian.

[[Mr. Noodle]] and his brother and sister, who appear only in ''[[Elmo's World]]'' are meant to provide a vaudevillian perspective on subjects, contrary to most of the show's current human characters (though reminiscent of such earlier insert characters as Buddy and Jim, Larry and Phyllis, and The Mad Painter).<ref>[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Character_Pairs Muppet Wiki: Character Pairs]</ref>

[[List of celebrity guest stars on Sesame Street|Famous guest stars]]<ref>''Sesame Street'' even turned to relative star-wattage for its theme song, "(Can you tell me how to get, how to get to) Sesame Street". Harmonica legend [[Toots Thielemans]] wrote the song in 1969, and played a harmonica solo in some versions of the sequence.</ref> and various children from New York schools and day-care centers are a constantly changing part of the cast, including children who would later become celebrities, like actor [[Tyler James Williams]], and rapper [[GM Grimm]].

==Cast and crew==
Over the 37 seasons of ''Sesame Street'' hundreds, if not thousands, of people have worked on the show's cast and in their crew, producing Street scenes or segments, or working behind the scenes.

Some countries have co-produced their own unique versions of ''Sesame Street'', in which the characters and segments represent their country's cultures. Other countries simply air a dubbed version of ''Sesame Street'', or a dubbed version of ''[[Open Sesame]]''. Among various other countries, Australia has and still does broadcast the American version on the ABC and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] had broadcast the American show, on [[Channel 4]] until 2001 when it was replaced with Henson production ''[[The Hoobs]]''.

Dubbed versions include ''Seesamtie'' in Finnish, ''Boneka Sesame'' in Indonesian, ''Sesam Opnist <U+00DE><U+00FA>'' in Icelandic, ''Sesamo Apriti'' in Italian, ''Sezame, otev<U+0159>i se'' in Czech, and Malay ''Taman Sesame''. In 2004, one Japanese network cancelled the dubbed American ''Sesame'', while another created a local version. In [[New Zealand]], locally produced segments entitled "Korero [[M<U+0101>ori]]" (in English: "let's speak M<U+0101>ori") were inserted into episodes to educate children in the [[M<U+0101>ori language]]. Spanish program ''[[La Cometa Blanca]]'' also includes segments from ''Sesame Street''.

[[Image:Tv_Sesame_Street_Telly_Monster_and_a_triangle.jpg|right|200px|thumb|''Sesame Street'' was one of the first kids television series devoted to promoting the arts.

''Sesame Street'' has operated with a rigorous research standard since its foundation, to ensure that programming  addresses its viewers' needs. The Education and Research (E&R) department of Sesame Workshop is currently headed by [[Rosemarie Truglio|Rosemarie T. Truglio]], Ph. D. and [[Jeanette Betancourt]], Ed. D. Truglio states that the level of interaction between E&R, Content, and Production is "[i]ntimately<U+00B7>hand-in-hand. They are not creating anything without our knowledge, our guidance and our review. We are involved in content development across all media platforms."<ref name="Q&A">[http://www.sesameworkshop.org/press_kit/pdf/Q_&_A_Susan_and_Rosemarie.pdf Seaseme workshop question and answer page.]</ref> This close-knit organizational structure has been an integral part of Sesame Workshop since it began.

Writers create plots for ''Sesame Street'' scenes and segments, and the content is reviewed by the E&R team, which has authority to reject a script and force rewrites if the content is not acceptable. When a script is factually correct, but includes gray areas that may not be comprehensible to children, the writers and E&R work together to tweak everything. "A balance between content and humor"<ref name="Q&A">[http://www.sesameworkshop.org/press_kit/pdf/Q_&_A_Susan_and_Rosemarie.pdf]</ref> is always pursued, according to Truglio.

In a national study of American mothers with children under age six, 64% responded that they strongly believe ''Sesame Street'' is a leader and innovator in educational methods.<ref name="sslpress">''Sesame Street Live'' Press Kit, Minneapolis MN: Vee Corporation, 2004.</ref>

Since 1998 Sesame Workshop has provided a great deal of content on its website<ref>[http://www.sesameworkshop.org/parents/ Sesame Workshop Parents]</ref> and others such as [[Random House]].<ref>[http://www.randomhouse.com/kids/sesamebeginnings/intro.html Random House: Introduction to Sesame Beginnings]</ref> The content is targeted at parents and children ranging in age from birth to school-age, and includes information on dozens of topics, such as appropriate parenting techniques, dealing with children's fears, development of literacy, and maintenance of good health.

Research is funded by government grants, corporate and private donations (including, recently, The Prudential Foundation for the Sesame Beginnings program), and the profits gained from the sale of Sesame Workshop merchandise.

===Healthy Habits for Life===
In 2005, ''Sesame Street'' launched its [[Healthy Habits for Life]] programming, to encourage young viewers to lead more active and nutritious lifestyles. A major catalyst for this was data published by the US [[Centers for Disease Control]] regarding [[obesity]] in children.

Health content has existed on ''Sesame Street'' for years, but to a limited extent. In one instance press kits for a project were made available, news wires latched onto the story, and literally hundreds of newspapers reported that [[Cookie Monster]] was "going on a diet". In actuality there was no change to Cookie Monster's character. The new season featured a new segment with rapper [[Wyclef Jean]] singing the praises of fruits and vegetables, similar to segments in the 1990s which featured Cookie doing nearly the same.

According to people from Sesame Workshop, {{cquote|Health has always been a part of our Sesame Street curriculum, therefore we will always be committed to ensuring kids are given information and messages that will help them become healthy and happy in their development. For season 36, we have turned up the dial in health, but it will always be part of our curriculum.<ref>[http://www.sesameworkshop.org/press_kit/qa.php Sesame Workshop Season 36 Press Kit], accessed [[28 June]] [[2006]].</ref>}}

The Workshop formed an Advisory Board consisting of experts such as [[Woodie Kessel]], M.D., M.P.H., the Assistant [[Surgeon General of the United States]]. This board examines the research of other organizations, and also conducts pilot studies to determine which areas of research should be expanded, based on social, ethnic and socio-economic sections of the population.

Characters Elmo and Rosita filmed [[public service announcement]]s with various U.S. Governors in 2006.<ref>[http://www.sesameworkshop.org/aboutus/inside_press.php?contentId=16198798 United States Governors Join Sesame Street's Elmo and Rosita to Encourage Healthy Habits in Children], [[April 24]] [[2006]]; Governors Mike Huckabee (R-AR), Frank Murkowski (R-AK), Felix Perez Camacho (R-GU), Dirk Kempthorne (R-ID), Kathleen Sebelius (D-KS), Kathleen Blanco (D-LA), Jennifer Granholm (D-MI), Kenny Guinn (R-NV), John Hoeven (R-ND), Ancibal Acevendo-Vila (D-PR), Bob Taft (R-OH), Don Carcieri (R-RI) with his wife, Sue Carcieri, Jon Huntsman (R-UT), Jim Douglas (R-VT) and Joe Manchin III (D-WV).</ref>

==Merchandising and endorsement==

Over the course of the show, many hundreds of Muppet skits have been accumulated, allowing the Workshop to release full-length collections of skits, like the aforementioned.]]
''Sesame Street'' is known for its extensive merchandising, which includes many books, magazines, video/audio media, and toys. A percentage of the money from any Sesame Workshop product goes to help fund ''Sesame Street'' or its international co-productions.<ref name="presskit">[http://www.sesameworkshop.org/aboutus/pressroom/presskits/season37/sesame_street.php Sesame Workshop: Sesame Street Season 37 Press Kit]</ref>

Current licensors include [[Fisher-Price]], [[Nakajima USA]], [[Build-A-Bear Workshop]] (Build-An-Elmo and Build-A-Cookie Monster), [[Hasbro]] ([[Monopoly (game)|Sesame Street Monopoly]]), [[Wooly Willy]], [[Betty Crocker]] (Elmo Fruit Snacks), [[C&D Visionary]] (air freshners) and [[Children's Apparel Network]]. Former liscencees include [[Nintendo]], [[Applause]], [[Child Dimension]], [[Gibson Greetings]], [[Gorham Fine China]], [[Ideal Toys]], [[Milton Bradley Company]], [[Palisades Toys]], [[Questor]], [[Radio Shack]], [[Tyco]], and the [[Western Publishing Company]]. [[Creative Wonders]] (a partnership between [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[Electronic Arts]]) produced Sesame Street software for the Macintosh, since at least 1995 & on the PC since 1996<!--1994?-->; [[Atari]] produced ''Sesame Street'' games in 1983. Before going bankrupt, [[Palisades Toys]] was to release a line of deluxe series action figures, for adults, as part of Sesame Workshop's push to expand into retro products for teens and adults.

[[Tickle Me Elmo]] was one of the fastest selling toys of the 1996 season. That product line was and still is one of the most successful products Mattel has ever launched. Both it and its most notable successor, TMX, have caused in-store fights. Elmo starred in a [[Christmas special]] that year, in which he wished every day of the year was Christmas.<ref>{{cite news | last=Gliatto | first=Tom | title=Elmo Saves Christmas | date=[[December 23]] [[1996]] | publisher=People | url=http://search.epnet.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=rch&an=9612201526}}, accessed in EBSCOhost.</ref>

Its fiction books are published on five continents, primarily by [[Random House]] in North America. Over 18 million ''Sesame Street'' books and magazines were purchased in 2005.<ref name="presskit">[http://www.sesameworkshop.org/aboutus/pressroom/presskits/season37/sesame_street.php Sesame Workshop: Sesame Street Season 37 Press Kit]</ref> The books often mention that children do not have to watch the show to benefit from its publications.

Live touring show ''[[Sesame Street Live]]'' presents costumed actors and dancers as characters from the series, in original plots. In recent years, VEE has had four touring casts, each performing a unique multi-million dollar budget show. Each season, the tours reach 160 different cities across North America, reaching 2 million people annually. Since the first production of ''Sesame Street Live'' on [[September 17]] [[1980]], 48 million children and their parents have seen the show performed, across the world.<ref name="sslpress">''Sesame Street Live'' Press Kit, Minneapolis MN: Vee Corporation, 2004.</ref>

Langhorne, Pennsylvania, United States, is the long-time home to ''Sesame Street'' theme park [[Sesame Place]]. New to the park for summer 2006 are three new rides themed to the popular ''Elmo's World'' segments. Another theme park, ''[[Parque Plaza S<U+00E9>samo]]'', exists in [[Monterrey]], [[Mexico]], and [[Universal Studios Japan]] includes a three-dimensional movie based on the show.

The [[Sesame Beginnings]] line, launched in mid-2005, consists of apparel, health and body, home, and seasonal products. The products in this line are designed to accentuate the natural interactivity between infants and their parents. Most of the line is exclusive to a family of Canadian retailers that includes [[Loblaws]], [[Fortinos]], and [[Zehrs]].

Although ''Sesame Street'' characters occasionally endorse non-educational products, they rarely appear in their puppet form, to limit the suggestion to children that the characters are formally endorsing the product. The Muppets do appear in puppet form to endorse select causes. Big Bird has promoted safe seating practices and the wearing of seatbelts, for the [[Ford Motor Company]],<ref>{{cite news | first=Thomas L. | last=Bryant | url=http://search.epnet.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=rch&an=9706193803 | title=Big Bird and Ford | publisher=Road & Track | pages= | page= | date=July 1997 | accessdate=2006-03-02}}, accessed through EBSCOhost.</ref> while Grover promoted a new course on children's informal learning, created by [[Harvard University]] with Sesame Workshop.<ref>{{cite news | first=Debra | last=Viadero | url=http://search.epnet.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aph&an=16357051 | title=Grover Promotes Harvard Course | publisher=Education Week | pages=1/5th | page=6 | date=[[2 March]] [[2005]] | accessdate=2006-03-02}} The course itself was developed by professor Joseph Blatt, who told Education Week "it focuses on how to harness the positive power of the media to improve children's health, particularly problems that stem from alarming levels of obesity among youngsters nationwide." Guests to the course include Sesame Workshop staff. Students are required to pitch media projects to promote healthy behaviors among 6- to 9-year-olds to Sesame executives at the end of the course.</ref> Elmo has appeared before the US Education Appropriations Subcommittee to urge more spending on music in schools.<ref>Bruce Morton, "Mr. Elmo goes to Washington".

===Internationally===
''Plaza S<U+00E9>samo'', ''Sesamstra<U+00DF>e'', ''Sesame English'' and ''Sesamstraat'' have all had merchandise of their local characters. ''Shalom Sesame'' videos and books have also been released.

In 2004, [[Copyright Promotions Licensing Group]] (CPLG) became Sesame Workshop's licensing representative for [[The Benelux]],{{Fact|date=February 2007}} adding to their United Kingdom representation.<ref>Previously [[The Licensing Company Ltd.]] held the British rights to ''Sesame Street''.

===Web site===
Sesame Street's Web site was one of the first to include educational materials, for both parents and children. "There are downloadable games plus number- and alphabet-coloring pages for the children.

==Movies, videos, and specials==
[[Image:Tv_movie_christmas_eve_oscar_legs_86th_street.jpg|right|200px|thumb|''[[Christmas Eve on Sesame Street]]'' scene with [[Oscar the Grouch|Oscar]] (in garbage can) and [[Big Bird]] at the 86th Street [[New York City Subway]] station]]
A series of ''Sesame Street'' telefilms have featured the characters on day trips or in foreign countries. ''[[Don't Eat the Pictures: Sesame Street at the Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'' (1983) saw the cast locked in the gallery overnight; Big Bird and Snuffy help a cursed boy pharaoh. NBC's ''[[Big Bird in China]]'' (1983) followed Big Bird, Barkley, and their new friend Xiao Foo traveling through China to find Feng Huang, the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] bird. In ''[[Big Bird in Japan]]'' (1988), the titular character gets lost. ''[[Out to Lunch (1974 special)|Out to Lunch]]'' (1974) features the cast of ''Sesame Street'' and ''[[The Electric Company]]'' taking over [[ABC News]]. Big Bird turned six in ''[[Big Bird's Birthday or Let Me Eat Cake]]'' (1991), despite being referred to as four years old previously. ''[[CinderElmo]]'' (1999) was a FOX special, with [[Keri Russell]] as the princess look for her match among the kingdom. Telly fears what the [[New Year]] will bring in ''[[Sesame Street Stays Up Late!]]'' (1993, DVD in 2004).

Various strictly musical programs have been made. [[Julie Andrews]] and [[Perry Como]] performed with the Muppets on ''[[Julie on Sesame Street]]'' (1974). ''[[Evening at Pops: 1971]]'' and ''[[Evening at Pops: 2001]]'' are two special episodes of PBS series ''[[Evening at Pops]]'' variety show have featured ''Sesame Street'' characters. The ''[[Sesame Street Special]]'' (1988) also included many guest performances.

Holiday special ''[[Christmas Eve on Sesame Street]]'' (1978) won an Emmy Award, while another special that year, ''[[A Special Sesame Street Christmas]]'' (1978), has mostly unfavourable reviews. Anniversary specials include ''[[A Walking Tour of Sesame Street with James Earl Jones]]'' (1979), ''[[Sesame Street: 20 And Still Counting]]'' (1989), ''[[All-Star 25th Birthday: Stars and Street Forever]]'' (1994) and ''[[Sesame Street Jam: A Musical Celebration]]'' (1994), and ''[[The Street We Live On]]'' (2004). [[Jon Stewart]] is set to host a "live" retrospective on the series on ABC, but is accidentally locked in his dressing room with the tapes. Elmo attempts to salvage the show, improvised, in ''[[Elmopalooza!]]'' (1998).

In 1987 and 1992, episodes of ''[[Shalom Sesame]]'' were produced, focusing on introducing Jewish culture, customs, and language to [[Jewish-American]] children. International co-productions of ''Sesame Street'' have created many of their own specials as well.

The characters have made appearance on television series including ''[[Between the Lions]]'' (2001), ''[[The Electric Company]]'' (1972, 1975), ''[[Emeril Live]]'' (2005), ''[[Fanfare]]'', ''[[The Flip Wilson Show]]'' (1970), ''[[The Frugal Gourmet]]'' (1992, 1995, 1997), ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', ''[[Martha]]'' (2006), ''[[Martha Stewart Living]]'', ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'' (1981), ''[[Soul Man]]'' (1998), ''[[The Torkelsons]]'' (1991), ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'' (2004), ''[[What's My Line?]]'', and numerous talk shows and mornings shows, ranging from ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' to the ''[[The Today Show]]''.

Characters have also appeared on specials and videos not related to the series, including ''[[The Grover Monster and Jean Marsh Cartoon Special]]'' (1975), ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney|NBC Salutes the 25th Anniversary of the Wonderful World of Disney]]'' (1978), ''[[The Road to China]]'' (1979), ''[[I Love Liberty]]'' (1982), ''[[Kathie Lee Gifford's Lullabies for Little Ones]]'' (1996), and ''[[The We Are Family Foundation|We Are Family]]'' (2005).

===Feature films===
[[Image:Tv sesame street dvd follow that bird.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Follow that Bird'' movie poster.]]
Two feature films based on the series have been made.

Co-produced with [[Warner Bros.]], the 1985 film ''[[Sesame Street Presents: Follow that Bird]]'' revolved around a social worker forcing Big Bird into adoption. Big Bird gets homesick and tired of his adoptive parents, and heads back to New York, when he is kidnapped by evil carnival leaders (played by [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]] and [[Joe Flaherty]]); the residents of Sesame Street launch a cross-country search to find him.

In the second ''Sesame Street'' theatrical film, called ''[[The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland]]'', fourteen years after ''Follow That Bird'' in 1999, [[Elmo]] spends time with his favorite blanket. After [[Zoe]] accidentally tears the blanket, when Elmo refuses to share, the blanket winds up in [[Grouchland]], ruled by the [[Queen of Trash]] ([[Vanessa Williams]]). Elmo ventures forth, to rescue his blanket from the villainous [[Huxley]] ([[Mandy Patinkin]]). Soon, the rest of the ''Sesame Street'' gang follow in pursuit.

According to a rumor posted on /FILM, Elmo has suggested to TVguide.com that ''Elmo's World'' might later be turned into a movie. <ref>Peter Sciretta, "[http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php/20060703232029680 Elmo's World: The Movie?]", 4 July 2006.</ref>

==Criticism==
Some educators criticized the show when it debuted, feeling that it would only worsen children's attention spans. This concern still exists today, although there is no conclusive proof of this being the case, even after more than 35 seasons of televised shows.

In a letter to the ''Boston Globe'', [[Boston University]] professor of education Frank Garfunkel commented "If what people want is for their children to memorize numbers and letters without regard to their meaning or use <U+2014> without regard to the differences between children, then ''Sesame Street'' is truly responsive. To give a child 30 seconds of one thing and then to switch it and give him 30 seconds of another is to nurture irrelevance."<ref name="feinstein">{{cite news | last=Feinstein | first=Phylis | title=All About Sesame Street | date=1971 | publisher=unknown | url=http://members.tripod.com/~hooperfan/chap12.html}}</ref>

In the magazine ''[[Childhood Education]]'', Minnie P. Berson of [[State University of New York at Fredonia|SUNY Fredonia]] asked "Why debase the art form of teaching with phony pedagogy, vulgar sideshows, bad acting, and layers of smoke and fog to clog the eager minds of small children?"

For an animation on the letter "J", the writers included "a day in jail." This drew criticism from ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' columnist [[Terrence O'Flaherty]], despite executive producer David Connell's assertion that kids are familiar with the word through shows like ''[[Batman]]'' and ''[[Superman]]'', and that "when you're trying to come up with a lot of words starting with J, you soon run short" of words they are already familiar with.<ref name="feinstein">{{cite news | last=Feinstein | first=Phylis | title=All About Sesame Street | date=1971 | publisher=unknown | url=http://members.tripod.com/~hooperfan/chap12.html}}</ref>

The series also met with criticism in its attempts to help the underprivileged. Educator Sister Mary Mel O'Dowd worried that the show might start to replace "personalized experiences". "If Sesame Street is the only thing ghetto kids have, I don't think it's going to do much good. It never hurts a child to be able to count to 10 or recognize the 26 letters of the alphabet. But without the guidance of a teacher, he'll be like one of our preschoolers who was able to write 'CAUTION' on the blackboard after seeing it on the back of so many buses, and told me 'That says STOP.'"<ref name="feinstein">{{cite news | last=Feinstein | first=Phylis | title=All About Sesame Street | date=1971 | publisher=unknown | url=http://members.tripod.com/~hooperfan/chap12.html}}</ref>

Though it is widely beloved, like a number of PBS shows (notably [[WGBH]]'s ''[[Postcards From Buster]]'') ''Sesame Street'' has long had to contend with those who disagree with its social content. [[Gerald S. Lesser]] comments in his book ''Children and Television: Lessons from Sesame Street'' that the show faced hostility in the southern United States when it first aired because it portrayed people of various races mingling peacefully.{{Facts|date=February 2007}} At first the [[Commission for Educational Television]] in Mississippi refused to air the show. However, the commission had no choice but to allow their local public television stations to air the show when commercial stations in Mississippi said they would air the program themselves. <ref name="mandel">{{cite journal | journal=The Journal of American Culture | last=Mandel | first=Jennifer| title=The Production of a Beloved Community: Sesame Street<U+2019>s Answer to America<U+2019>s Inequalities | date=2006 | accessdate = 2006-08-21 | publisher=Blackwell Publishing, Inc. | url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1542-734X.2006.00270.x}}</ref>

==Rumors and urban legends==
While many rumors have been started about the series, a few have been widely promulgated and perpetuated over the years.

It has widely been suggested that [[Bert and Ernie]] are a [[gay]] couple, as they are apparently adult human males portrayed sharing a bedroom, though with separate beds. A 1980 collection of humorous essays by [[Kurt Andersen]], titled ''The Real Thing'', made light of the growing rumor. "Bert and Ernie conduct themselves in the same loving, discreet way that millions of gay men, women and hand puppets do. They do their jobs well and live a splendidly settled life together in an impeccably decorated cabinet."<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> The rumor was promulgated repeatedly, so much so that by 1993, Sesame Workshop had a prepared statement to send out to people inquiring on the topic. In a 1994 effort to get the characters banned, Rev. Joseph Chambers stated on his radio show: "Bert and Ernie are two grown men sharing a house and a bedroom. They share clothes, eat and cook together and have blatantly effeminate characteristics. In one show Bert teaches Ernie how to sew. In another they tend plants together. If this isn't meant to represent a homosexual union, I can't imagine what it's supposed to represent."<ref>James R. Petersen, [http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/anijerry.htm The Ridiculous Right (say it ain't so, Barney)], December 1995</ref> Both Steve Whitmire as Ernie and Eric Jacobson as Bert have stated publicly that the characters are not gay.<ref>[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Bert_and_Ernie%27s_Relationship Muppet Wiki: Bert and Ernie's relationship], accessed [[30 June]] [[2006]].</ref> The alleged relationship has been parodied on the adult animated series ''[[Family Guy]]'' and by ''[[Ernest & Bertram]]''. The latter, a 2002 short film that ran at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], was the subject of a cease and desist order from the legal department of Sesame Workshop.<ref>{{cite news | last=San Vicente | first=Romeo | title=Bert and Ernie outed from film festival | date=[[March 27]] [[2002]] | publisher=PlanetOut | url=http://www.planetout.com/pno/entertainment/news/splash.html?sernum=154}}</ref> The Broadway musical ''[[Avenue Q]]'' includes two characters similar to Bert and Ernie, who explore the issue of homosexuality. 

The pair's relationship bears similarity to that of [[Laurel and Hardy]], who were also occasionally shown sleeping together; this became such a comedy staple as to be adopted by [[Morecambe and Wise]] in the 1970s, all of whom were similarly asexual. ''[[The Odd Couple]]'' is another, more apposite, contemporary comparison. Some adult viewers are upset by the assertions, as in their view, Ernie and Bert act like children, teenagers at the oldest, and are no more different than brothers or cousins who share a room.

In 1990, puppeteer [[Jim Henson]]'s death spurred rumors that Ernie would be "killed off" the show, much the way the character of Mr. Hooper was after actor [[Will Lee]]'s passing some years earlier. Rumor said that he would be either killed by a vehicle, [[AIDS]], or [[cancer]]. There was no legitimacy to this rumor, but because producers took their time recasting a puppeteer for Ernie, the delay allowed the claims to burgeon. A spokesperson for the series was quoted as saying "Ernie is not dying of AIDS, Ernie is not dying of leukemia. Ernie is a puppet."<ref>

In [[2002 in television|2002]], Sesame Workshop announced that an character with [[HIV]] would be introduced to ''[[Takalani Sesame]]'', the [[South Africa]]n version of the show. Many conservatives and religious groups wrongly presumed that the American version would be getting a "gay Muppet," presumably because of the early historical connection between homosexuality and HIV in the U.S., but the character with HIV is only present on this international version of the show. The character, [[Kami (Takalani Sesame)|Kami]], contracted HIV from a blood transfusion as an infant.
