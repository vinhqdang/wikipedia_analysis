In [[1981]], the 16-year old Ha<U+0161>ek joined the top hockey league in the country, playing for his home team [[HC Pardubice]] of the [[Czechoslovak Extraliga]]. After making his mark and eventually playing for the Czechoslovakian National team, Ha<U+0161>ek decided to enter the NHL draft and was drafted by the Chicago Blackhawks in [[1983 NHL Entry Draft|1983]]. At the time, NHL teams were wary of drafting players from behind the [[Iron Curtain]] who were often unwilling to play in the NHL or barred from doing so by their countries. Consequently, Ha<U+0161>ek was picked in the 10th round (199th overall) and was the seventeenth goalie selected. Ha<U+0161>ek did not even know he had been drafted until several months later.<ref name="draft">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=18282|title=Dominik Hasek|publisher=''legendsofhockey.net''|accessdate=2006-08-05}}</ref>

Until [[1990]], Ha<U+0161>ek played in his native Czechoslovakia for [[HC Pardubice]] and [[HC Jihlava]]. He was named the [[Golden Hockey Stick (Czechoslovakia)|top ice hockey player]] of the Czechoslovak Extraliga in 1987, 1989, and 1990, and Goaltender of the Year from 1986 through 1990.<ref name="TSNprofile">{{cite web|url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/teams/players/bio/?id=126&hubname=nhl-red_wings|title=TSN.ca player profile|publisher=''[[The Sports Network]]''|accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref> With [[Czech lands: 1918-1992#The end of the Communist era .281989.29 and the Velvet Revolution 1989|the end of the communist rule]] in 1989, the borders of the Soviet Bloc countries opened, allowing Ha<U+0161>ek to emigrate to the United States with aspirations of playing in the NHL.<ref name="draft"/> His American career began with the [[Indianapolis Ice]] of the [[International Hockey League|IHL]], where he played parts of two seasons. His NHL debut with the Blackhawks finally came in the [[1990-91 NHL season|1990<U+2013>91 season]], eight years after the 1983 NHL Entry Draft.

==NHL career==
In Chicago, Ha<U+0161>ek spent time as the backup to [[Ed Belfour]], and played only 25 games over two seasons with the Blackhawks. On [[November 6]], [[1990]], wearing the number 31, Ha<U+0161>ek made his first NHL start in a 1<U+2013>1 tie against the [[Hartford Whalers]].<ref name="detroit page">{{cite web

His first victory came on [[March 8]], [[1991]] in a 5<U+2013>3 performance over the Buffalo Sabres, and on [[January 9]], [[1992]], he recorded his first shutout in a 2<U+2013>0 win against the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].<ref name="detroit page"/>

On [[August 7]], [[1992]], Ha<U+0161>ek was traded to the Buffalo Sabres for goalie [[Stephane Beauregard]] and future considerations, which later materialized into a draft pick used to obtain [[Eric Daze]]. In Buffalo, wearing number 39, he was initially the backup goaltender, first playing behind [[Tom Draper]] and then [[Grant Fuhr]]. When Fuhr was injured partway through the season, Ha<U+0161>ek was elevated to starter, where he developed into a top tier goaltender. In [[1993-94 NHL season|1994]], he won his first [[Vezina Trophy]], and shared the [[William M. Jennings Trophy]] with Fuhr. Ha<U+0161>ek played 58 games with a league-best 1.95 [[Goals against average]] (GAA), seven shutouts, and a .930 [[save percentage]]. He followed this feat by again winning the Vezina Trophy in [[1994-95 NHL season|1995]].

Ha<U+0161>ek's continued success in the [[1996-97 NHL season|1996<U+2013>97 season]] was overshadowed by a conflict with then-head coach [[Ted Nolan]]. The conflict created a tense, clique-like atmosphere in the Sabres' clubhouse.<ref name="rattling">{{cite news

Behind the strong play of Shields, the Sabres fought back against the Senators and took the series in seven games. However, Ha<U+0161>ek claimed his knee was still injured and did not play in the five-game loss in the following series against the [[Philadelphia Flyers]].

Though General Manager [[John Muckler]] was named "Executive of the Year", he was fired for his constant feuding with Nolan. Ha<U+0161>ek, who sided with Muckler, stated in an interview during the 1997 NHL Awards Ceremony that it would be better if Nolan was not rehired.<ref>{{cite news

[[Image:Hasekpractice.jpg|275px|left|thumb|Ha<U+0161>ek in warm-up before a game against the [[Los Angeles Kings]] on March 9, 2007.]]
After the Senators were eliminated in the second round, they opted not to re-sign Ha<U+0161>ek, despite Ha<U+0161>ek's willingness to take a pay cut. 
On [[July 31]], [[2006]], at the age of 41, Ha<U+0161>ek joined the Red Wings for the third time. He signed a one-year $750,000 US 
contract, with added bonuses if the team succeeded in the playoffs. He posted 38 wins and a 2.05 GAA while leading the Red Wings to 
the number one seed in the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]]. He also broke his own personal record by going 181 minutes and 17 seconds without allowing a goal.<ref>{{cite web

Ha<U+0161>ek won both games, clinching the series for Detroit. In the next round against the [[San Jose Sharks]], the Red Wings were on the road and down two games to one, but Ha<U+0161>ek held the Sharks to only three goals in the next three games. His 28-save shutout in game six tied him for sixth place on the all-time NHL playoff shutouts list and sent the Red Wings to the Western Conference finals against the [[Anaheim Ducks]]. Ha<U+0161>ek failed to win back-to-back games against the Ducks however, and the Wings lost the series in six games. 

Currently, Ha<U+0161>ek and his family are discussing whether or not he will come back to play in the NHL and his option will be revealed in the next couple of weeks.

Ha<U+0161>ek goes down on almost every [[Shot (ice hockey)|shot]], covering the bottom of the net, where the majority of goals are scored.

===Milestones===
Ha<U+0161>ek won his 300th National Hockey League game on [[October 15]], [[2005]], in a 5<U+2013>1 home victory with the Ottawa Senators over the Boston Bruins. He stopped 34 of 35 shots in the win, and was holding a shutout until Bruins forward [[Pat Leahy (ice hockey)|Pat Leahy]] jammed a loose puck under him three minutes into the third period. Ha<U+0161>ek became the twenty-second goaltender to reach this milestone.<ref name="MainBio"/> He is the oldest goaltender in NHL history to post a 30-win season, and was the first goaltender to ever win the Lester B. Pearson Award in 1997 for most outstanding player in the entire league. He is also the only goaltender to win the Hart Trophy twice for Most Valuable Player, and is only one Vezina Trophy away from tying Jacques Plante's total of seven for most all-time.

===Records===
In nine seasons with the Buffalo Sabres, Ha<U+0161>ek acquired over 25 franchise records, including most all-time games played, wins, shutouts and lowest goals against average.<ref name="HockeydCentral"/> He also holds the Sabres' record for most shutouts in a single season with 13 in 1997<U+2013>98, and lowest goals against average in a single season with a total of 1.87 in 1998<U+2013>99. During the Detroit Red Wings' championship run in 2002, Ha<U+0161>ek set franchise records for most games played, minutes played, wins and shutouts in a playoff year. He is also on several notable NHL records lists:
