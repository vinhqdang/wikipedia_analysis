'''Ultimo''' is a fictional giant [[robot]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  It was once controlled by [[Mandarin (comics)|the Mandarin]] and used against [[Iron Man]], but has fought Iron Man several times even when not under the Mandarin's control.  While having been dismantled by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] at one point, it has reappeared since.

==Origin==
It has been confirmed that Ultimo is thousands of years old, and that he was constructed by an alien species that has since been destroyed by their own creation. They called the robot "The doomsday device", apparently a weapon of mutually assured destruction. Ultimo confirmed that his "masters" have not contacted him in "thousands of years".

The first time (chronologically speaking) Ultimo is depicted in print (in flashback in Iron Man vol.3, #24), he is already travelling through space, and has attacked the planet Rajak, ultimately killing all its people. The only survivors, a group of merchants who were off-planet at the time, attempted to destroy him, but had to flee before his might. In the end they managed to lure him into an asteroid belt, where both he and the ship were battered by space rocks until they were driven off-course and separately crashlanded on an unknown planet - Earth. This happened around the 1840s.

==First appearance==
In "Tales of Suspense" #76, the Mandarin first reveals Ultimo as his  "Greatest creation" . He must have found the robot and reprogrammed it to serve him, charging it with geothermal energy inside a volcano and giving it its current name. The giant robot vanquishes a force of Chinese soldiers sent to despatch the Mandarin and nearly destroys Iron Man, but is drawn by him back into the volcano. Unfortunately for him, it has been destabilized by his activity and erupts, swallowing the robot whole in a conflagration of red-hot lava.
This proved to not be enough to destroy him, however.

In later appearances Ultimo fights both Iron Man and the rest of the Avengers, even on the Capitol Mall, before finally being dumped in yet another volcano. He is not heard from for years after that, until, in Iron Man vol.1 #298, he is revealed to be the cause for a series of earth tremors. Over the years, he has drifted across the entire length of the continental plate, soaking up gigantic amounts of geothermal energy, and is thus "For the first time in centuries, fully charged". The then-current version of Iron Man (the remote-controlled NTU-150) proves no match for him, and is torn to pieces - and the cybernetic backlash to Tony Stark<U+00B4>s nervous system renders him comatose.

==Ultimo Versus the Iron Legion==
In ''Iron Man'' (1st series) #300, the 64 pages edition, Ultimo fights the Iron Legion. The Iron Legion is led by Jim Rhodes, in the [[War Machine]] Armor, as he is accompanied by Happy Hogan, Eddie March (the first substitute Iron Man), [[Bethany Cabe]], Mike O'Brien (formerly Guardsman) and Carl Walker (formerly Force). With the exception of Bethany, each has previously worn an Iron Man suit. However, Rhodes says that he knows from "Personal experience" that Bethany knows how to handle herself. Since Stark is down, Rhodes calls them in, and has Abe Zimmer (Stark<U+00B4>s tech wiz) take a number of old armors out of storage, (see [[Iron Man's armor]]) and has him get all of them up to somewhat functional standards. However, Zimmer says that they will not function anywhere near capacity, since Stark stored them for sentimental reasons only, not with the idea that they would never be used again (The fact is that these suits must be copies anyway, since the originals were unequivocally destroyed in #175). Eddie is in the gray, original suit, and is the first to get hit by Ultimo. His attempted rescue by Carl Walker, in the "classic" Iron Man armor, leads to Carl getting shot, and the suit begins to melt, forcing him to have to eject. While Beth and Happy aid Carl and Eddie, Rhodes, together with Mike in the Silver Centurion suit attack Ultimo in order to provide a distraction. At this point, Rhodes has decided that this wasn't what he had in mind for this battle, and decides on a change of plan. Happy is to get Carl and Eddie to the hospital, while Bethany and Mike head to Futura to start evacuations. Bethany objects, and convinces Rhodes to allow her to buy time against Ultimo with him. At this point, Tony Stark has come out of his coma and has donned the new Modular Iron Man suit. With a Full-Spectrum Scanalyzer and Railgun Launcher, he heads out to aid in the fight against Ultimo. Stark successfully takes out Ultimo single-handedly, by causing a lightning bolt to strike the robot<U+00B4>s  "central nervous system" . His scans indicate that Ultimo is several thousand years old, and Stark intends to have it hauled off for study.

==Ultimate Devastation==
Years later, the robot is the property of Stark-Fujikawa, the company which bought Stark<U+00B4>s company when he was believed dead (after the events of "the Crossing").
SF<U+00B4>s engineers, having performed extensive research of the hulking, inert robot, managed to access its control programs, and now the company intents to use the enormous energy reserves stored inside Ultimo to provide cheap electricity to the entire Western USA. 
Unfortunately, the ship built on top of the dormant doomsday device is attacked by Goldenblade and Sapper - ironically, representatives of the doomed Rajaki race, seeking to steal energy to resurrect those Rajaki that still survive as data patterns aboard the crashed vessel - who accidentally wake up Ultimo, and the robot immediately sets out to destroy the ship. Unfortunately, the city of Spokane is on his route, and will be destroyed unless he is stopped. Goldenblade, Sapper, the superheroine Warbird, SHIELD and the US army all work together with Iron Man to slow the giant down, while he attempts to use what data the Stark-Fujikawa engineers managed to obtain to break into Ultimo<U+00B4>s core programming once more.
Moments before the city is reached, Tony Stark manages to convince the giant killer robot that he is one of his "Masters" and orders him to shut down. 

Afterward, Ultimo is dismantled and his systems "fried" by the transfer of his energy stores to the Rajaki vessel.

However, he reappeared in "Avengers: the Initiative" #1, facing the Mighty Avengers - just long enough to be deactivated by a ''single shot'' of the Tactigon, a weapon of unknowable power, at the time in the hands of the girl called Armory. Despite this lacklustre showing, it does mean he reassembled himself from being completely dismantled, and also that is it extremely likely that he will return in time.

==Power and abilities==
Ultimo is, obviously, incredibly strong and nearly undestructible. Despite his bulk, he is deceptively fast, being able to walk at about 100 miles per hour. He can absorb and store immense amounts of heat energy. He can project energy beams from his eyes, the power of which varies with his own energy level (but at full power they can easily ''vaporize'' several dozens of tons of rock in a single blast). He can, over time, significantly increase his size (and presumably strength and durability): When he first appeared, he was "only" 25 feet tall, but after his years-long lava bath underneath the Earth<U+00B4>s crust, he had grown to 60 feet; later, after Stark-Fujikawa<U+00B4>s engineers accessed his systems, they made him grow to "over a hundred feet" (depiction details are somewhat variable, with footprints implying a height of about 500 feet).
Ultimo has also shown he can adapt his defenses; for instance, while he once was deactivated by a lightning bolt, this later proved ineffective.
Finally, he seems capable of repairing himself even when deactivated and completely disassembled.
