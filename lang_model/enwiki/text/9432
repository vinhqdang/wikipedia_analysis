The '''New England Patriots''', nicknamed the "'''Pats'''" by sports writers and fans,<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/clubhouse?team=nwe ESPN.com] An example of the "Pats" nickname being used within sports reports. Accessed 26 January 2006.</ref> are a professional [[American football]] team based in [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]]. They are currently part of the [[AFC East|Eastern Division]] of the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The team's ownership changed the name, originally the '''Boston Patriots''', after [[relocation of professional sports teams|relocating the team]] to Foxborough in [[1971 in sports|1971]].

An original member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL), the Patriots joined the NFL in the [[AFL-NFL Merger|1970 merger]] of those leagues. The team advanced to the playoffs four times before appearing in [[Super Bowl XX]] in January [[1986 in sports|1986]]. This Super Bowl appearance resulted in a loss to the [[Chicago Bears]]. The team also appeared in [[Super Bowl XXXI]] in [[1997 in sports|1997]], losing to the [[Green Bay Packers]]. 

Between [[2001 in sports|2001]] and [[2004 in sports|2004]], the Patriots became the second team in NFL history (after the [[Dallas Cowboys]]) to win three Super Bowls in four years ([[Super Bowl XXXVI]], [[Super Bowl XXXVIII|XXXVIII]], and [[Super Bowl XXXIX|XXXIX]]), and the eighth (and to date, most recent) to win consecutive Super Bowls.  Their dominance in the early part of the decade has some dubbing them as the modern NFL [[dynasty (sports)|dynasty]].

{{main|History of the New England Patriots}}

===1959-1969===
On [[November 16]] [[1959]], Boston executive [[William Sullivan, Jr.]] was awarded the eighth and final [[franchise]] of the developing [[American Football League]] (AFL).  The following winter, locals were allowed to submit ideas for the Boston football team's official name.  The most popular choice<U+2014>and the one that Sullivan selected<U+2014>was '''"Boston Patriots"'''.  Immediately thereafter, Phil Bisell developed the "Pat Patriot" logo (see [[Logos and Uniforms of the New England Patriots]]).  

Training camp started on [[July 4]], [[1960 Boston Patriots season|1960]], two months prior to the franchise's first game.<ref>[http://www.patriots.com/history/index.cfm?ac=History Patriots History] Accessed 26 January 2006.</ref> On [[September 9]], 1960, the Boston Patriots played the [[Denver Broncos]] in the first-ever AFC regular season game. The Patriots were defeated by a score of 13<U+2013>10. The Patriots missed the AFL playoffs for their first three seasons. However, in [[1963 Boston Patriots season|1963]] the Patriots reached the [[AFL Championship]] for the first time; they lost to the [[San Diego Chargers]] 51<U+2013>10. The Patriots failed to make it to the AFL playoffs for the rest of the decade. During this period fullback [[Jim Nance]] developed into an offensive weapon for the Patriots, gaining 1,458 yards in [[1966 Boston Patriots season|1966]], when he was the American Football League's [[MVP]].<ref>[http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/NancJi00.htm/ Jim Nance statistics] Accessed 25 January 2006.</ref><ref>[http://football.about.com/od/nflhistory/l/bl_awardsmvp.htm NFL MVP player of the year] Accessed 25 January 2006.</ref>

===1970-1991===
The Patriots' second decade began with significant changes. In [[1970 Boston Patriots season|1970]], the Patriots' franchise joined the NFL pursuant to the merger of the AFL and NFL that had been agreed to three years earlier. The Patriots were merged into the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC), where they remain to the present day. However, the Patriots' first season as part of the NFL resulted in a record of 2<U+2013>12, sole possession of the newly merged league's worst record. Despite the lack of wins, local morale increased in [[1971 in sports|1971]] when the Patriots moved into a new stadium in [[Foxborough, Massachusetts|Foxborough]] (also known as Foxboro). The stadium, to be known as [[Schaefer Stadium]], became Sullivan Stadium in [[1983 New England Patriots season|1983]] and, ultimately, [[Foxboro Stadium]] in [[1990 New England Patriots season|1990]]. This marked stability for the Patriots, who shifted between four different Boston-area stadiums since its creation.  In March [[1971 New England Patriots season|1971]], the team was renamed the '''"Bay State Patriots"''' and later that year the '''"New England Patriots"''' to reflect the relocation.

By the early [[1970s]], several new players were added to the lineup, including [[Heisman Trophy]]<ref>[http://www.nationalchamps.net/NCAA/heisman/heisman_trophy_winners.htm Heisman trophy winners] Accessed 25 January 2006.</ref> winner [[Jim Plunkett]]<ref>[http://www.profootballhof.com/history/general/draft/1971.jsp 1971 NFL draft] Accessed 25 January 2006.</ref> and offensive lineman [[John Hannah (NFL player)|John Hannah]], who became the first career Patriot to make the Hall of Fame in [[1991 New England Patriots season|1991]].<ref>[http://www.collegefootballnews.com/Top_100_Players/Top_100_Players_13_John_Hannah.htm Top 100 Players: 13 - John Hannah]. Information on John Hannah's career, including a list of awards, which features the 1991 NFL Hall of Fame induction. Accessed 29 January 2006.</ref>Despite the changes in personnel, the Patriots' series of losing seasons continued into the early 1970s. [[Chuck Fairbanks]] was hired as head coach and [[general manager]] in [[1973 New England Patriots season|1973]] after leading a top-ten program at the [[University of Oklahoma]]. Fairbanks began assembling one of the most talented - but ultimately underachieveing - squads in the NFL of the 1970s. The Patriots finished 7<U+2013>7 in [[1974 New England Patriots season|1974]] and 3<U+2013>11 in [[1975 New England Patriots season|1975]], which resulted in offensive changes. Plunkett was traded to the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and replaced by second year player [[Steve Grogan]]. 

After the string of losing seasons, the Patriots finished the [[1976 New England Patriots season|1976 season]] with an 11<U+2013>3 mark &mdash; the best record in team history to that point &mdash; and a playoff slot for the first time since [[1963 in sports|1963]]. In the first round of the [[NFL playoffs, 1976-77|1976 playoffs]], the Patriots lost to the [[Oakland Raiders]] 24<U+2013>21. In [[1978 New England Patriots season|1978]], Fairbanks was fired as head coach when it was revealed he had been secretly hired as the new head coach of the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]]. Fairbanks was replaced by [[Ron Erhardt]], who coached the team to a playoff appearance later that year. The Patriots lost to the [[Houston Oilers]] in the [[NFL playoffs, 1978-79|first round]] and did not return to the tournament until [[1982 New England Patriots season|1982]]. Under new coach [[Ron Meyer]], the Patriots were once again eliminated in the [[NFL playoffs, 1982-83|first game]] &mdash; this time by the [[Miami Dolphins]]. With the team unable to assemble playoff victories, the Sullivans replaced head coach Ron Meyer with former [[wide receiver]] [[Raymond Berry]] in [[1984 New England Patriots season|1984]].

In the [[1985 New England Patriots season|1985 regular season]], the team finished with an 11-5 record and obtained a [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] playoff berth. The Patriots won three road [[NFL playoffs, 1985-86|playoff games]] on their way to [[Super Bowl XX]] &mdash; an NFL record.<ref>[http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nwe1985.htm 1985 New England Patriots Statistics]. Features information on the Patriots' wins during the 1985 season and playoffs. Accessed 26 January 2006.</ref> At Super Bowl XX, the Patriots surrendered a 3-0 first quarter lead and lost to the [[Chicago Bears]] by a score of 46-10. The following season, New England won the [[AFC East]] with another 11<U+2013>5 record, but fell to the Broncos in the first round of the playoffs. Local resident [[Doug Flutie]] was a member of the Patriots during the [[1987 New England Patriots season|1987]] and [[1988 New England Patriots season|1988]] seasons, in which they finished with records of 8<U+2013>7 and 9<U+2013>7, respectively. Berry remained head coach through both seasons.

During the late [[1980s]] and early [[1990s]], the Patriots' lack of playoff appearances was underscored by personnel changes and controversy within the Sullivan ownership.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/158261525X Book discussing various aspects of the Patriots sports franchise] Website accessed January 31, 2006.</ref> The Sullivan family lost millions of dollars on expensive investments, including [[The Jackson 5]]' [[1984]] Victory tour. Additional pressure was placed on the ownership when they calculated that $100 million [[United States Dollar|USD]] was already invested in the franchise.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0D6163FF93AA15753C1A96E948260 Patriots Change Hands]. Associated Press article, published on [[October 29]], [[1988]]. Website accessed February 1, 2006.</ref> These financial losses and demands forced the Sullivans to sell the team.  In [[1986]], [[Francis W. Murray]] arranged financing to keep the team afloat and, in return, was granted an option to purchase the team.  When Murray tried to exercise his option, the Sullivans refused to acknowledge his rights and Murray sued and won in court.  As a result, Murray agreed to partner with [[Victor Kiam]] to purchase the team in [[1988]].  Kiam and Murray purchased the team for $84 million &mdash; $16 million USD less than the cost of the team.<ref>[http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/nengalnd/patriots.html Sports Encyclopedia]. Kiam owned 51% and Murray 49%. Information relating to Kiam's purchasing of the Patriots in the late 1980s.

Associated Press article, published on [[October 29]], [[1988]]. Website accessed February 1, 2006.</ref> Meanwhile, entrepreneur [[Robert Kraft]] began his involvement with the Patriots by purchasing Sullivan Stadium (previously Schaefer Stadium) on [[November 23]], [[1988]]. Essentially, Kraft owned the stadium and Kiam possessed the team.<ref>[http://www.patriots.com/history/index.cfm?ac=History Patriots History]. Information relating to Kraft purchasing Sullivan Stadium and renaming it Foxboro stadium. Accessed January 31, 2006.</ref> During this leadership change, head coach Berry was replaced by [[Rod Rust]] &mdash; a change that was short-lived.

The Patriots' worst season in franchise history &mdash; a 1-15 record &mdash; came under Rust in [[1990 New England Patriots season|1990]]. During the season, the Patriots were thrown into the middle of a sexual harassment scandal when ''[[Boston Herald]]'' reporter [[Lisa Olson]] was sexually and verbally assaulted by several Patriots players in the team's locker room &mdash; a bad situation made worse by Kiam first deriding the reporter as "a classic [expletive]" and by making lewd jokes at public events about the whole affair instead of allowing it to die quietly. Following an investigation into the scandal, NFL Commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]] fined the team $50,000 USD, and players [[Zeke Mowatt]], [[Michael Timpson]] and [[Robert Perryman]] $12,500, $5,000, and $5,000 USD respectively. Rust was fired and replaced by [[Dick MacPherson]] at the end of the season. The Olson scandal and the 1-15 record are cited as the two primary reasons why Rod Rust was told to leave.<ref>[http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/nengalnd/patriots.html Lisa Olsen sexual harassment scandal] Accessed 31 January 2006.</ref>

===1992<U+2013>1997===
In [[1992 New England Patriots season|1992]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] businessman [[James Orthwein]] became sole owner of the Patriots franchise, sparking rumors of a possible franchise relocation to St. Louis. However, no move was scheduled for the 1992 season, despite a 2-14 record.<ref>[http://www.patriots.com/history/index.cfm?ac=History Patriots History]. Orthwein takes over the franchise, which sparks controversy over a possible franchise relocation. Accessed 31 January 2006.</ref>  During the 1992-1993 offseason, the Patriots shifted gears by replacing MacPherson with [[Bill Parcells]]. The team's draft selections for the offseason included top overall pick [[Drew Bledsoe]], who was [[quarterback]] of the team until [[2001 New England Patriots season|2001]], and wide receiver [[Troy Brown]]. Despite these acquisitions, the [[1993 New England Patriots season|1993 season]] resulted in 5-11 record, and rumors about relocation to St. Louis rekindled during the offseason. However, one hurdle to relocation was the Patriots' stadium lease. The owner of [[Foxboro Stadium]], [[Robert Kraft]] rejected a $75,000,000 USD buyout bid to void the remaining years of the lease<ref>[http://www.patriots.com/team/index.cfm?ac=mgersexecsbio&bio=547 Patriots.com Robert Kraft Biography]. Biographical info on Kraft including events leading up to the buyout. Accessed 3 April 2007</ref>, prompting Orthwein to put the franchise up for sale. Kraft then proceeded to outbid the field of competition and obtained full ownership of the Patriots in [[1994 New England Patriots season|1994]].<ref>[http://www.patriots.com/history/index.cfm?ac=History Patriots History]. Kraft takes over in 1994, saving the team from a move. Accessed 31 January 2006.</ref> Kraft implemented changes in organization and leadership, which culminated in a ten-season stadium sell-out streak from [[1996 New England Patriots season|1996]] to the present.

New England entered the 1994 season after drafting first round and fourth overall pick on defensive end [[Willie McGinest]], who would later play [[linebacker]] on all three Super Bowl-winning teams. Although the team lost in the first round of the [[NFL playoffs, 1994-95|playoffs]] and finished the [[1995 New England Patriots season|1995 season]] with a 6<U+2013>10 record, Kraft decided to keep Parcells. In [[1996 New England Patriots season|1996]], the Patriots finished with an 11<U+2013>5 record and an AFC East division championship. The team eventually advanced to [[Super Bowl XXXI]], where they lost to the [[Green Bay Packers]] 35<U+2013>21. Parcells would leave to coach the [[New York Jets]].

=== 1997-2000===
Due to rising tensions between Parcells and Kraft, Parcells resigned, and was replaced by [[Pete Carroll]] in [[1997 New England Patriots season|1997]]. Meanwhile, the Patriots and the New York Jets began switching players and coaches, including the aforementioned Parcells and running back [[Curtis Martin]]. Nevertheless, New England finished with a 10<U+2013>6 record and first place in the AFC East. The Patriots defeated the Miami Dolphins 17<U+2013>3 at home in the opening round, before losing against the Pittsburgh Steelers by a score of 7<U+2013>6. In the [[1998 New England Patriots season|1998 season]], the Patriots finished 9<U+2013>7, and lost to the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] in the first round of the playoffs. A subpar [[1999 New England Patriots season|1999 season]] resulted in Carroll's firing.

===2000-present===
After Carroll was fired, [[Bill Belichick]], hand-picked to be Parcells' successor with the Jets, quit after one day as Jets head coach to join New England. In [[2000 New England Patriots season|2000]], Belichick's first season resulted in a 5<U+2013>11 record. In [[2001 New England Patriots season|2001]], quarterback Drew Bledsoe was injured in the second game of the season on a hit by Jets linebacker [[Mo Lewis]], and was replaced by [[Tom Brady]], a sixth-round draft pick, who then led the team into the playoffs with an 11<U+2013>5 record. The Patriots defeated the Oakland Raiders, in the so-called [[The Tuck (NFL game)|"The Tuck" game]] played in a driving snowstorm in Foxborough, followed by defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers in the [[NFL playoffs, 2004-05|AFC Championship Game]].  That set up their third trip to New Orleans and [[Super Bowl XXXVI]], where, amidst a theme of patriotism spawned by the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 terror attacks]], they defeated the [[St. Louis Rams]] on a last-second field goal by [[Adam Vinatieri]]. In New England's first Super Bowl victory, Brady drove his team 48 yards in 1:21 with no timeouts, and was selected [[Super Bowl MVP]]. An estimated 1.5 million people turned out in Boston for the Patriots' first victory parade.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2004/11/01/crowd_size_could_be_in_the_eye_of_beholder/ Boston.com] "Crowd size could be in the eye of the beholder." Accessed 5 June 2007.</ref> In the 2002 offseason, Bledsoe was traded, in an unusual move, within the division, to the [[Buffalo Bills]].

In [[2002 in sports|2002]], Robert Kraft opened the new [[Gillette Stadium]] after privately funding its construction. After getting no support from the [[Massachusetts|Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] to build a new stadium, Kraft made a deal to move the team to [[Hartford, Connecticut]] in [[1998 in sports|1998]].<ref>[http://www.ct.gov/governorrowland/cwp/view.asp?A=1331&Q=256172 CT.gov] Story on Kraft moving the team to Hartford. Accessed 18 April 2006.</ref> However, environmental cleanup problems with the Hartford site, combined with Massachusetts' eventual willingness to loan $57,000,000 USD in infrastructure costs around Foxboro to be repaid through parking revenue led to a reversal of the Hartford deal.  As a result of threats of lawsuits by Connecticut Governor [[John Rowland]], Kraft paid $2.4 million USD to Connecticut to avoid any future litigation.<ref>[http://www.sportslawnews.com/archive/articles%201999/Patriots1.html Sportslawnews.com] Information on the reversal of the Hartford deal.

The Patriots missed the [[NFL playoffs, 2002-03|2002 playoffs]] after finishing with a record of 9<U+2013>7 and missing out on the division title via a tiebreaker to the New York Jets. In [[2003 New England Patriots season|2003]], the Patriots started 2<U+2013>2 but finished with a 14<U+2013>2 record and fourteen straight wins on their way to [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] against the [[Carolina Panthers]].  The Patriots won by a score of 32<U+2013>29; the final three points came from another Adam Vinatieri field goal. Brady was named Super Bowl MVP for the second time in his career.

In [[2004 New England Patriots season|2004]], the Patriots broke the NFL all-time regular season consecutive winning streak record of 18 straight wins, with a victory against the Miami Dolphins. Later in the season, the Patriots lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers, which halted their winning streak at 21 games. However, the NFL only counts regular-season wins in determining the consecutive wins record, so the Patriots' streak officially stands at 18 games.
[[Image:BostonCityhall.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Patriot fans rally in front of Boston City Hall following the 2004 Super Bowl XXXVIII championship]]
After finishing the 2004 season with a 14-2 record, the Patriots defeated the [[Indianapolis Colts]] and Pittsburgh Steelers en route to [[Super Bowl XXXIX]]. The Patriots went on to defeat the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] by a score of 24<U+2013>21. The victory made the Patriots the first team in six years to repeat as NFL Super Bowl champions, and the second team ever to win three Super Bowls in four years.  After the 2004 season, Belichick's top two coordinators, [[Charlie Weis]] and [[Romeo Crennel]], left the team to pursue head coaching positions. Significant players moved on as well, including longtime Patriot [[cornerback]] [[Ty Law]].  Linebacker [[Tedy Bruschi]] missed half of the [[2005 New England Patriots season|2005 season]] while recovering from a mild stroke.  During the 2005 season, the team lost several starters to injuries, including [[safety (football position)|safety]] [[Rodney Harrison]] and [[offensive tackle]] [[Matt Light]].  At the end of the season, the Patriots won the AFC East with a 10<U+2013>6 record.  The Patriots defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars 28<U+2013>3 in the first round of the [[NFL playoffs, 2005-06|playoffs]] before losing to the Denver Broncos 27<U+2013>13.  New England became the seventh team in NFL history to fail on a chance to win the Super Bowl in three consecutive seasons, the last team to do so being the Broncos.

The [[2006 New England Patriots season|2006 off-season]] saw the departure and arrival of several personnel. [[Dean Pees]] took over as [[defensive coordinator]] when [[Eric Mangini]] left the team to become head coach of the New York Jets.  Quarterbacks coach [[Josh McDaniels]] was promoted to [[offensive coordinator]] after New England went one season without replacing Charlie Weis.  Notable Patriot players [[David Givens]], Willie McGinest, and Adam Vinatieri left New England for the [[Tennessee Titans]], [[Cleveland Browns]], and Indianapolis Colts respectively. [[Deion Branch]] would later be traded to the [[Seattle Seahawks]] after a contract holdout. Despite this, they finished the 2006 regular season with a 12-4 record and won the AFC East for the fourth consecutive time.  The Patriots went on to defeat their rival, the Jets 37-16 in the [[NFL playoffs, 2006-07|wild card round]].  The following game, Brady, despite throwing 3 INTs, engineered a 4th quarter comeback to defeat the San Diego Chargers by the score of 24-21.  They faced the Colts in the AFC Championship but lost 38-34 after leading 21-3 early in the game, to date the largest collapse in NFL conference championship history.

The Kraft years have provided a major turnaround for the fan base of the Patriots. Before Kraft's arrival, the Patriots rarely played at Foxboro Stadium's maximum capacity (with the only exception being the highly successful [[1986 New England Patriots season|1986 season]]).  The attendance was particularly low during the early 1990s, when poor performance and the aforementioned rumors of franchise relocation to [[St. Louis, Missouri]] loomed; the average home attendance was below 60% of maximum capacity. However, the improvements made during Bill Parcells' coaching tenure (both on and off the field) resulted in a rejuvenation of the fan base. From the [[1996 New England Patriots season|1996 season]] onward, every Patriots home game has sold out, both at Foxboro and Gillette stadiums, including preseason games. <ref>[http://www.kenn.com/sports/football/nfl/nfl_nep_attendance.html Attendance information from 1980-] Accessed 1 February 2006</ref><ref>[http://slam.canoe.ca/StatsFBP/BC-FBP-STAT-NEWENGLANDATTCOMP-R.html Specific information on 2003- Sell-out streak] Accessed 1 February 2006</ref>

The team's on field performance has drastically improved since Robert Kraft bought the team in [[1994 New England Patriots season|1994]]. Before Kraft, the Patriots won the AFC East three times, made the playoffs six times (including their AFL Championship berth in 1963) in 34 years and went to the Super Bowl once. Since Kraft, the Patriots have won the AFC East eight times, made the playoffs nine times and have been to the Super Bowl on four occasions, winning three.
