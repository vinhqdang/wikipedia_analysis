The '''France national rugby union team''' is a national sporting side that represents [[France]] in [[rugby union]]. They compete annually against [[England national rugby union team|England]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] in the [[Six Nations Championship]]. They have won the championship outright on fourteen occasions, shared in another eight titles and completing eight [[Grand_Slam_%28rugby_union%29#Six_Nations_Championship|grand slams]]. 

They are currently the [[IRB World Rankings|third ranked team]] in the world&mdash;behind New Zealand ("The [[All Blacks]]") and [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]].<ref name=WorldRank>{{cite web | publisher=irb.com|title=IRB World Rankings |url=http://www.irb.com/EN/World+Rankings/  |accessdate=2007-07-05}}</ref> Six former French players have been inducted into the [[International Rugby Hall of Fame]].

Rugby was introduced to France in 1872 by the British, and on [[New Year's Day]], [[1906]] the national side played its first [[Test match]]&mdash;against New Zealand in Paris. France played sporadically against the British [[Home Nations]] until they joined them to form a Five Nations tournament (today, the Six Nations Championship) in 1910. France also competed in early [[Summer Olympics]] when rugby was included&mdash;winning one gold and two silver medals. France came of age during the 1950s and 1960s, winning their first of many Five Nations titles. They won their first [[Grand Slam (rugby union)#Six Nations Championship|Grand Slam]] in 1968, and won numerous titles in the following years. Since the inaugural World Cup in 1987, France have qualified for the knock-out stage of every tournament and reached the final twice. They were runners-up to the All Blacks in [[1987 Rugby World Cup|1987]] and to [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] in [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999]]. France are the host nation for the upcoming [[2007 Rugby World Cup]].

France traditionally play in white-trimmed blue shirts with blue shorts and red socks, and are commonly referred to as ''les tricolores'' or ''les bleus''. The French emblem is a red badge with a [[rooster]]. Their alternative strip is mainly white. French internationals are played at a variety of venues throughout the country, but it is [[Stade de France]] in the [[Paris]] suburb of [[Saint-Denis]] that is used for their games during the Six Nations. 
==History==
{{main|History of the French national rugby union team}}
Rugby was introduced to France in 1872 by British merchants and students.<ref name="hundyears">{{cite web | url=http://www.irb.com/EN/News/Features/061114+dk+fre+rugby+100.htm| title=100 years of French Test rugby: part one | publisher=International Rugby Board | author=Chris Thau | date= [[2006-11-14]]| accessdate=2007-03-29}}</ref> Although France were represented at the [[1900 Summer Olympics]] (where they won gold),<ref name="olympics">{{cite web | url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/olympics.htm#france1900| title=Rugby at the 1924 Olympics | publisher=Rugby Football History | accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref> their first official test match did not take place till [[New Year's Day]], [[1906]] against the [[All Blacks|New Zealand All Blacks]] in [[Paris]].<ref name="ABGame88">{{cite web| url=http://stats.allblacks.com/teamsheet.asp?MT_ID=1088 |title=8th All Black Test : 88th All Black Game |publisher=allblacks.com |accessdate=2007-03-30}}</ref> France then played intermittently against the [[Home Nations]] until they joined them to form the Five Nations tournament in 1910.

France became the first nation from the northern hemisphere to tour South Africa winning the test series in 1958. The Springboks also visited Paris in 1961, the test was not completed due to onfield fighting amongst the players. France also toured [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]] in 1961 losing both tests against the All Blacks but defeating Australia's [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallabies]]. They won their first [[Grand Slam (rugby union)#Six Nations Championship|Five Nations Grand Slam]] in 1968 by beating all four other competing teams, and won numerous titles in the following years.<ref name="results"/>

France hosted some of the tests during the [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991 World Cup]], but made their exit from the after being knocked out by England at Twickenham in their quarter-final.

==Strip==
[[Image:Logo XV de france.JPG|250px|thumb|The jersey of the French rugby team, with the traditional rooster symbol.]]
Until 1912, the [[Uniform#Sports|strip]] (uniform) of the French team was white with two rings, one red and one blue.<ref name="logo1">{{cite web | url=http://www.sncf.com/actu/rugby/LSDT-premier-maillot-Equipe-France.html| title=Le premier maillot de l'Equipe de France | publisher=Sncf.com | accessdate=2007-03-04 |language=French}}</ref>  After the first game won by France against Scotland in 1911, France's captain Marcel Communeau asked that the team adopt the ''coq'' (rooster) as its symbol.<ref name="logo2">{{cite web | url=http://rugby-nomades.qc.ca/info-nomades/histoire_1911.php| title=2 janvier 1911 : la naissance d<U+2019>une Nation | publisher=Rugby-nomades.qc.ca | accessdate=2007-03-04 |language=French}}</ref> The rooster was probably chosen partly because it is considered as a proud and combative animal that can be sometimes aggressive, although it had been used previously as a symbol by a French team&mdash;a former soccer player, Jean Rigal, wore a uniform with this emblem as early as May 1910.<ref name="logo3">{{cite web | url=http://crdp.ac-bordeaux.fr/rugby/arts/5-01-02.pdf| format=PDF|title=Le coq dans le sport  | publisher=Crdp.ac-bordeaux.fr | accessdate=2007-03-04 |language=French}}</ref> The badge was initially white and red, but was altered to a multicoloured, embroidered image after 1945, and has been golden since 1970.<ref name="logo4">{{cite web | url=http://crdp.ac-bordeaux.fr/rugby/arts/5-01-01.pdf| format=PDF|title=Le coq sportif | publisher=Crdp.ac-bordeaux.fr | accessdate=2007-03-04 |language=French}}</ref>

The symbol used by the French rugby team was a great success, and was later adopted by the French delegation at the Olympic Games of 1920 where the rooster was perched on five Olympic rings.<ref name="logo5">{{cite web | url=http://www.museedusport.fr/histoire_objet.php| title=Ecusson en forme de coq, devenu embl<U+00E8>me national | publisher=Musee du Sport | accessdate=2007-03-04 |language=French}}</ref> The rooster has since become a well-known symbol of French teams. French players are sometimes called ''les coqs'' and some French supporters have been known to release roosters on the playing field before games.<ref name="RoosterField">{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/03/0302_060302_france_birdflu_2.html |publisher=natinoalgeographic.com |accessdate=2007-06-25 |date=[[2006-03-02]] |title=Bird Flu Strikes at French Identity, Cuisine |last=Owen |first=James}} </ref>

The French team traditionally played in blue shirts, whites shorts, and red socks, and as such they were nicknamed ''les tricolores''. Due to the mostly blue [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] strip the French team currently wears, the team is now often referred to as ''les bleus'' (the blues). When this strip clashes with that of their opponents, such as in games against Scotland and Italy, French players wear white. New strips have been developed for the 2007 World Cup, one which is a darker blue. This would likely see the All Blacks wear grey or white if they were to meet in the tournament.<ref name="new">{{cite web | url=http://home.nzcity.co.nz/news/default.aspx?id=72647&cat=977| title=All Blacks may not be all black | publisher=NZ City | accessdate=2007-05-01}}</ref> This was rumoured to be a move to gain a psychological edge over the All Blacks, but this has been denied.<ref name="new"/>

==Record==
===Six Nations===
France's only annual tournament is the [[Six Nations Championship]], which is played against five other European nations: England, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, and Wales. France first contested the tournament in 1910 when the Home Nations became the Five Nations.<ref name="RollofHonour">{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/international/3422419.stm |title=Six Nations roll of honour |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2007-05-03 |date=[[2004-01-29]]}}</ref> France were expelled from the tournament due to rumours of professionalism in the then amateur sport in 1932, but rejoined in 1947. They first won the competition in 1954, sharing the championship with both England and Wales. France shared with Wales again the following season, and won it outright for the first time in 1959.<ref name="RollofHonour"/> France's longest wait for a championship spanned 37 tournaments (1910&ndash;1954). The [[Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy]] is also contested between France and Italy during the Six Nations.

==Training==
===Coaches===
Historically the role of French rugby coach (or ''trainer'') has varied considerably. Due to the status of rugby union as an amateur sport for most of its history, the job of deciding tactics and running team trainings has often been that of the captain or senior players. Therefore a comprehensive list of national coaches is impossible. 

Although coached by [[Jean Desclaux]] between 1973 and 1980, the French team's main influence during the late 1970 was captain [[Jacques Fouroux]]. Fouroux played {{scrum-half}} and captained France to their 1977 Five Nations Grand Slam, during which France played a very forward-oriented style of rugby.<ref name="Dine155">Dine (2001), pg 155.</ref> Although the style of ''Fouroux's Gang'' was successful, it was criticised because it contrasted with the traditional open attacking style of French rugby.<ref name="Dine155"/> Fouroux was given the nickname "the little Corporal"&mdash;the same as [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].<ref name="FourouxTelObituary">{{cite web| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/12/20/db2002.xml |title=Jacques Fouroux |publisher=telegraph.co.uk |date=[[2005-12-20]] |accessdate=2007-05-06}}</ref> Fouroux was named as Desclaux's successor in 1981 at the age of just 33. He continued to promote a forward-oriented style of play, and France won six Five Nations titles&mdash;including two Grand Slams&mdash;while he was coach. After nearly ten years in the role he resigned in 1990 after a defeat to Romania.<ref name="Dine160">Dine (2001), pg 160.</ref>

Fouroux was succeeded by [[Daniel Dubroca]], who coached the team to the 1991 Rugby World Cup.<ref name="Brine172">Brine (2001), pg 172-173.</ref> Dubroca's tenure as coach did not last long, however, as he resigned after violently confronting referee [[David Bishop]] following France's World Cup quarter-final against England.<ref name="Brine172"/><ref name="1992IHT">{{cite news| url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1992/03/19/rugb.php |title=French, in Anglo-Saxon Game, Can No Longer Rest on Latin Laurels |publisher=International Herald Tribune |accessdate=2007-05-06 |date=[[1992-03-19]] |last=Patel |first=Tara}}</ref> Dubroca was replaced by [[Pierre Berbizier]], who coached the team until after the 1995 Rugby World Cup.<ref name="BerbizierAttack">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/6311205.stm |title=Berbizier launches Laporte attack |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2007-05-06 |date=[[2007-01-29]]}}</ref> Berbizier's replacement, [[Jean-Claude Skrela]], coached France to Five Nations Grand Slams in 1997 and 1998 before they came last in the tournament in 1999.<ref name="SkrelaQuit">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/rugby_union/523219.stm |title=Sport: Rugby Union Skrela steps down as French coach |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2007-05-06 |date=[[1999-11-16]]}}</ref> He officially resigned following France's loss to Australia in the tournament final. [[Bernard Laporte]] was appointed as Skrela's successor in November 1999 and has held the position ever since.<ref name="LaporteAppointed">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/rugby_union/532229.stm |title=Laporte gets France job |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2007-05-06 |date=[[1999-11-22]]}}</ref>
