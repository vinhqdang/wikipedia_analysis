== Series development ==
=== Production ===
''Wild Arms'' was the first [[console role-playing game]] project of [[Media.Vision]], a subsidiary of [[Sony Computer Entertainment]], that had been known primarily for their [[shooter game]] series ''Crime Crackers'' and ''[[Rapid Reload]]''.<ref name="GameFAQsMV">{{cite web | author=Veasey, Jeff | title=Game Companies: Media Vision |year= |format= | work=GameFAQs.com | url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/company/996.html | accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref>  Looking for a way to capitalize on the growing [[console role-playing game|role-playing game]] market of the mid-nineties, [[Sony]] commissioned Media.Vision to create a game that would combine elements of a traditional RPG with limited [[3D computer graphics|3D]] graphics to promote the hardware of their newly-released [[PlayStation]] [[game console|console]].<ref name="Absolute">{{cite book |editor=Sony Computer Entertainment |title=Wild Arms: Absolute Reading for Marvelous Supporters |year=2006 |publisher=AZA Entertainment |isbn=4-8402-3668-2 |pages= |language=Japanese}}</ref>  Supervised and designed primarily by Akifumi Kaneko and Takashi Fukushima, 1996's ''[[Wild Arms]]'', while still retaining traditional [[dimension|two-dimensional]] characters and backgrounds, became one of the first role-playing titles released to showcase 3D battle sequences.  

Utilizing a unique approach to setting and character design, the original ''Wild Arms'' set the standard for all future games in the series.  Drawing inspiration from [[Western (genre)|American westerns]], as well as western-themed [[manga]] such as [[Yasuhiro Nightow]]'s ''[[Trigun]]'', Kaneko and Fukushima crafted a video game world that resembles the contemporary [[fantasy]] environment seen in similar titles, but with added allusions to gun-play, outlaws, lawmen, and wilderness tamers.<ref name="Chronicle">{{cite book |editor=Sony Computer Entertainment |title=Wild Arms Fargaia Chronicle |year=1999 |publisher=SGE Visual Works |isbn=4-7973-1107-X |pages= |language=Japanese}}</ref>  References to seminal role-playing game elements influenced by [[Europe]]an fantasy such as [[castle]]s, [[magic (fantasy)|magic]], [[dragon]]s, and monsters,  were added to attract players to a familiar concept, as well as extended the story-telling past the western medium to allow scenario writers from other elements.<ref name="Chronicle" />  Other cultural and regional influences include [[Norse mythology|Norse tales]], [[animism]], and [[Japanese mythology]].<ref name="Absolute" />

=== Music ===
The [[background music]] of ''Wild Arms'' follows the games' continued motif by providing a [[soundtrack]] reminiscent of [[Western film]]s.  The groundwork for the series' music was laid by composer [[Michiko Naruke]], who had previously only written the scores to [[Super Nintendo|Super Famicom]] titles.<ref name="LostFantasy">{{cite web | author=Lost Fantasy staff | title=Michiko Naruke Discographie |year= |format= | work=Lost Fantasy.com | url=
http://www.lost-fantasy.com/naruke.php?page=discographie | accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref>  Recurring instrumentation includes [[acoustic guitar]]s, [[mandolin]]s, [[drum]]s, [[woodwind instrument|woodwind]] and [[brass instrument]]s, and [[piano]]s accompanied clapping and [[whistling]] samples.  While classically influenced, the music of each game often diverges into other genres, including [[folk music|folk]], [[rock music|rock]], [[electronic music|electronic]], [[swing music|swing]], and [[choral music|choral]].<ref name="POT">{{cite book |author=Naruke, Michiko and King Records staff |editor=AZA Entertainment |title=Wild Arms Piece of Tears Songbook |year=2006 |publisher=(packaged with ''[[Wild ARMs Music the Best -feeling wind-]]''). King Records |isbn= |pages=4 |language=Japanese}}</ref>  Naruke composed the soundtracks for the first three ''Wild Arms'' titles herself, yet she contributed to the soundtrack for ''[[Wild Arms 4]]'' along with [[Nobuyuki Shimizu]], Ryuta Suzuki, and Masato Kouda, who emulated her now-established style.<ref name="RPGFanWA4">{{cite web | author=Wilson, Mike | title=RPGFan Soundtrack - Wild Arms the 4th Detonator Original Score |year=2006-03-26 |format= | work=RPGFan.com | url=

== Recurring themes ==
[[Image:AlterCodeFGame01.png|165px|left|thumb|Rudy brandishing an ARM from ''[[Wild Arms Alter Code: F]]'']]
[[Gun]] use factors heavily into the ''Wild Arms'' [[mythos]], where the operation of such devices leads to conflict in each game.  Called "ARMs", these weapons are often associated with ancient technology and represent a more violent and war-like age, thus a social stigma is often given to anyone possessing or using them.<ref>'''Townsperson''': I know about you. You possess the [ARM]. The forbidden power!{{cite video game|title=Wild Arms |developer=Media.Vision |publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment |date=1997-04-30 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref>  Though the exact nature varies from one game to the next, they are seen as highly destructive devices with an array of functions in battle.  The practical usage of ARMs, either to protect or destroy life, is left to the user's discretion, and serves as a plot point within each game to establish a character's true motives.<ref>'''Virginia''':  My father disappeared into the wasteland, but one thing he taught me was the ability to handle ARMs. If there's anybody out there--out there in the vast wasteland needing my help, I want to have wings so that I can fly right to them. {{cite video game|title=Wild Arms 3 |developer=Media.Vision |publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment |date=2002-10-15 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref><ref>'''Jude''': "That guy...He referred to my ARM as the 'power that sparked and fueled a war'... Weapons such as ARMs are responsible for what happened to places like Ciel and that other town, aren't they...? Maybe my power really can't protect anything..." / '''Raquel''': "Remember when I told you that there are both good and bad Drifters? And that I wanted to be a good Drifter?" / '''Jude''': "Yeah..." / '''Raquel''': "Well, it's the same for you. You just need to focus on using your power for good, that's all."{{cite video game|title=Wild Arms 4 |developer=Media.Vision |publisher=XSeed Games |date=2006-01-10 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> 

[[Environmentalism]] is also a key factor in many ''Wild Arms'' games, which often center around the restoration of the environment that has long since been tainted, either by warfare or natural phenomena.  The governing forces of the planet are personified as "Guardians", spirit-like [[anthropomorphic]] creatures who act as the [[gods]] of natural aspects such as water, fire, and wind, along with human traits such as love, hope, and courage.  The primary heroes of each game often ally themselves with these Guardians to defeat technology-reliant or ecologically unconscious villains who would either subjegate or destroy the world to suit their respective goals.<ref>'''Guardian Gurdijeff''': Warriors! Do you still seek our power?! / '''Cecilia''': We can't possibly do this ourselves... / '''Jack''': I want the power... I want to defeat them... / '''Gurdijeff''': Because you are weak, you seek power... We shall give you the power that you seek, but time is running out. (''Wild Arms'')</ref><ref>'''Irving''':  That's right. Contact the mystical Guardians who protect the world, and they may also aid us in battle. We have finally discovered the key to contacting them. {{cite video game|title=Wild Arms 2 |developer=Media.Vision / Contrail |publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment |date=2000-04-30 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref>   
<br clear="all">

=== Setting ===
Each ''Wild Arms'' story takes place on a planet called Filgaia, a [[fantasy]] world made to resemble the [[United States|American]] West characterized by large deserts, red rock canyons, and dry plains.  Several other land types and climates exist, including forests, mountainous regions, grasslands, and Arctic tundras, though their predominance varies from one game to the next.<ref name="Absolute" />  Though human towns and cities are plentiful, the wilderness that encompasses most of the landscape is ridden with [[monster]]s and other harsh beasts, as well as ruins or dungeons from earlier eras that house ancient treasures unaccessible to all but skilled adventurers.  Filgaia is also home to a number of different races including the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]-inspired Baskars, nature-dwelling Elws, and [[vampire|vampiric]] Crimson Nobles.<ref name="Chronicle" />

== Series overview ==
=== Games ===
As a Sony franchise, all ''Wild Arms'' video games appear exclusively on PlayStation video game consoles.  While each individual title is set in worlds completely independent of one another, they contain several consistencies  that have become series mainstays, including similar races, monsters, technologies, and plot points.  Though variations and stylistic differences persist in the overall presentation of each game, all titles can be considered "[[Weird West]]erns", combining attributes from traditional [[fantasy]], [[science fiction]], and [[steam punk]] story mediums.

* '''''[[Wild Arms]]''''' established many of the recurring themes seen in later installments, including western overtones, the desert world of Filgaia, and gun-like machinery called "ARMs" that would become the series namesake. It was the first ''Wild Arms'' title to feature the unique "tool" system that allowed special items such as [[bomb]]s or [[grappling hook]]s to be used out of combat to cross otherwise impassable terrain and destroy objects. Originally released in [[Japan]] for the PlayStation in [[1996 in video games|1996]], the game was later translated published in [[North America]] and the [[PAL region]] over the next two years by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]].  ''Wild Arms'' features [[dimension|two-dimensional]] characters and environments for normal game-play, while battle sequences are instead rendered in full [[3D computer graphics|3D]].<ref name="GameSpotWA1" />  The game follows the adventures of a band of "Dream Chasers", Rudy, Jack, and Cecilia, as they make their way across the desert-like world of Filgaia.

* '''''[[Wild Arms 2]]''''', the sequel to the first ''Wild Arms'', was the second and final title for the original PlayStation.  While keeping many of the themes from the previous title, ''Wild Arms 2'' introduced additional [[scifi]] elements, including more abundant high technology and [[cybernetic]]s, with additional fantasy and [[steampunk]] themes.  A total of six characters can be recruited during game-play, with the player able to switch between any of them at any time.

== Critical response ==
''Wild Arms'' has often been compared to such high-profile [[console role-playing game]] series as [[Square Enix]]'s ''[[Final Fantasy (series)|Final Fantasy]]''.  While some critics praise ''Wild Arms'' for its unique approach to storytelling,<ref name="IGNWA3" /> others denounce that it is at best a "filler" series meant to fill gaps between releases of other, more prominent titles.<ref name="IGNWA5" /> Each ''Wild Arms'' game has sold modestly in [[North America]] and [[Europe]], with no titles selling above the requisite amount to qualify for a "[[List of Sony Greatest Hits games|PlayStation Greatest Hits]]" or "[[Platinum range|Sony Platinum Range]]" distinction.<ref name="GreatestHits">{{cite web | author=Sony Computer Entertainment | title=PlayStation.com - PlayStation2 Greatest Hits |year= |format= | work=PlayStation.com | url=http://www.us.playstation.com/PS2/GreatestHits | accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref>  Sales in [[Japan]] has been significantly better, with the first five titles obtaining the equivalent "PlayStation the Best" or "PlayStation 2 the Best" distinction as well as reprints several months or years after their original release.<ref name="GameFAQs" /><ref name="GameFAQs2">{{cite web | author=Necropenguin and Ubersuntzu | title=Wild Arms 2 Game Info| format= | work=GameFAQs.com | url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/psx/data/199299.html | accessdate=2007-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=Necropenguin | title=Wild Arms 3 Game Info| format= | work=GameFAQs.com | url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/data/478787.html | accessdate=2007-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=AssassinKing, Dizzyfan, GTONizuka and Hel Saga | title=Wild Arms 4 Game Info| format= | work=GameFAQs.com | url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/data/918840.html | accessdate=2007-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=ClaudeLv250, CW Boi 209, Necropenguin and Prince_EXE | title=Wild Arms Alter Code: F Game Info| format= | work=GameFAQs.com | url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/data/918799.html | accessdate=2007-02-20}}</ref>  With the exception of ''Wild Arms 2'' and ''Alter Code: F'', each game has been released in the three major [[NTSC]] and [[PAL region]]s.
