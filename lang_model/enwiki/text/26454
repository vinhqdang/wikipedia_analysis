==Cast creation and influences==
[[Image:FFVIIIgirls.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tetsuya Nomura's designs of the three female protagonists: left to right, Selphie, Rinoa and Quistis]]
Scenario writer [[Kazushige Nojima]] stresses the dynamic of players' relationships with the main character in ''Final Fantasy'' games; thus, he puts significant thought into how that relationship will develop. With ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', protagonist [[Cloud Strife]]'s reserved nature led Nojima to include scenarios in which the player can select Cloud's responses to certain situations and dialogue. With ''Final Fantasy VIII'', which also features a reserved lead protagonist in Squall, Nojima wanted to give players actual insight into what the protagonist is thinking, even while other characters remain uninformed.<ref name="interviews">{{cite web | author=Square-Enix North America Site Staff | year=2001 | title=Behind The Game The Creators | url=http://www.square-enix-usa.com/games/FFX/btg/creators.html#1 | work=[http://www.square-enix.com/na/ Square-Enix North America] | accessdate=2006-04-12}}</ref>

[[Image:Laguna squall1.jpg|left|200px|thumb|[[Full motion video|FMV]] depictions of Laguna (left) and Squall, two of the main protagonists]]
Character designer Tetsuya Nomura, while exchanging e-mails with director [[Yoshinori Kitase]] during the period between the development of ''Final Fantasy VII'' and ''Final Fantasy VIII'', suggested that the game should have a "school days" feel. Because Nojima already had a story in mind in which the main characters were the same age, the idea worked. Thus, they created the concept of military academies, called "Gardens", in which students would train to become "SeeD" mercenaries. Nojima also planned for the two playable parties featured in the game <U+2014> Squall's present day group and Laguna Loire's group of twenty years in the past <U+2014> to highly contrast with one another. On one hand, Laguna's group consists of characters in their late twenties and have a lot of combat experience. They are also close friends who have fought together for a long time and trust one another. On the other hand, Squall's party is young and inexperienced, and Squall himself does not initially understand the value of friendship.<ref name="sheila">{{cite web | author=Sheila | year=2003 | title=Tetsuya Nomura 20s | url=http://flaregamer.com/b2article.php?p=81&more=1 | work=[http://flaregamer.com/ FLAREgamer] | accessdate=2006-04-13}}</ref>

As a result of Kitase's desire to give the game a foreign atmosphere ("foreign" being in relation to [[Japan]]), the objective with the character designs was to create largely [[Europe]]an appearances. The first character Nomura designed specifically for use in ''Final Fantasy VIII'' was Squall,<ref name="development2">{{cite web | author=Coxon, Sachi | year=1998 | title=Interview with ''Final Fantasy VIII'' developers | url=http://members.tripod.com/PlayStationJapan/ff8iview2.html | work=[http://members.tripod.com/PlayStationJapan/main.html PlayStation Japan] | accessdate=2006-07-15}}</ref> initially giving him longer hair and a more feminine appearance. However, Yoshinori Kitase did not feel that this design worked and asked Nomura to shorten his hair and make him look more masculine, which led to the design seen in-game. When designing Cloud Strife, Nomura gave him distinctly spiky, bright blonde hair to emphasize his role as that game's protagonist. With Squall, Nomura wanted to try a unique angle to establish his role, giving him the characteristic gunblade scar across the bridge of his nose. A complete history was not yet conceived, so Nomura left the explanation for Squall's scar to Nojima. Squall's design was completed by a feather motif along the collar of his jacket, included for the purpose of challenging the game's [[Full motion video|FMV]] designers. This is but one example of the demands he has consistently extended to the programmers of the ''Final Fantasy'' titles as technology has advanced.<ref name="sheila"/>

In a ''[[Famitsu|Famitsu Weekly]]'' interview with Kitase, Nomura and Yuusuke Naoi, the team agreed that ''Final Fantasy VIII'' reflects Nomura's preferred technique, as opposed to ''Final Fantasy VII'', which featured characters that "weren't really his style".<ref name="development2"/> The team also decided to use realistically proportioned characters. The higher level of FMV technology would have otherwise created an inconsistency between the in-game graphics and the higher definition FMV graphics. Additionally, Kitase explained that the main logo of the game <U+2014> Squall and Rinoa embracing <U+2014> was inspired by the team's efforts to express emotion through body language.<ref name="development2"/>

Most of the sequences involving Laguna appear in the form of "dreams" experienced by the protagonists. Squall always experiences these dreams from Laguna's point of view, although he does not think too highly of Laguna.<ref name="moron">'''Squall:''' "(I had a dream, too. It wasn't nice though... I dreamt I was a moron...)" (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref><ref name="badattitude">'''Squall:''' "You were a silly Galbadian soldier. I didn't like your attitude at all."

During the dream segments, he is a twenty-seven year old soldier in the Galbadian army who travels with his companions, [[#Kiros Seagill|Kiros Seagill]] and [[#Ward Zabac|Ward Zabac]].<ref name="Manual6"/> He is also an aspiring journalist whose weapon of choice is writing.<ref name="Manual6"/>

During the first two dream segments, he and his team are shown getting lost and visiting the hotel where singer [[#Julia Heartilly|Julia Heartilly]], Laguna's romantic interest, performs.<ref>'''Kiros:''' "Don't tell me we're lost again." / '''Laguna:''' "Anyway... We're goin' home. Deling City, here we come!" (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref><ref>'''Ward:''' "So, Laguna... Julia should be making her appearance soon. You goin' for it tonight?" (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> After a scouting mission at Centra, the three soldiers are separated and Laguna is injured. A young woman named [[#Raine Loire|Raine]] takes him to Winhill where he is nursed back to health.<ref name="Ellonenursing">'''Laguna:''' "I was bed-ridden for over 6 months. It seemed like every bone in my body was in pieces." / '''Raine:''' "I nursed him back to health." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> He falls in love with and marries her. However, he is drawn away from his new home when a young girl in their care, Ellone, is kidnapped. Laguna tracks her down in Esthar, where he helps liberate the people of Esthar from the despotic rule of [[#Adel|Sorceress Adel]]. The people of Esthar elect Laguna as their president and Ellone is sent back to Winhill without him.<ref name="Lagunastory2">'''Laguna:''' "A fierce debate ensued about who should govern this country after Adel was gone. I wasn't paying close attention while they made me up to be this hero of the revolution, and I ended up being president." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> After Raine dies, her child (who Ward and Kiros imply to be Squall in a conversation aboard the Ragnarok) and Ellone are sent to an orphanage.<ref name="Lagunastory1">'''Laguna''': "...Ellone was raised by Raine who lived next door. And I came to know her. Then there was another massive hunt for a successor in Esthar again. Elle was taken away..." "...so I rescued her and sent her off to Winhill. Shortly after that, Raine died. And Ellone was sent straight to an orphanage..." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> Laguna is unable to leave his post to visit her and remains president of Esthar to present day.<ref name="Lagunastory3">'''Laguna:''' "My job kept me busy. I was left here thinking about this and that and before I knew it, all this time had passed." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> Ellone and Laguna are reunited in space,<ref>'''Laguna:''' "Ellone followed me out to space. Little Elle was all grown up... Then she told me everything." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> and Laguna helps the party prepare for their fight against [[#Ultimecia|Ultimecia]].

The concept of two main characters was planned since the beginning of the game's development. Nomura tried to create a contrast between Laguna's and Squall's occupations; thus, Laguna became a soldier and Squall became a mercenary student. The designers intended Laguna to be more similar to the previous protagonists in the series to complement Squall, who is different from previous main characters.<ref name="sheila"/>

===Seifer Almasy===
[[Image:Ff8-seifer.jpg|120px|right|Seifer Almasy]]
{{nihongo|'''Seifer Almasy'''|<U+30B5><U+30A4><U+30D5><U+30A1><U+30FC><U+30FB><U+30A2><U+30EB><U+30DE><U+30B7><U+30FC>|Saif<U+0101> Arumash<U+012B>}} is a classmate and rival of Squall. He acts as a mirror to Squall in many respects, having dated Rinoa before she met Squall,<ref>'''Rinoa:''' "I don't really know. I... I think it was love. I wonder how [Seifer] felt...? ...It was last summer... I was 16." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> and assuming a leadership position among his friends.<ref name="Posse1">'''Raijin:''' "Seifer has a lot of followers, but we're his only friends... We're a posse, ya know...? The Galbadian soldiers are only listening to Seifer 'cause they fear the sorceress. Without us, Seifer wouldn't have a posse, ya know...?" (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> Like Squall, Seifer wields a gunblade which he calls "Hyperion".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://na.square-enix.com/games/ff8/seifer.html | title=Final Fantasy VIII Characters - Seifer | publisher=SquareEnix.com | accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref> His Limit Break, ''Fire Cross'', allows him to use an attack called ''No Mercy'', although he will later develop the more powerful techniques ''Demon Slice'' and ''Bloodfest''. Seifer has a short temper and is often depicted as a bully<ref>'''Seifer:''' "NAH-NA-NA-NA-NA-NAH!!!" / '''Boy Zell:''' "Stop teasing me, Seifer!" (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> who desires attention.<ref name="SeiferSquall">'''Quistis:''' "Yes! That's right! Seifer was a kid who always needed to be the center of attention. But Squall always used to ignore him... But eventually they would end up fighting." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> He is also fiercely independent and is often punished for his recklessness.<ref name="CidSeifer">'''Headmaster Cid:''' "Seifer. You will be disciplined for your irresponsible behavior. You must follow orders exactly during combat. But I'm not entirely without sympathy for you. I don't want you all to become machines. I want you all to be able to think and act for yourselves. I am..." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> He is the leader of Balamb Garden's disciplinary committee with his friends [[#Fujin|Fujin]] and [[#Raijin|Raijin]].

During the introduction sequence, Seifer cuts Squall across the left side of his face with his gunblade, leaving a scar. Squall retaliates with a backhand slash that leaves Seifer with a mirrored scar. At the following field exam in Dollet, Seifer acts independently from his teammates Squall and [[#Zell|Zell]], abandoning them; consequently, he fails and is not promoted to SeeD.<ref name="CidSeifer"/> Spurred by dreams of a brighter future, he [[defection|defects]] to [[#Edea Kramer|Sorceress Edea]] so he could be her "knight".<ref name="knight">'''Seifer:''' "I was hoping you'd be there, Squall. So...how'd I look in my moment of triumph? My childhood dream, fulfilled. I've become the sorceress' knight." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> From his point of view, Squall and the others are "evil" and he recognizes himself as the hero.<ref>'''Seifer:''' "What did you say!? Passed out cold, eh? This is the scene where you swear your undying hatred for me! The tale of the evil mercenary vs. the sorceress' knight... The fun's just started, Squall. Don't disappoint me now!" (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> As Seifer is brainwashed by the sorceress, he alienates himself from his friends. Eventually, Fujin and Raijin abandon him and he is defeated shortly afterward.<ref>'''Fujin:''' "You're being manipulated, Seifer. You've lost yourself and your dream. You're just eating out of someone's hand. We want the old you back! Since we can't get through to you, all we have now to rely on is Squall!" (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> At the end of the game, Seifer is seen fishing and having fun with Fujin and Raijin again.

Nomura had originally intended Seifer not only as Squall's rival, but also as part of the [[love triangle]] between him, Squall and Rinoa. Although this concept was not thoroughly explored in the final script, Seifer remains Squall's rival and his appearance was designed to contrast with Squall's. Not only do they have equivalent but mirrored scars on their faces, but their jackets are of opposing color and length. Both characters also use gunblades; Squall's gunblade is larger and requires two hands, while Seifer's gunblade is lighter and can be wielded with one hand.<ref name="sheila"/> Seifer makes an appearance in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' as a member of the Twilight Town Disciplinary Committee.<ref name="KH2gamespot">{{cite web | author=Gouskos, Carrie | date=2006-03-28 | title=Kingdom Hearts II for PlayStation 2 Review | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/kingdomhearts2/review.html | work=[http://www.gamespot.com GameSpot] | accessdate=2006-12-15}}</ref> In the English version, he is voiced by [[Will Friedle]].<ref name="IMDB">{{cite web | url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0390163/fullcredits#cast | title=Kingdom Hearts II (2005) - Full cast and crew | publisher=Internet Movie Database, Inc | accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>

Basically, that I lacked leadership qualities." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> Afterwards, she maintains a more informal relationship with the other characters as a fellow member of SeeD.

As a child, Quistis stayed at an orphanage with most of the main characters. She then lived with [[foster care|foster parents]], with whom she never developed any intimacy, before moving to Balamb Garden at age ten.<ref>'''Quistis:''' "I... remember. Yes, I remember now. Things didn't work out too well at my new home. So I came to Garden at the age of 10. That was when I was first noticed Seifer and Squall. Seifer and Squall were always fighting." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> She became a SeeD at fifteen and an instructor two years later.<ref> '''Quistis:''' I was a SeeD by the age of 15, got my instructor license at 17."</ref><ref name="Manual6"/> Quistis initially joins Squall to prepare him for his upcoming field exam. She later takes Squall into her confidence and tells him personally about her demotion.<ref>'''Squall:''' "It's after midnight." / '''Quistis:''' "Oh well... I, Quistis Trepe, am no longer an instructor as of now! I'm a member of SeeD now, just like you. Who knows, maybe we'll end up working together." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> When Irvine refreshes the main characters' memories about the orphanage, they remember that Squall's antisocial behavior began when Ellone, an older sister figure to Squall, left the orphanage unexpectedly. As a result of these revelations, Quistis recognizes that her feelings for Squall are more sisterly than romantic.<ref name="quistislove">'''Quistis:''' "I couldn't stop thinking about Squall. I thought it was... love. I had to hide my feelings because I was an instructor, but I've come to realize it wasn't. It was my childhood feelings as a big sister that lingered... Oh well..." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> Later, she criticizes Squall when he nearly abandons Rinoa, his romantic interest.<ref>'''Quistis:''' "Oh! Stop that! What are you talking about!? Why did you go all the way out into space to save Rinoa!? To hand her over to Esthar!? So that you might never see her again!? No, right!? Wasn't it because you wanted to be with Rinoa? You're a fool." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref>

When designing the characters, Nomura had wanted at least one female character to wear a skirt. Quistis was originally supposed to fill this part, but Nomura decided a long skirt worn over pants would look better. The role was eventually passed to Selphie. Nomura was surprised when the writers cast her as a teacher, despite being around the same age as the rest of the group.<ref name="sheila"/>

I don't know. It's pretty easy. I think it'll be fine. But there's no guarantee it won't crash!" (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref>

Selphie first appears when running into Squall while late for class. She asks Squall to show her around because she recently transferred. During the Dollet exam, Selphie joins Squall's team after Seifer abandons them.<ref>'''Girl:''' "Are you...Squad B? Wait a minute...You're the guy who showed me around, right!? Thanks!

Selphie was the second character that Nomura drew, after Squall, intentionally giving her an impractical hairstyle. When he first designed Selphie, Nomura drew her in overalls; however, he realized that none of the characters would be wearing a skirt. In the end, he gave Selphie a mini-skirt and let Quistis have pants.<ref name="sheila"/> In the ''[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' series, Nomura included a younger version of Selphie as a resident of [[List of worlds in the Kingdom Hearts series#Destiny Islands|Destiny Islands]].<ref name="KingdomHearts">{{cite web | year=2002 | title="Kingdom Hearts (at Square-Enix.com) | url=http://na.square-enix.com/games/kingdomhearts/index1.html | accessdate=2006-08-03}}</ref> In the English versions, she is voiced by [[Molly Keck]].<ref name="IMDB"/>

Seventeen years old,<ref name="Manual6"/> Zell is a [[martial arts|martial artist]]; his weapons are gloves,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://na.square-enix.com/games/ff8/zell.html | title=Final Fantasy VIII Characters - Zell | publisher=SquareEnix.com | accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref> and his Limit Break, ''Duel'', requires the player to input button combinations on the controller to deal damage.<ref name="LimitBreak"/> Zell is slightly impulsive and overconfident in his own skill; however, he is loyal to his friends.<ref name="Manual6"/> Zell is often used as [[comic relief]]; Seifer gives him the nickname "chicken-wuss" and other characters begin using it as well.<ref>'''Squall:''' "...I don't know about that. Perhaps anyone but the Chicken-wuss can make it." / '''Zell:''' "WHAT DID YOU SAYYYYY!!!?" / '''Selphie:''' "...Hm? Since you're so angry, I guess you're the Chicken-wuss." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> He also has a passion for [[hot dog]]s; a recurring gag is that they are always sold out by the time he reaches the cafeteria.

Zell lived at the same orphanage as many of the other protagonists; this is where Seifer first began to bully him. He was later adopted by the Dincht family in the town of Balamb.<ref>'''Zell:''' "I don't care if I forget about my childhood, when Seifer used to pick on me. What's important to me now is having the power to protect my parents in Balamb. They adopted me. There's no way I'm lettin' go of that power!" (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> His motivation for enrolling at Garden is to live up to the memory of his grandfather, a famous soldier.<ref name="Manual6"/>

Zell was designed to look and act like the main character of a [[sh<U+014D>nen]] [[manga]] (Japanese [[comic book]]s intended primarily for boys);<ref name="sheila"/> his neighbors in Balamb describe him as a "'comic-bookish' type of hero".<ref name="battle">{{cite book | year =1999 | editor=BradyGAMES Staff | title=Final Fantasy VIII Official Strategy Guide | pages=16 | publisher = BradyGAMES Publishing | language=English | id = ISBN 1-56686-903-X}}</ref> The inspriration for the tattoo on his face came from an [[MTV]] [[music video]] that featured a man with a [[full body tattoo]].<ref name="sheila"/>

He is one of the Garden's elite sharpshooters,<ref>'''Martine:''' "Don't worry about it. Let me introduce an elite sharpshooter from Galbadia Garden. Kinneas! Irvine Kinneas!"

Sharpshooters are loners by nature... We hone our instincts, pour our whole being into a single bullet. The pressure of the moment... An instant of tension... That's what... I have to face alone... ...It's not easy. So like... Just do me a favor, and let me be! You get my drift?" (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> however, this is merely a fa<U+00E7>ade to hide his lack of confidence.<ref name="choke">'''Irvine:''' "I...I can't...I'm sorry, I can't do it. I always choke like this... I try to act all cool, joke around, but I just can't handle the pressure..." / '''Squall:''' "Forget it. Just shoot." / '''Irvine:''' "My bullet... The sorceress... I'll go down in history. I'd change the history of Galbadia... Of the world! It's all too much..." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref>

When Sorceress Edea becomes the Galbadian ambassador, Balamb and Galbadia Gardens order Squall's team to assassinate her; Irvine is introduced as the sniper for the mission. Moments before the assassination attempt, he explains to Squall that he always chokes under pressure.<ref name="choke"/> At Trabia Garden, Irvine reveals that he and most of the other party members had lived in the same orphanage, run by Cid and Edea Kramer. However, the others could not remember this because of their use of [[Final Fantasy magic#Summoning Magic|Guardian Forces]] (GF), magical beings who cause severe long-term memory loss as a side effect.<ref>'''Squall:''' "...Why is it that we forgot? We grew up together as kids... How's that possible...?" / '''Irvine:''' "How about this? ...The price we pay for using the GF. The GF provides us its power. But the GF makes its own place inside our brain..." / '''Quistis:''' "So you're saying that the area is where our memories are stored? No...! That's just a rumor the GF critics are spreading." / '''Zell:''' "So if we keep relying on the GF, we won't be able to remember a lot of things?" (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> Because Irvine had not used a GF until he joined the party, he is able to remember his past.<ref>'''Irvine:''' "Then how is it that I remember, while everyone else has forgotten? Well...? In my case, I hadn't junctioned a GF until recently. That's why I remember a lot more than you guys." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> During the game, Irvine gradually draws closer to his Selphie,<ref>'''Irvine:''' "Selphie... We're destined to be together!" / '''Selphie:''' "Y-Yeah right...!" / '''Irvine:''' "A sigh of love?"</ref> acting on the feeling he has had since living with her at the orphanage.<ref name="Selvine"/> 

With Irvine, Nomura tried to strike a balance between not overshadowing Squall and not becoming too unattractive. He gave Irvine a handsome appearance, but a casual personality, hoping that this would make him less attractive than Squall. Keeping with this idea, Nomura gave him goggles; however, this idea was abandoned in favor of an American cowboy-like appearance to set him apart from other goggle-wearing characters in the ''Final Fantasy'' series.<ref name="sheila"/>

He fights with [[katar]]s, dual blades attached to his arms, with which he repeatedly slices his enemies in his Limit Break, ''Blood Pain''. His weapons' name is given as "katal" in the English localization of the game. Following the failed mission in Centra, Kiros is separated from Laguna and Ward. He heals quickly and decides to leave the Galbadian army, but soon finds that life without Laguna lacks excitement. His subsequent search for Laguna brings him to Winhill after nearly a year.<ref>'''Kiros:''' "Thank you, for taking care of Laguna. I was able to recover in about a month or so. Ever since then... I've been searching for you." / '''Laguna:''' "Why?" / '''Kiros:''' "After leaving the army... Well, just killing time I guess. Life's pretty boring without you as entertainment, my man." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> When Laguna is forced to leave Winhill to find Ellone, Kiros accompanies him, helping him earn money as an amateur actor to fund the expedition.<ref>'''Laguna:''' "Why the heck do I have to do this!?" / '''Kiros:''' "'Cause we have no money." / '''Ward:''' "......" / '''Laguna:''' "Alright, I'm sorry!!! Yeah, so it's kinda my fault that we stayed at the hotel so often. But heck, I'm not cut out to be an actor!" (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> Kiros remains by Laguna's side throughout his adventures in Esthar, earning a place as Laguna's advisor when he becomes president. Like Ward, Kiros' interactions with Laguna are based on the staff's interactions during development.<ref name="sheila"/>

How you celebrate my ascension with such joy. Hailing the very one you have condemned for generations. Have you no shame? What happened to the evil, ruthless sorceress from your fantasies? The cold-blooded tyrant that slaughtered countless men and destroyed many nations? Where is she now? She stands before your very eyes to become your new ruler. HAHAHAHAHA." / '''President Deling:''' (...?) / '''Edea:''' "A new era has just begun." / '''President Deling:''' "E-Edea... Are you alright...? Ede...!" (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> Her motives are unknown, but SeeD is dispatched to assassinate her. Edea is also the wife of [[#Cid Kramer|Headmaster Cid]],<ref name="CidandEdea">'''Laguna:''' "The owners of the orphanage were Cid Kramer and his wife Edea."

Matron's name is Edea Kramer. Matron IS Sorceress Edea." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> It is eventually revealed that Edea was [[spiritual possession|possessed]] by sorceress from the future named [[#Ultimecia|Ultimecia]].<ref>'''Edea:''' "You are SeeDs. You cannot back out of a battle, I know. You were magnificent. However, it is not over yet. At anytime, I may... ...I have been possessed all this time. I was at the mercy of Sorceress Ultimecia." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> When Ultimecia's control is broken, Edea takes the side of the SeeDs in the struggle and joins the party for a short time. However, she accidentally gives her powers to Rinoa, making her a sorceress.<ref>'''Squall:''' (Ultimecia!? The future sorceress is inside Rinoa!? ...Transferred from Edea? Where's Rinoa!!!?" (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> Being a sorceress, Edea attacks with magical bursts of energy and her Limit Break, ''Ice Strike'', consists of a magically conjured icicle, hurled like a javelin. This Limit Break is depicted in a cutscene during her coronation as head of Galbadia when Ultimecia commands Edea's body to pierce Squall with it.

Edea is one of three character concepts, along with Fujin and Raijin, to have been created before the development of ''Final Fantasy VIII''. Edea had been designed before even the development of ''Final Fantasy VII'', based on the style of [[Yoshitaka Amano]].<ref name="sheila"/>

(''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> After Edea is released from Ultimecia's control, she commands Rinoa to free Adel so she can become Ultimecia's new vessel.<ref>'''Piet:''' "If that's the case, we definitely have to stop her. If she plans to free Adel, she'll have to go out there. The Level 2 Seal is located on Adel's Tomb."

After the failed assassination attempt on Edea, the Garden Master, [[#NORG|NORG]], attempts to seize power from Cid and reconcile with Edea.<ref name="NORGloyalty">'''NORG:''' "Bujurururu! OFFER-THE-SeeD's-HEAD-ON-A-SILVER-PLATTER-AND-PRETEND-WE-OBEY-THE-SORCERESS!"

Afterward, Cid aggressively confronts NORG, who started the conflict over financial issues.<ref>'''Headmaster Cid:''' "Dammit! I should've never trusted you! I wish I could go back ten or so years. To tell myself that you're nothing but a money grubbing son-of-a-bitch! Then I would've never built this place." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> Cid is the husband of Sorceress Edea, with whom he ran an orphanage and founded the SeeD organization. They are estranged for most of the game, however, because they lead opposing factions until Ultimecia releases her magical possession of Edea. 

Because most ''Final Fantasy'' titles include a character named "Cid", Nomura wanted to design someone with differences from the past Cids in the series. He gave this version of Cid the appearance and personality of an older, benevolent character who would watch over Squall's party and offer them advice and motivation. Nojima decided that this type of good-natured character would work best as the headmaster of Balamb Garden.<ref name="sheila"/>

===Ellone===

She uses this talent to send Squall's party into Laguna's past adventures, hoping that they would alter the past; however, she eventually realizes that not even her abilities can change history.<ref>'''Ellone:''' "You can't change the past.

I can no longer make it back to that moment... And also... I can only send you inside someone I've met before." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> Ultimecia needs this power to achieve time compression, so she uses the Galbadian military to find her.<ref name="Ultimecia">'''Edea:''' "Ultimecia's objective is to find Ellone." / '''Edea:''' "Ellone's mysterious power...

She is a member of Balamb Garden's disciplinary committee with Seifer and Raijin; the three of them form a close "posse",<ref name="Posse1"/> even when Seifer leaves SeeD. Fujin prefers to speak in terse sentences, often with only a single word (such as "RAGE!" and "LIES!"). However, near the end of the game, she eloquently explains to Squall that she will temporarily break ties with Seifer because of his recent behavior.<ref name="Fujinspeech">'''Fujin:''' "POSSE... We are. We always will be. Because we're a posse, we want to help you. Whatever it takes to fulfill your dream, we're willing to do. But... You're being manipulated, Seifer.

Because she operates through the body of Edea Kramer, her role is not discovered until late in the game. While possessing Edea, Ultimecia gains control of Galbadia and later possesses Rinoa to release [[#Adel|Sorceress Adel]] from her [[orbit]]al prison.

That's bad... Really BAD!" / '''General Caraway:''' "Yes, indeed. It's a serious problem. But it doesn't concern you. It's our problem." {''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> However, he later arranges her freedom from the D-District Prison.

He and his wife, '''Flo''', detest violence and oppose the Garden's presence in his territory.<ref>'''Mayor Dobe:''' "We don't want military organizations in FH. You rely on force to solve problems.

'''Raine''' is Laguna's second love depicted in the flashbacks. She finds him injured at the bottom of a cliff and brings him to her hometown of Winhill to recover.

He was carried in here crying like a baby, and I was the one who had to take care of him... His crude way of speaking... I don't know if his aspirations as a journalist are going to come true...

===Martine===
'''Martine''' is the head of Galbadia Garden. His superior, Balamb Garden's master NORG, orders him to use SeeD members to carry out the assassination plot against Sorceress Edea. When Squall and his team travel to Galbadia Garden after fleeing Timber, Martine orders the them to carry out the mission. He hopes that using Balamb Garden's SeeDs would deflect responsibility for the plot onto NORG.<ref>'''NORG:''' "Bujurururu! THAT-SLY-WEASEL-MARTINE-USED-YOU-AS-A-LAST-RESORT-FOR-THE-ASSASSINATION. HE-GAVE-THAT-ORDER-TO-PLACE-THE-BLAME-ON-ME! THAT-THAT-BASTARD."

She also helps Headmaster Cid after his confrontation with NORG. '''Nida''' is a student at Balamb Garden who passes the SeeD exam along with Squall.

I can't believe you forgot!" / '''Squall:''' "Oh yeah..." / '''Nida:''' "Gee... Well, it's just like you to forget. By the way, you know how the FH technicians were fixing the Garden, right? They just finished. Meaning... The Garden's ready to go anytime. Oh yeah. I'll be piloting the Garden. FH technicians taught me everything about piloting this thing. Let me know when you want to go." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> Lastly, '''Xu''' is a high ranking SeeD who helps Squall during the Dollet mission and the Garden civil war between NORG and Cid.<ref>'''Squall:''' "Where is [Headmaster Cid]?" / '''Xu:''' "In his office.

===NORG===
[[Image:NORG.jpg|right|100px|NORG, as depicted in the game]]
'''NORG''' is an exiled [[Races of Final Fantasy#Shumi|Shumi]] who lent Cid the money to build and develop the Garden and took the position of Garden Master upon its completion.<ref name="NORGhistory1">'''Headmaster Cid:''' "He is from the Shumi tribe. A black sheep of the tribe, one might say. We met while I was running around trying to find funds to build the Garden. He became interested in building the Garden, and we hit it off. Thanks to his funding, it was completed. However, we needed an enormous amount of funds to run the Garden. So we began dispatching SeeDs around the world as a means of supporting the Garden. NORG's idea was right on the money. An enormous amount of capital began flowing into the Garden. And the Garden began to change. Lost sight of our high ideals, the truth was covered up... That's probably enough. In the end, it was my fault, for giving up control." (''Final Fantasy VIII'')</ref> NORG is more concerned about the revenue acquired by SeeD as a mercenary organization rather than its noble duty of opposing the Sorceress; he is considered a "black sheep" of the Shumi tribe.<ref name="NORGhistory1"/> After hearing about a failed assassination attempt on Sorceress Edea, NORG begins to distrust Headmaster Cid and tries to seize control of Balamb Garden, causing a conflict between factions loyal to NORG and Cid. Feigning loyalty to the Sorceress, he attempts to kill the SeeDs who carried out the failed assassination.<ref name="NORGloyalty"/> After he is defeated in battle, he enters a [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon-like]] state.

===Reception and criticism===
The characters of ''Final Fantasy VIII'' have received praise by reviewers. The ''Gaming Age'' reviewer was originally concerned with the shift to consistently realistically proportioned characters, but he ultimately found them more appealing.<ref name="gamingage">{{cite web | author=McTague, Bob | year=1999 | title=Gaming Age Review - ''Final Fantasy VIII'' | url=http://www.gaming-age.com/reviews/archive/old_reviews/psx/ff8/ | work=[http://www.gaming-age.com/ Gaming Age] | accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref> Moreover, the review stated that the character designs and graphical quality allowed the characters to "convey emotions much more dramatically".<ref name="gamingage"/> ''Game Revolution'' cited similar praise, agreeing that the change "really makes the graphics impressive".<ref name="gamerevolution">{{cite web | author=Liu, Johnny | year=1999 | title=Game Revolution Review Page - ''Final Fantasy VIII'' | url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/oldsite/games/sony/rpg/final_fantasy_8.htm | work=[http://www.gamerevolution.com/ Game Revolution] | accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref> [[IGN]] commented that the "low-polygon characters of FFVII are gone, replaced with sometimes surprisingly realistic high-polygon models that only look better the closer they get".<ref name="ignreview">{{cite web | author=Lundigran, Jeff | year=1999 | title=IGN: Final Fantasy VIII Review | url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/153/153847p1.html | work=[http://www.ign.com/ IGN] | accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref> [[GameSpot]] agreed with the transition, claiming that "involving, personal, and emotional stories are far more believable when they come from, well, people, not short, bizarrely shaped cartoon characters".<ref name="gamespot">{{cite web | author=Vestal, Andrew | year=1999 | title=Final Fantasy VIII for PlayStation Review | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/finalfantasy8/review.html | work=[http://www.gamespot.com/ GameSpot] | accessdate=2006-07-13}}</ref>

The cast itself has received criticism from reviews. IGN criticized the manner in which romantic interactions play out, stating that "considering that the love story is so integral to everything that happens <U+2014> not to mention forming the central image of the box art <U+2014> it's incomprehensible why no one says "I love you" to anyone, ever."<ref name="ignreview"/> With Squall, IGN felt that "FFVIII does break one cardinal rule: when your story is character centered, you'd better center it on a character the audience can care about. Squall, unfortunately, just doesn't fit the bill".<ref name="ignreview"/> However, [[GameSpot]] felt that ''Final Fantasy VIII'' shifts the story from the "epic" concepts of ''Final Fantasy VII'' to the "personal", in that "the characters and their relationships are all extremely believable and complex; moreover, the core romance holds up even under the most pessimistic scrutiny".<ref name="gamespot"/> Although the reviewer at ''[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]]'' agnowledged possible fears over a romantic storyline, he stated that "it's only later in the game, once you are really attached to all the distinct and complex characters, that the more emotional themes are gradually introduced".<ref name="egmreview">{{cite web | author=MacDonald, Mark | date=October 1999| title=Final Fantasy VIII PS Review | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zdoup/is_199910/ai_ziff119200 | publisher=[[Ziff Davis Media]] | accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>
