'''Mumia Abu-Jamal''' ({{pronEng|mu<U+02D0>mi<U+0251><U+02D0> <U+0259>bu<U+02D0> d<U+0292><U+0259><U+02C8>m<U+0251><U+02D0>l}}; born '''Wesley Cook''' on [[April 24]], [[1954]]) was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1981 murder of police officer [[Daniel Faulkner]]<ref>''Commonwealth v. Abu-Jamal'', Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas, First Judicial District, Philadelphia, Case Nos. 1357-59.</ref>, and is currently a prisoner at State Correctional Institution Greene near [[Waynesburg, Pennsylvania]].

In December 2001, a judge of the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania]] affirmed his conviction but quashed the original punishment and ordered resentencing. Both Abu-Jamal and the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] appealed. The case was orally argued before a three-judge panel in the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]], [[Philadelphia]] on [[May 17]], [[2007]], and as of February 2008 is pending.<ref>See General Docket, ''Abu-Jamal v.

Prior to his arrest he was a [[Black Panther Party]] activist, part-time cab driver, and journalist. During his imprisonment he has courted controversy as an honoree of municipal, educational and civil society organizations, and as a spoken word commentator and published author of several works<U+2014>most notably ''[[Live from Death Row]]''.

=== Involvement with the Black Panthers ===
[[Image:Bpp logo.jpg|thumb|left|Black Panther Party logo]] In his own writings, Abu-Jamal describes his adolescent experience of being "kicked&nbsp;... into the Black Panther Party" after suffering a beating from white racists and a policeman for his efforts to disrupt a [[George Wallace#Independent American Party presidential candidate|George Wallace for President]] rally in 1968.<ref>{{cite book|author=Abu-Jamal, Mumia|year=1996|title=Live From Death Row|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York|pages=p.151|isbn=0-380-72766-8}}</ref> The following year he helped form the Philadelphia branch of the [[Black Panther Party]],<ref name="bur1">{{cite web | last=Burroughs | first=Todd Steven | title=Part I: "Do Something, Nigger!" | work=Ready to Party: Mumia Abu-Jamal and the Black Panther Party | publisher=The College of New Jersey | date=2004 | url=http://www.tcnj.edu/~kpearson/Mumia/part1.htm | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> taking appointment, in his own words, as the chapter's "Lieutenant of Information", exercising a responsibility for authoring propaganda and news communications.

==Arrest for murder and trial==
{{main|Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Mumia Abu-Jamal}}
[[Image:Daniel faulkner.jpg|right|thumb|Daniel Faulkner]] 
On [[December 9]], [[1981]], [[Philadelphia Police Department]] officer [[Daniel Faulkner]] was shot and killed during a routine traffic stop of a vehicle driven by [[William Cook (street vendor)|William Cook]], Abu-Jamal's younger brother. In the altercation Abu-Jamal was wounded by a shot from Faulkner, and collapsed on the sidewalk. He was taken directly from the scene of the shooting to [[Thomas Jefferson University Hospital]] and received treatment for his injuries. He was later charged with the [[first-degree murder]] of Daniel Faulkner.<ref name="tr">{{cite web | title=Trial and Post-Conviction Relief Act (PCRA) hearing transcripts | publisher=Commonwealth of Pennsylvania | url=http://www.danielfaulkner.com/docs/MumiaTrialandPCRAAppealsTranscripts.pdf | format=pdf | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> 

The case went to trial in June 1982 in Philadelphia. Judge [[Albert F. Sabo]] initially agreed to Abu-Jamal's request to represent himself, with criminal defense attorney Anthony Jackson acting as his legal advisor. During the first day of the trial this decision was reversed and Jackson was ordered to resume acting as Abu-Jamal's sole advocate by reason of what the judge deemed to be intentionally disruptive actions on Abu-Jamal's part.<ref>{{cite web | title=Trial transcript <U+00A7>1.72<U+2013><U+00A7>1.73 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[June 17]], [[1982]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/6-17-82.html | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> 

===Prosecution case at trial===
The prosecution presented four witnesses to the court.
Robert Chobert, a cab driver, identified Abu-Jamal as the shooter.<ref>{{cite web | title=Trial transcript <U+00A7>3.210<U+2013><U+00A7>3.211 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[June 19]], [[1982]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/6-19-82.html#chobert | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> Cynthia White, a prostitute, claimed to see a man emerge from a nearby parking lot and shoot Faulkner.<ref>{{cite web | title=Trial transcript pp.94<U+2013>95 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[June 21]], [[1982]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/6-21-82.html#white | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> Michael Scanlon, a motorist, testified that he saw a man run across the street from a parking lot and shoot Faulkner.<ref>{{cite web | title=Trial transcript pp.5<U+2013>75 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[June 25]], [[1982]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/6-25-82.html#scanlan | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> Albert Magilton, a pedestrian who did not see the actual killing, testified to witnessing Faulkner pull over Cook's car.

The prosecution also presented two witnesses who were present at the hospital after the altercation. Hospital security guard Priscilla Durham and Police Officer Garry Bell testified that Abu-Jamal confessed in the hospital by saying, "I shot the mother fucker, and I hope the mother fucker dies."<ref>{{cite web | title=Trial transcript pp.29, 31, 34, 137, 162 and 164 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[June 24]], [[1982]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/6-24-82.html | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> 

A [[.38 Special|.38 caliber]] revolver, belonging to Abu-Jamal, with five spent cartridges was retrieved at the scene. The shell casings and rifling characteristics of the weapon were consistent with bullet fragments taken from Faulkner's body.<ref>{{cite web | title=Trial transcript p.169 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[June 23]], [[1982]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/6-23-82.html#paul | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> Tests to confirm Abu-Jamal had handled and fired the weapon were not performed; Abu-Jamal's struggle with the police during his arrest would have made the potential results scientifically unreliable.<ref>{{cite web | title=PCRA hearing transcript, pp.118<U+2013>122 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, First Judicial District of Pennsylvania, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[August 2]], [[1995]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/pcra/95-08-02.html | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref>

===Defense case at trial===
The defense maintained that Abu-Jamal was innocent of the charges and that the testimony of the prosecution's witnesses was unreliable.

The defense presented nine character witnesses, including poet [[Sonia Sanchez]] who testified that Abu-Jamal was "viewed by the black community as a creative, articulate, peaceful, genial man".<ref>{{cite web | title=Trial transcript p.19 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[June 30]], [[1982]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/6-30-82.html#sanchez | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> Another defense witness, Dessie Hightower, testified that he saw a man running along the street shortly after the shooting.<ref>{{cite web | title=Trial transcript p.127 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[June 28]], [[1982]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/6-28-82.html | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> This became known as the "running man theory", based on the possibility that a "running man" may have been the actual shooter. Veronica Jones also testified for the defense but she did not see anyone running.<ref>{{cite web | title=Trial transcript pp.99<U+2013>100 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[June 29]], [[1982]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/6-29-82.html#jones | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> Other potential defense witnesses refused to appear in court.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/5-25-83.html | title=Post-Trial Motions transcript p.29 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, First Judicial District of Pennsylvania, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[May 25]], [[1983]] | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> Abu-Jamal did not testify in his own defense.

===Verdict and sentence===
The jury delivered a unanimous guilty verdict after three hours of deliberations. 

In the sentencing phase of the trial, Abu-Jamal read to the jury from a prepared statement. He was then sworn-in and cross-examined about issues relevant to the assessment of his character by Joseph McGill, the prosecuting attorney.<ref>{{cite web | title=Trial transcript, pp.3<U+2013>34 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Please, Philadelphia Criminal Trial Division | date=[[July 3]], [[1982]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/7-3-82.html | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> In his statement Abu-Jamal criticized his attorney as a "legal trained lawyer" who was imposed on him against his will and who "knew he was inadequate to the task and chose to follow the directions of this black-robed conspirator, [Judge] Albert Sabo, even if it meant ignoring my directions". He claimed that his rights had been "deceitfully stolen" from him by the judge, particularly focusing on the denial of his request to receive [[McKenzie friend]] assistance from [[John Africa]] and being prevented from proceeding ''[[pro se]]''. He quoted remarks of John Africa and declared himself "innocent of these charges".<ref>{{cite web | title=Trial transcript, pp.10<U+2013>16 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Please, Philadelphia Criminal Trial Division | date=[[July 3]], [[1982]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/7-3-82.html | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref>

Abu-Jamal was subsequently sentenced to death by the unanimous decision of the jury.<ref>{{cite web | title=Trial transcript, pp.100<U+2013>103 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Please, Philadelphia Criminal Trial Division | date=[[July 3]], [[1982]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/7-3-82.html | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref>

===Post-trial developments===
Since the sentence, new information which contradicts the trial evidence has surfaced.  

In 1999, [[Arnold Beverly]] claimed that, "wearing a green (camouflage) army jacket", he had run across the street and shot Daniel Faulkner as part of a contract killing because Faulkner was interfering with graft and payoff to corrupt police.<ref>{{cite web | last=Beverly | first=Arnold | title=Affidavit of Arnold Beverly | publisher=Free Mumia Coalition | date=[[June 8]], [[1999]] | url=http://www.freemumia.com/beverlydeclaration.html | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> Private investigator George Newman claimed in 2001 that Chobert had recanted his testimony.<ref>{{Citation | last=Newman | first=George Michael | title=Affidavit of George Michael Newman | publisher=Free Mumia Coalition | date=[[September 25]], [[2001]] | url=http://www.freemumia.com/newmandeclaration.html | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> Cynthia White died in 1992,<ref>{{Cite web | title=PCRA hearing transcript p.144 | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, First Judicial District of Pennsylvania, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[June 26]], [[1997]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/pcra/97-06-26.html | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> before being able to respond to claims that she falsified her testimony.<ref>{{Citation | last=Williams | first=Yvette | title=Declaration of Yvette Williams | publisher=Free Mumia Coalition | date=[[January 28]], [[2002]] | url=http://www.mumia.de/doc/aktuell/20020227mde01en.html | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> Kenneth Pate, a step-brother of Priscilla Durham who was imprisoned with Abu-Jamal on other charges, has since claimed that Durham admitted to not hearing the hospital confession.<ref>{{cite web | last=Pate | first=Kenneth | title=Declaration of Kenneth Pate | publisher=Free Mumia Coalition | date=[[April 18]], [[2003]] | url=http://www.mumia.de/doc/aktuell/20030510mde00en.html | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> The hospital doctors have claimed that Abu-Jamal was not capable of making such a dramatic bedside confession at that time.<ref name="guardian"/> 

In his version of events, detailed in a sworn statement almost 20 years afterwards, Abu-Jamal claimed that he was sitting in his cab across the street when he heard shouting, then saw a police vehicle, then heard the sound of gunshots. Upon seeing his brother appearing disoriented across the street, Abu-Jamal ran to him from the parking lot and was shot by a police officer.

[[William H. Yohn, Jr.|Judge William H. Yohn Jr.]] of the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania]] upheld the conviction but voided the sentence of death on [[December 18]], [[2001]], citing irregularities in the original process of sentencing.<ref name="yn"/> Particularly,<blockquote>"...the jury instructions and verdict sheet in this case involved an unreasonable application of federal law. The charge and verdict form created a reasonable likelihood that the jury believed it was precluded from considering any mitigating circumstance that had not been found unanimously to exist."<ref name = "yn"/></blockquote> He ordered the State of Pennsylvania to commence new sentencing proceedings within 180 days<ref>{{cite news | title =Abu-Jamal's death sentence overturned | publisher =[[BBC News]] | date =[[December 18]], [[2001]] | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1718274.stm | accessdate =2008-01-22}}</ref> and ruled that it was [[unconstitutional]] to require that a jury's finding of circumstances mitigating against determining a sentence of death be unanimous.<ref>See p.70 of the July 2006 appeal brief for Mumia Abu-Jamal before the US Court of Appeal citing the ruling of Judge Yohn in the US District Court, the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], and the [[United States Supreme Court]] [[precedent]] of ''Mills v.

=== 2005 Federal higher appeal ===
On [[December 6]], [[2005]], the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] admitted four issues for appeal of the ruling of the District Court:<ref>{{cite news | last=Lindorff | first=Dave | title=A victory for Mumia | publisher=[[Salon.com]] | date=[[December 8]], [[2005]] | url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/12/08/mumia/index.html | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref>
* in relation to sentencing, whether the jury verdict form had been flawed and the judge's instructions to the jury had been confusing; 
* in relation to conviction and sentencing, whether racial bias in [[jury selection]] existed to an extent tending to produce an inherently biased jury and therefore an unfair trial (the ''[[Batson v. Kentucky|Batson]]'' claim); 
* in relation to conviction, whether the prosecutor improperly attempted to reduce jurors' sense of responsibility by telling them that a guilty verdict would be subsequently vetted and subject to appeal;
* in relation to post-conviction review hearings in 1995<U+2013>6, whether the presiding judge<U+2014>who had also presided at the trial<U+2014>demonstrated unacceptable bias in his conduct. 

The Third Circuit Court heard oral arguments in the appeals on [[May 17]], [[2007]], at the United States Courthouse in Philadelphia. The appeal panel consisted of Chief Judge [[Anthony Joseph Scirica]], Judge [[Thomas L. Ambro|Thomas Ambro]], and Judge [[Robert E. Cowen|Robert Cowen]]. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania sought to reinstate the sentence of death, on the basis that Yohn's ruling was flawed, as he should have deferred to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court which had already ruled on the issue of sentencing, and the ''Batson'' claim was invalid because Abu-Jamal made no complaints during the original jury selection. Abu-Jamal's counsel told the Third Circuit Court that Abu-Jamal did not get a fair trial because the jury was both racially-biased and misinformed, and the judge was a racist.<ref>{{cite web | last=Duffy | first=Shannon P. | title=Spectators Pack Courtroom as 3rd Circuit Hears Appeal in Mumia Abu-Jamal Case | publisher=The Legal Intelligencer | date=[[May 18]], [[2007]] | url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1179392702456 | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> (Court stenographer Terri Maurer-Carter stated in a 2001 affidavit that the presiding judge had exclaimed, "Yeah, and I'm going to help them fry the nigger", in the course of a conversation regarding Abu-Jamal's case.<ref>{{cite web | last=Maurer-Carter | first=Terri | title=Declaration of Terri Maurer-Carter | publisher=Free Mumia Coalition | date=[[August 21]], [[2001]] | url=http://www.mumia.de/doc/aktuell/20010903mde02en.html | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Bryan | first=Robert R. | coauthors=Judith L.

Subsequent to the airing of the 1996 [[HBO]] documentary ''Mumia Abu-Jamal: A Case for Reasonable Doubt?'', which included footage from visitation interviews conducted with him, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections acted to ban outsiders from using any recording equipment in state prisons.<ref name = "tsb"/> In litigation before the US Court of Appeals in 1998 he successfully established his right to write for reward in prison.
