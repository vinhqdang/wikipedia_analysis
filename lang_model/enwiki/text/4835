"'''Lisa the Skeptic'''" is the eighth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 9)|ninth season]], first aired on November 23, 1997.  On an [[Archaeology|archaeological]] dig with her class, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] discovers a skeleton that resembles an [[angel]].  All of the townspeople believe that the skeleton actually came from an angel, but [[skepticism|skeptical]] Lisa attempts to persuade them that there must be a [[rational skepticism|rational scientific]] explanation. The episode's writer [[David X. Cohen]] developed the idea after visiting the [[American Museum of Natural History]], and decided to loosely parallel themes from the [[Scopes Trial|Scopes Monkey Trial]].  There were mixed reviews.

It has been discussed in the context of [[virtual reality]], [[ontology]], [[existentialism]], and skepticism; it has also been used in Christian religious education classes to initiate discussion about angels, skepticism, science, and faith.

==Plot==
[[Homer Simpson|Homer]] attempts to claim a [[motorboat]] from a "police raffle" that turns out to be a [[sting operation]]. While returning home, the family passes a new mall in Springfield is being built on an area where a large number of [[fossil]]s were found. Lisa protests strongly, which prompts the school to conduct an archaeological dig. During the excavations, Lisa finds a human skeleton with wings. Springfield's residents are convinced it is an angel, and Homer cashes in by moving the skeleton into the family's garage. Lisa remains skeptical, and asks [[Stephen Jay Gould]] to test a sample. When Dr. Gould appears at the Simpson house the next day to tell Lisa that the tests were inconclusive, Lisa goes on [[television|TV]] to compare the belief in angels to the belief in [[unicorn]]s and [[leprechaun]]s (news anchor Brockman states that leprechauns are extinct). In response, Springfield's religious zealots go on a rampage to destroy all scientific institutions (including, ironically, a [[Christian Science]] library). Appalled by the violence, Lisa goes into the garage to destroy the skeleton, but finds that it has disappeared. The mob soon converges on the Simpson household, and Lisa is promptly arrested and put on trial for stealing the skeleton.

Before the trial begins, the courtroom's attention is diverted when the skeleton appears outside, carrying a foreboding message that "[[Apocalypse|The End]]" will come at sundown. Meanwhile, [[List of recurring characters from the Simpsons#Judge Roy Snyder|Judge Snyder]] issues a [[injunction|restraining order]] to keep science and religion {{convert|500|yd|m}} apart at all times. Sundown approaches, and Springfield's citizens are frightened, but nothing catastrophic occurs. As Lisa starts to reprimand them, the skeleton suddenly silences her and yells "Prepare for the end... the end of high prices!" and is hoisted over to the entrance of the new discount mall. Lisa realizes that the "end is near" saga was a publicity stunt for the mall, exploiting people's deepest beliefs, and she calls for a [[boycott]] of the mall. The bargain-loving public ignore Lisa, and go shopping. Dr. Gould confesses that he did not actually do any testing. [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] says that, for a few seconds while it was rising, Lisa believed the angel was real. Lisa denies this, but admits she was frightened and thanks her mother for her support.

"Lisa the Skeptic" was written by [[David X. Cohen]], and directed by [[Neil Affleck]].<ref name="alberti">{{cite book | last =Alberti | first =John |   title =[[Leaving Springfield|Leaving Springfield: The Simpsons and the Possibility of Oppositional Culture]]| publisher =[[Wayne State University|Wayne State University Press]] | year =2004 |  pages =305, 320 | isbn = 0-8143-2849-0}}</ref>  Cohen was inspired to write the episode after a trip to [[Manhattan]]'s [[American Museum of Natural History]], where he decided to turn the visit into a "business trip", and think of a possible episode connection to the museum.<ref name="Cohen">{{cite video | people=Cohen, David S. |date=2006|title=The Simpsons season 9 DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa the Skeptic"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>  He initially wanted Lisa to find a "[[transitional fossil|missing link]]" skeleton, and do an episode reminiscent of the [[Scopes Trial|Scopes Monkey Trial]].<ref name="Cohen" /> Writer [[George Meyer]] convinced him instead to have the focus be on an angel skeleton, while keeping an emphasis on the [[Relationship between religion and science|conflict between religion and science]].<ref name="Cohen" /> Both Cohen and Meyer acknowledged how silly the "angel skeleton" idea was owing to simple questions raised such as why an angel died and why bones were left behind, but they went forward with the idea anyway.<ref name="Cohen" />

In an early draft of the script, the skeleton was made of baked pasty dough, baked by the mall's window dresser.<ref name="Cohen" />  Cohen had initially written the Stephen Jay Gould role as a generic scientist or [[paleontology|paleontologist]], not knowing that they would eventually get Gould. He had taken Gould's Introduction to Paleontology class at [[Harvard University]].<ref name="Cohen" />  The only phrase Gould had objected to in the script was a line that introduced him as the "world's most brilliant paleontologist."<ref name="Scully">{{cite video | people=Scully, Mike |date=2006|title=The Simpsons season 9 DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa the Skeptic"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>  His original final line was "I didn't do the test. I had more important work to do" but was cut because the writers felt it would be better to give him a short final line. Also, some thought it was too mean.<ref name="Cohen" />  In an earlier version of the episode, Marge would have ended up apologizing to Lisa for not supporting her, letting the ending be more of a nod to Lisa's correct assumptions all along.<ref name="Cohen" />

Author Joley Wood compared "Lisa the Skeptic" to an [[alternate reality game]], in analyzing the effects of watching the television program ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' on contemporary culture and our own perceptions of reality.<ref>{{cite book | last =Wood | first =Joley |   title =Living Lost: Why We're All Stuck on the Island | publisher =Garrett County Press | year =2006 |   id =   | isbn = 1-891053-02-7 |  page =12}}</ref>  Dan O'Brien cited the episode in a discussion of [[ontology]], skepticism, and religious faith, in his book ''An Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge''.<ref name="obrien">{{cite book | last =O'Brien | first =Dan |   title =An Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge | publisher =Polity | year =2006 |   id =  | isbn = 0-7456-3316-1 |  page =189}}</ref>  O'Brien leaves it up to the reader to decide whether or not Lisa was justified in her skepticism.<ref name="obrien" />  In ''[[The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer]]'', "Lisa the Skeptic" is cited as a prime example of why Lisa is seen as the epitome of a [[nerd]].<ref name="irwin">{{cite book | last = Irwin | first = William |  coauthors = Aeon J.

In their 2010 book ''The Simpsons in the Classroom'', Karma Waltonen and Denise Du Vernay note that the episode is one of the best for teachers and professors to use in religion or cultural studies courses, noting the irony that though Lisa is the only skeptic through most of the episode, she is the only one who is offended at the publicity stunt.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Simpsons In The Classroom: Embiggening the Learning Experience with the Wisdom of Springfield|page=12|author=Du Vernay, Denise; Waltonen, Karma|publisher=McFarland|year=2010|isbn=0-7864-4490-8}}</ref> Parvin's ''The Gospel According to the Simpsons: Leader's Guide for Group Study'' is a group study guide companion to Pinsky's ''The Gospel According to the Simpsons.''<ref name="parvin">{{cite book  | last = Parvin | first = Samuel F. | coauthors = Mark I.

The scene in Judge Snyder's courtroom where Lisa is put on trial for stealing the skeleton is seen as a reference to the 1920s [[Scopes Trial|Scopes Monkey Trial]] in [[Dayton, Tennessee]], which dealt with issues of [[separation of church and state]] and the debate between [[creationism]] and [[evolution]].<ref name="pinsky">{{cite book | last =Pinsky | first =Mark I. |  coauthors =Tony Campolo | title =The Gospel According to the Simpsons: The Spiritual Life of the World's Most Animated Family | publisher =Westminster John Knox Press | year =2001 |  pages =43, 133, 182 |   id =   | isbn =0-664-22419-9 }}</ref>  The publicity stunt created by the mall developers in the episode has been compared to scientific [[hoax]]es such as the [[Cardiff Giant]] and the [[Piltdown Man]].<ref name="pinsky" />  When Lisa asks if the townspeople are outraged at the end of the episode for being fooled by a publicity stunt, [[Chief Wiggum]] is about to answer her but is distracted when he catches sight of a [[Pottery Barn]] in the new Heavenly Hills mall.<ref name="turner" /> A shot of the diggers in [[silhouette]] against the [[sunset]] is modeled after ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981).<ref name="ult">{{cite book|title=[[Simpsons World The Ultimate Episode Guide: Seasons 1<U+2013>20]]|publisher=[[HarperCollins|Harper Collins Publishers]]|year=2010|editor=Bates, James W.; Gimple, Scott M.; McCann, Jesse L., Richmond, Ray; Seghers, Christine|isbn=978-0-00-738815-8|edition=1st|page=430}}</ref>
