Within the work of the Austrian psychoanalyst [[Wilhelm Reich]] (1897<U+2013>1957), '''orgastic potency''' is the ability to experience an [[orgasm]] with specific [[Psychology|psycho]][[somatic]] characteristics and, among others, requiring the ability to love.<ref>"Reich's account of the ideal sexual act is remarkable both for its explicitness, which must have required courage in the pre-Kinsey, pre-Masters and Johnson era in which it was written, and for its omission of the word 'love'. And yet it is clear that it is love that he is talking about. Orgastic potency as formulated by Reich is the capacity to love body and soul, psychosomatically."{{harvnb|Rycroft|1971}}: 33.

(2003) ''Wilhelm Reich: Psychoanalyist and Radical Naturalist'', New York: Farrar Straus and Giroux, p. 88.: "The coda to the entire argument of ''Genitality'' was sounded in two striking sentences: 'Satisfied genital object love is thus [the justified aim] of our therapeutic efforts.'" </ref>

For Reich, "orgastic impotence," or failure to attain orgastic potency (not to be confused with [[anorgasmia]], the inability to reach orgasm) always resulted in [[neurosis]], because during orgasm that person could not discharge all [[libido]] (which Reich regarded as a biological energy). According to Reich, "not a single neurotic individual possesses orgastic potency."<ref>Gabriel, Yiannis. ''Freud and Society''. Routledge, 1983, [http://books.google.com/books?id=suI9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA178 p. 178].</ref>

Reich coined the term ''orgastic impotence'' in 1924 and described the concept in his 1927 book ''[[Genitality in the Theory and Therapy of Neurosis|Die Funktion des Orgasmus]]'', the manuscript of which he presented to [[Sigmund Freud]] on the latter's 70th birthday.<ref>{{harvnb|Sharaf|1994}}: 91-2, 100, 116.</ref> Though Reich regarded his work as complementing Freud's original theory of anxiety neurosis, Freud was ambivalent in his reception.<ref>{{harvnb|Sharaf|1994}}: 100<U+2013>101.</ref> Freud's view was that there was no single cause of neurosis.<ref name=Freudletter>[http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=ipl.089.0174a "Letter from Freud to Lou Andreas-Salom<U+00E9>, May 9, 1928"], The International Psycho-Analytical Library, 89:174-175.</ref>

Reich continued to use the concept as an indicator of a person's health in his later therapeutic methods, such as [[vegetotherapy]].<ref name="Sharaf 1994 238-41, 243"/> During the period 1933<U+2013>1937, he attempted to ground his orgasm theory in physiology, both theoretically and experimentally.<ref name="Boadella 1985">{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 102, 135.</ref>

==Background==
[[File:Wilhelm Reich, Wilhelm Reich Museum.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Wilhelm Reich]]]]
Reich developed his orgasm theory between 1921 and 1924 and it formed the basis for all his later contributions, including the theory of [[Character Analysis|character analysis]].<ref>{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 23.</ref> The starting point of Reich's orgasm theory was his clinical observation of genital disturbance in all neurotics,<ref name="Sharaf 1994 86-105">{{harvnb|Sharaf|1994}}: 86-105.</ref> which he presented in November 1923, in the paper "<U+00DC>ber Genitalit<U+00E4>t vom Standpunkt der psychoanalytischen Prognose und Therapie" ("Genitality from the viewpoint of psycho-analytic prognosis and therapy"). That presentation was met with a chilling silence, much hostility, and was partially discredited because Reich could not adequately define normal sexual health. In response, and after a further year of research, Reich introduced the concept "orgastic potency" at the 1924 Psycho-analytic Congress, Salzburg in the paper "Die therapeutische Bedeutung des Genitallibidos" ("Further Remarks on the Therapeutic Significance of Genital Libido").<ref>{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 16.</ref>

In addition to his own patients' love lives, Reich examined through interviews and case records those of 200 patients seen at the Vienna Psychoanalytic Polyclinic. Reich was impressed by the depth and frequency of genital disturbances he observed. One example was a patient who had reported having a normal sex life, but on closer interviewing by Reich revealed not experiencing orgasm during intercourse and having thoughts of murdering her partner following the act. Such observations made Reich very suspicious of superficial reports about sexual experience.<ref name="Sharaf 1994 86-105"/> His analysis of these cases led Reich to conclude that genital disturbance was present in all neuroses and correlated in severity to the severity of the neurosis, and that all patients who improved in therapy and remained symptom-free achieved a gratifying genital sex life.<ref name="Sharaf 1994 86-105"/><ref name="Raknes 1944">{{harvnb|Raknes|1944}}.</ref> This led Reich to establish criteria for satisfactory sexual intercourse. Based on interviews with people who appeared to have satisfactory sex lives, he described the sex act as being optimally satisfactory only if it follows a specific pattern.<ref name="Sharaf 1994 86-105"/><ref name="Raknes 1944"/> Orgastic potency is Reich's term for the ability to have this maximally fulfilling type of sexual experience, which in the Reichian view is limited to those who are free from neuroses and appears to be shared by all people free of neuroses.<ref name="Raknes 1944"/>

==Definition ==
Reich's precise definition for the phrase "orgastic potency" changed over time as he changed his understanding of the phenomenon. He first described it in detail in his 1927 book ''Die Funktion Des Orgasmus.'' In the 1980 English translation of the book, ''Genitality in the Theory and Therapy of Neuroses'', he defined orgastic potency as "the ability to achieve full resolution of existing sexual need-tension".<ref>{{harvnb|Reich|1980}}: 18.</ref> 

In his 1940 book ''Die Entdeckung des Orgons Erster Teil: Die Function des Orgasmus'', published in English in 1942 as ''The Discovery of the Orgone, Volume 1: The Function of the Orgasm'', he defined it as "the capacity to surrender to the flow of biological energy, free of any inhibitions; the capacity to discharge completely the dammed-up sexual excitation through involuntary, pleasurable convulsions of the body."<ref>{{harvnb|Reich|1999}}: 102. Note: the original reads "damned-up" but this is probably a typo.</ref>

His last published definition of orgastic potency, which is part of his 1960 published ''Selected Writings'', is "the capacity for complete surrender to the involuntary convulsion of the organism and complete discharge of the excitation at the acme of the genital embrace."<ref name="Reich 1961 10"/>

Reich related orgastic potency and orgastic impotence to a, respectively, healthy and unhealthy sexual experience for the adult.<ref name="harvnb|Boadella|1985">{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 17-8.</ref> He described that the healthy experience has specific biological and psychological characteristics; is identical for men and women;<ref>Reich's model takes a unisex, "integrated biopsychological perspective." Source: Mah, Kenneth and Yitzchak M. Binik (2001) "The nature of human orgasm: a critical review of major trends," ''Clinical Psychology Review'' '''21'''(6): 823-56.</ref> is characterised by love and the ability to express it; full, deep, pleasurable breathing is present; deep, delicious current-like sensations run up and down the body shortly before orgasm; and involuntary muscular movements are present before climax.<ref name="Daniels 2008 Orgiastic"/> Moreover, Reich defined the healthy sexual experience exclusively in terms of the sexual union between male and female. The difference between the presence and absence of orgastic potency in the sexual encounter, as described by Reich, is summarised by Boadella as follows:<ref name="harvnb|Boadella|1985"/>

== Orgasm theory ==
Reich was strongly influenced by [[Sigmund Freud]]'s distinction between psychoneuroses and actual neuroses, the latter being considered of a physiological origin,<ref>{{harvnb|Rycroft|1971}}: 29.</ref> and the related [[libido]] as the energy of an unconscious sexual instinct.<ref>{{harvnb|Rycroft|1971}}: 18-22.</ref>  However, Reich emphasised the libido theory exactly when it was being discarded by psychoanalysis.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 19.</ref> 

Freud observed that one group of patients suffering from neurosis had sexual disturbances&mdash;practising [[coitus interruptus]], conflicts related to [[masturbation]] or [[sexual abstinence]]&mdash;and were cured when these disturbances were removed. Hence, Freud reasoned that sexual maladaption caused the active damming-up of "sexual stuff"<ref name="Raknes 1944"/> and defined "actual neurosis" as [[anxiety]] based on dammed-up [[libido]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kovel|1991}}.</ref> In contrast, those with [[Psychoneurosis|psychoneuroses]] had conflicts related to the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]: repressed impulses, desires and memories, and repressed unresolved conflicts and childhood [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]s.<ref name="Raknes 1944"/> Freud abandoned this view in the 1920s and postulated the never popularly accepted [[death instinct]] to explain the destructive behaviour that was earlier attributed to frustrated libido.<ref>{{harvnb|Rycroft|1971}}: 34, 36-7.</ref>

Reich distinguished between complete release of accumulated sexual tensions in orgasm, resulting in the restoration of energy equilibrium, and orgastic impotence, in which the release of energy is incomplete.<ref name="Daniels 2008 Neurotic">{{harvnb|Daniels|2008}}: "Neurotic Sexuality."</ref>  In other words, he argued that the inability of psychoneurotics to wholly discharge sexual energy caused a damming up of energy (or sexual stasis), leaving them in a vicious circle: the actual neurosis physiologically provided the energy for the psychoneurosis, while the psychoneurosis provided a psychological mechanism to maintain the actual neurosis.<ref name="Daniels 2008 Neurotic"/><ref>{{harvnb|Rycroft|1971}}: 29-31.</ref> Accordingly, Reich defined neurosis as the sum total of all chronic and automatic inhibitions of natural sexual excitations<ref name="Daniels 2008 Neurotic"/> and which results in an outer rigidity and inner anxiety fuelling harshness, brutality, sexual sadism, restriction, mechanisation, confinement to routines and becoming filled with compulsions or phobias as well as loneliness, helplessness, craving for authority, fear of responsibility and mystical longing.<ref>{{harvnb|Baker|1986}}: 3, 10 (in pdf).</ref> Orgastic potency enables the individual to receive satisfaction in the sex act, whereas those lacking in it are forever seeking it, and are therefore likely to be more sexually needy.<ref>{{harvnb|Baker|1986}}: 12 (in pdf).</ref>

Reich's view of the relationship between actual and psychoneuroses has not found its way into psychoanalytic thinking. However, it has the advantage of connecting psychopathology with physiology and, according to Rycroft, this makes Reich the only psychoanalyst to provide any explanation as to why childhood pathogenic experiences (causing neuroses in classical psychoanalysis) do not disappear when neurotics leave their childhood environment.<ref>{{harvnb|Rycroft|1971}}: 31.</ref>

==Recurrence in Reich's work==
Reich expanded on the concept throughout his career. In his 1942 scientific autobiography ''The Discovery of Orgone, Vol. 1: The Function of the Orgasm'', Reich provided the following summary of his findings regarding orgastic potency: it is an outcome of [[health]], he argued, because full orgastic potency can only come about if a person is psychologically free of neurosis (pleasure [[anxiety]] absent), physically free from "body armor" (chronic [[Muscle contraction|muscular contraction]] absent), socially free from [[Compulsive behavior|compulsive]] morality and duty as imposed by [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and mechanistic ways of life, and has the natural ability to love.<ref>{{harvnb|Reich|1999}}: 6-8.</ref> According to one source, Reich held that the vast majority of people do not meet these criteria and thus lack orgastic potency.<ref>{{harvnb|Konia|1987}}.</ref>

Reich retained the idea of a sexual energy and the concept orgastic potency as central elements in [[sex-economy]], a general Reichian theory of health dealing with an organism's energy household.<ref>{{harvnb|Raknes|1944}}: "Lead."</ref> Reich progressively called this energy libido, sexual energy, emotional energy, bioelectric energy, biophysical energy and, finally, [[orgone]] ("life") energy. In terms of this theory, an individual lacking in orgastic potency is unable to fully discharge energy in orgasm, and thus remains in a constant state of tension, both physical rigidity and mental anxiety, which constitutes neurosis.<ref>{{harvnb|Baker|1986}}: 2, 10 (in pdf).</ref>

=== Character and muscular armor ===
In Reichian psychology, the individual lacking orgastic potency is seen to have developed a neurotic [[psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] "armor" that blocks the experience of pleasure. This is differentiated between the functionally identical "character armor" and "muscular armor."<ref name="Reich 1961 10">{{harvnb|Reich|1961}}: 10.</ref>

Central to Reichian character analysis is the concept of "character resistance" or "character defence", by which a person's character&mdash;what the patient did rather than what he or she said&mdash;was seen as his or her primary defence mechanism. Character attributes include posture, expression, and way of speaking.<ref>{{harvnb|Daniels|2008}}.</ref> Reich defined character armor as "[t]he sum total of typical character attitudes which an individual develops as a blocking against his emotional excitations, resulting in rigidity of the body, lack of emotional contact, and 'deadness'."<ref name="Reich 1961 10"/>

===Genital and neurotic character===
Reich used the terms "genital character" and "neurotic character" respectively to distinguish between characters with and without orgastic potency. Real characters of actual people are considered to be somewhere on a continuum between the two. The genital character is the non-neurotic character structure, which is free from armor and, therefore, has the capacity of natural-self regulation on the basis of orgastic potency.<ref name="Reich 1961 9-12">{{harvnb|Reich|1961}}: 9-12.</ref> The genital character is able to fully focus on a task or object, has a natural yearning for continued human contact that finds expression in work and social life, feels a healthy sympathy for fellow human beings in sorrow and happiness, and experiences life as a fulfilment and unfolding of his or her natural tendencies and struggle to achieve objectives. His or her sex life attains full bloom in a context of heterosexual intercourse with full surrender, without identifying the partner either consciously or unconsciously with a parent, without wishing to torment or to be tormented, without accepting celibacy except for strongly convincing reasons, and without looking for another partner so long as his or her affection for the partner is reciprocated.<ref name="Raknes 1944"/>

The neurotic character operates under a principle of compulsive moral regulation due to chronic energy stasis.<ref name="Reich 1961 9-12"/> The neurotic character's work and life is permeated by struggle to suppress original and even more basic urges or tendencies. The various forms of neurotic character correspond to the equally many ways of suppressing such urges or tendencies that the human being in question considers to be dangerous or is ashamed of. A feeling of inferiority may sometimes lead to a striving for power and honor; work is directed by such desires or by duty, rather than by a striving for joy and happiness. His or her sex life is disturbed by impulses derived from pregenital wishes, so strong that they prevent the experience of full release during orgasm, or else genital wishes are so suppressed by prohibitions and a guilty conscience that they either inhibit a full release during orgasm or prevent the establishment of an adult sex life.<ref name="Raknes 1944"/> Sexual discharge will leave him or her empty, unsatisfied, and not fully at peace,<ref name="Daniels 2008 Neurotic"/> resulting in sensations of emptiness and a feeling of inferiority, a widespread phenomenon termed [[post-coital tristesse]].<ref name="Raknes 1944"/>

Reich argued that if repression occurred, this energy, in the form of stored emotions or [[affect (psychology)|affect]]s, was held back by [[Muscle contraction|muscular contraction]] or armor, which restricts and immobilises the body and becomes the [[somatic]] core of neuroses, making full orgastic discharge impossible.<ref>{{harvnb|Baker|1986}}: 2 (in pdf).</ref> Reich defined muscular armor as: "The sum total of the muscular attitudes (chronic muscular spasms) which an individual develops as a block against the breakthrough of emotions and organ sensations, in particular anxiety, rage, and sexual excitation."<ref name="Reich 1961 9-12"/> Muscular armor prevents the sexual climax from being experienced throughout the body.<ref name="Daniels 2008 Orgiastic">{{harvnb|Daniels|2008}}: "Orgiastic Potency" {{sic}}.</ref> For example, forms of armoring are pulling back the [[pelvis]] or tightening the [[thigh]] and [[buttock]] muscles.<ref>{{harvnb|Daniels|2008}}: "Sexuality and Armoring."</ref> Reich regarded the ego as playing an active part in the act of perception, since whereas some people perceive the gentle stroking of an [[erogenous zone]] as pleasurable, for others it is merely a tactile sensation.<ref>{{harvnb|Reich|1999}}: 52.</ref>

==== Resolving armor ====
{{Main|Vegetotherapy}} {{Further|Body psychotherapy|Neo-Reichian massage|Bioenergetic analysis|Gestalt therapy|Primal therapy}}
Dissolving character and muscular rigidifications or armorings is the basic principle of Reichian [[vegetotherapy]].<ref>{{harvnb|Reich|1999}}: 8.</ref> This dissolution softens movement, eases breathing, and can also bring back the repressed memory of the childhood situation that caused the repression, Reich wrote.<ref name="Sharaf 1994 238-41, 243">{{harvnb|Sharaf|1994}}: 238-41, 243.</ref> The two goals of vegetotherapy are the attainment of orgastic potency during sexual intercourse and of the "orgasm reflex" during therapy. The orgasm reflex may be observed as waves of pleasure moving through the body, a series of spontaneous, involuntary movements,<ref name="Sharaf 1994 238-41, 243"/> and signifies that the person is free of body armoring, entailing the ability to give and receive love in all its forms.<ref name="Daniels 2008 Neurotic"/>

=== Implications for society ===

==== Prevention through social reform ====
''The Invasion of Compulsory Sex-Morality'', written in 1931, was Reich's first step in approaching the answer to the problem of mass neuroses in society, followed by ''[[The Mass Psychology of Fascism]]'' and ''[[Die Sexualit<U+00E4>t im Kulturkampf|The Sexual Revolution]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilhelm Reich Infant Trust|2011}}.</ref> The primary sociological issues with which Reich dealt included in particular the following three:
# How to prevent neurosis through correct upbringing and education.
# How to prevent sex-negative attitudes in society through sexual reform.
# How to prevent authoritarian repression through general social reform.<ref>{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 62.</ref>

==== Negative social effects ====
Reich coined the term "emotional plague" to refer to a special group dynamic when the destructive, pathological impulses of a group of neurotic characters become mutually reinforcing.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 215.</ref>
<U+201C>Emotional<U+201D> refers to the element of social irrationalism in people. <U+201C>Plague<U+201D> refers to the contagious, infectious nature and the difficulty of resisting it. Thus, whereas the neurotic character struggles with feelings of guilt in order to suppress destructive drives (e.g. a torture fantasy), people with the emotional plague unconsciously provide each other with a social alibi to act out these suppressed drives. That is, they adopt a group ideology that rationalises acting on irrational, secondary drives. An example would be the [[Salem witch trials]] in which dissident Christians were tortured and executed by their own group.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

===Bio-electric experiments===
In 1934, Reich expanded his orgasm theory in the essay "Der Orgasmus als Elektro-physiologische Entladung" ("The Orgasm as an Electrophysiological Discharge").<ref name="ReferenceC">{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 103-4.</ref> Through clinical observations in his sex-counseling centers, Reich concluded that conceiving of the orgasm as only mechanical tension and relaxation could not explain why some experience gratification and others do not.<ref>{{harvnb|Reich|1982}}: 8-9.</ref> Thus, based on the work of [[Friedrich Kraus]] and others, Reich proposed that the orgasm is a bio-electric discharge, and is part of what Reich termed the orgasm formula:
<blockquote>
mechanical tension > bioelectric charge > bioelectric discharge > mechanical relaxation.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>
</blockquote>

Secondly, in 1934 Reich published the paper "Der Urgegensatz des Vegetatives Lebens" ("Sexuality and Anxiety: The Basic Antithesis of Vegetative Life"). The paper is a literature study in which Reich explored "the physiology of the ''autonomic nervous system'', the ''chemistry'' of anxiety, the ''electro-physiology'' of the body fluids and the ''hydro-mechanics'' of plasma movements in protozoa."<ref>{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 103-4, italics in original.</ref> In conclusion, Reich proposed a functional psychosomatic antithesis between the [[Parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] and [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] nervous systems, captured respectively as pleasure or movement "towards the world", and anxiety or movement "away from the world".<ref>{{harvnb|Reich|1982}}: 68-9.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 109.</ref> The corollary is the idea that bioelectric energy displayed an antithetic function: if it flows outward to the skin surface, causing a build-up of charge at the skin, it is experienced as [[pleasure]]; in contrast, if it flows inward, away from the skin surface, resulting in a lowering of charge at the skin, then it is experienced as an increase in central tension or [[anxiety]].<ref>{{harvnb|Baker|1986}}: 6-7 (in pdf).</ref> 

Thirdly, in 1937 Reich published ''Experimentelle Ergebnisse <U+00FC>ber die elektrische Funktion von Sexualitat und Angst'' (''The Bioelectrical Function of Sexuality and Anxiety'') in which he thought he experimentally verified the existence of what he first termed the "libidinal economy."<ref>{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 131, 135.</ref> The report summarised two years of research into the reaction of the skin to states of pleasure and anxiety. His findings included the following: normal skin has a constant, basic electrical charge of 40 milivolts that does not change with mood states; erogenous zones have a wandering potential that can at times be much higher (200 milivolts) or lower, depending on the mood states; change in potential does not depend on the mechanical nature of the stimulus, but on changes in the subject's sensation or emotion; and, erogenous zones can have mechanical tension (be tumescent) without changes in levels of the charge, e.g. as in the case of a 'cold erection'.<ref>{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 131-4.</ref>

===Orgone energy===
A common misconception about Reich's later developed [[orgone energy accumulator]] is that he claimed it could provide orgastic potency to those sitting inside the device. Reich maintained the opposite: "The orgone accumulator, as has been clearly stated in the relevant publications (''The Cancer Biopathy'', etc.), cannot provide orgastic potency."<ref>Reich, W. (1950, April) ''Orgone Energy Bulletin'' '''2'''(2), quoted in [http://www.wilhelmreichtrust.org/update_11_11.html November 2011 Update From The Wilhelm Reich Infant Trust and The Wilhelm Reich Museum], Wilhelm Reich Infant Trust (accessed 26 January 2013).</ref> Likewise, in ''The Orgone Energy Accumulator, its Scientific and Medical Use'', Reich wrote: <U+201D>Neuroses cannot be cured with physical [[orgone]] energy."<ref>quoted in Gardner, Martin (1957) ''Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science'', Courier Dover Publications: 256.</ref>

==Reception==

===Academic and psychoanalytic reception===
According to Sharaf, Reich's view that the capacity to unite tender and sensuous feelings is important for a healthy love relationship was not a new concept. Freud had noted this as early as 1912. However, Sharaf states that the involuntary physical aspects of the full genital discharge in Reich's work were new.<ref name="Sharaf 1994 86-105"/> He called the concept orgastic potency and the manner in which Reich "connected a series of psychological, social, and biological findings with the presence or absence of this function" unique to Reich.<ref>{{harvnb|Sharaf|1994}}: 4.</ref>

<!--needs academic/psychoanalytic sources-->When Reich's first introduced the orgasm theory at the psychoanalytic congress in Salzburg he was congratulated by [[Karl Abraham]] for successfully formulating the economic element of neurosis.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> However, Reich's presentation of the orgasm theory came exactly when psychoanalysis was moving away from the original Freudian instinct theory based on psychic energy. In his 1926 book ''Inhibitions, Symptoms, Anxiety'' Freud completely abandoned his earlier position and wrote: "Anxiety never arises from repressed libido."<ref>{{harvnb|Freud|1948}}: 54, quoted in {{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 20.</ref>

Freud was ambivalent in his reception. When Reich presented him the manuscript of ''Die Funktion des Orgasmus'' in May 1926, Freud replied, "That thick?" Later that year he wrote to Reich that the book was "valuable, rich in observation and thought,"<ref>{{harvnb|Freud|1942}}, quoted in {{harvnb|Sharaf|1994}}: 100<U+2013>101.</ref> but in May 1928 wrote to [[Lou Andreas-Salom<U+00E9>]]: "We have here a Dr. Reich, a worthy but impetuous young man, passionately devoted to his hobby-horse, who now salutes in the genital orgasm the antidote to every neurosis. Perhaps he might learn from your analysis of K. to feel some respect for the complicated nature of the psyche."<ref name=Freudletter/>

[[Myron Sharaf]] writes that the theory was immediately unpopular within psychoanalysis.<ref>{{harvnb|Sharaf|1994}}: 86.</ref> [[Paul Federn]] (1871<U+2013>1950), Reich's training assistant, and [[Hermann Nunberg]] (1884<U+2013>1970) were particularly opposed to it. {{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The German psychiatrist [[Arthur Kronfeld]] (1886<U+2013>1941) wrote a positive review of ''Die Funktion des Orgasmus'' in 1927: "In this extremely valuable and instructive work the author has really succeeded in broadening as well as deepening Freud's theory of sex and of the neuroses. He broadens it by clarifying for the first time the significance of the genital orgasm for the development and the whole structure of the neuroses; he deepens it by giving Freud's theory of the actual neuroses an exact psychological and physiological meaning. I do not hesitate to consider this work of Reich's the most valuable contribution since Freud's ''[[The Ego and the Id]]''."<ref>{{harvnb|Kronfeld|1927}}, quoted in {{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 19.</ref> The most prominent Freudian to make clinical use of the concept orgastic potency was Edward Hitschmann, the Director of the Psychoanalytic Polyclinic.<ref>{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 21.</ref> {{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

<!--needs academic/psychoanalytic sources-->Two further reactions to Reich's work in the psychoanalytic movement were either completely ignoring it or using the concept as if it was commonly accepted, but without referring to Reich as the source. As a result, the theme orgastic potency survived but became divorced from the concepts in which Reich embedded it. For example, in ''Clinical Psychology'' Charles Berg uses Reich's sex economic theory of anxiety as his own without attributing it to Reich.<ref>{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 23-4.</ref> [[Erik Erikson]] was another psychoanalytic writer who partially adopted Reich's concept without acknowledgement. In his bestselling ''[[Childhood and Society]]'', Erikson wrote: "Genitality, then, consists in the unobstructed capacity to develop an orgastic potency so free of pregenital interferences that the genital libido . . . is expressed in heterosexual mutuality . . . and with a convulsion-like discharge of tension from the whole body."<ref>Erikson quoted in {{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 25.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 23-5.</ref> {{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

<!--needs academic/psychoanalytic sources-->[[Otto Fenichel]], in the classic textbook ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neuroses'', uses aspects of Reich's orgasm theory but disguised that they were Reich's contribution, and furthermore he hid the conflicts in the psychoanalytic movement that were explicit in Reich's work. A major entry mainly based on Fenichel's work appeared in the 1953, 1970 ''Psychiatric Dictionary'' by L. Hinsie and R. Campbell: "''Impotence'', orgastic: The incapacity for achieving the orgasm or acme of satisfaction in the sexual act. Many neurotics cannot achieve adequate discharge of their sexual energy through the sexual act. . . . According to Fenichel, an important concomitant of orgastic impotence is that these patients are incapable of love."<ref>Hinsie and Campbell quoted in {{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 24-5.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 24-5.</ref> {{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

As of September 2012, there are no peer-reviewed articles in the [[PubMed]] database that discuss the concept orgastic potency or Reich's orgasm theory.<ref>PubMed (2012) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=reich%20AND%20orgas* "Orgastic Potency"]</ref> <!--needs a secondary source: Reich's experimental investigating regarding the biological grounding of the orgasm theory, published as ''The Bioelectrical Investigations of Sexuality and Anxiety'', were reproduced in 2010 at the University of Vienna. The study affirmed the validity of Reich's "sex-economic model of excitation-regulation" by affirming the "interconnection between the ''subjective experience'' of erogenous stimuli and skin potential deflections."<ref>Hebenstreit, G<U+00FC>nter A.

===Reichian legacy===
The two colleagues of Reich who build most on Reich's orgasm theory and orgastic potency are Philipson and Lowen. They emphasised the importance of human relationship in orgastic functions.<ref>{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 30-1.</ref>

Tage Philipson, in his 1952 book ''Kaerlighedslivet: Natur Eller Unnatur'', studied natural and unnatural love-life. He wrote that "in healthy people sexuality and love will always be associated together. Sex will come from the heart and return to the heart. . . . the fully healthy person must be the person with completely free love feelings. . . . When this is the case other feelings will also be able to stream through the entire organism: hate, sorrow, anxiety, etc., and the orgasm, as the highest point of sexuality, will also be able to affect the entire organism."<ref>{{harvnb|Philipson|1952}}, quoted in {{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 31.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 31.</ref>

[[Alexander Lowen]] in his 1966 book ''Love and Orgasm'' distinguishes between achieving orgasm in the Kinsey meaning of sexual performance, and the entering into a love relationship as a whole human, similar to Reich. Like Reich, Lowen considers the latter to be the expression of health, not a means to it.<ref>{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 31.</ref>

Theodore Wolfe, an American pioneer in psychosomatic medicine and later colleague of Reich, thought that anxiety was the cause of both neuroses and psychosomatic distortions. When reading Reich's ''Der Funktion des Orgasmus'' he found in it what he called the key to understanding the dynamics of this relationship.<ref>{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 32.</ref>

In a review of Reich's sexual theories Elsworth Baker, a psychiatrist and colleague of Reich, wrote that in particular Reich's sexual theories were commonly misinterpreted and misunderstood. While Reich was portrayed as advocating "a wild frantic promiscuity" to seek "mystical, ecstatic orgasm" that could cure all neuroses and physical ills, Baker continues, Reich in fact found that the healthy person needs less sexual activity and that the orgasm has a function to maintain health only for the healthy person.<ref>{{harvnb|Baker|1986}}: 1, 12 (in pdf).</ref>

==Comparing definitions of orgasm==
The concepts of the sexual acme used in the famous 1948 and 1953 [[Kinsey report]]s and the 1966 research by [[Masters and Johnson]] were different from the one used by Reich. Reich directly related orgastic potency with the total response system, the personality, contact-ability, total psychosomatic health of a person.<ref>{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 30.</ref> In contrast, Kinsey and Masters and Johnson restricted their conclusions to phenomena that all sexual climaxes had in common.<ref>{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 28.</ref> For example, Kinsey defined the male orgasm as "all cases of ejaculation"<ref>{{harvnb|Kinsey|1948}}: 59-60, quoted in {{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 26.</ref> and the female orgasm as "the sudden and abrupt release . . . from sexual tension, [excluding] the satisfaction that may result from sexual experience."<ref>{{harvnb|Kinsey|1953}}:628, quoted in {{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 26-7.</ref> In other words, Kinsey focusses on the physiology, anatomy and technique involved in inducing a discharge of tension. Therefore, Kinsey's usage of the term orgasm covers behaviour that in the Reichian typology ranges from orgastic potency to orgastic impotence.<ref>{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 26-7.</ref> Furthermore, examples of physiological distinctions Reich made but which were not pursued by Kinsey and Masters and Johnson include the difference between local and total bodily responses, and between voluntary and involuntary movements.<ref>{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 28-9.</ref>

;Mature orgasm
{{See also|Orgasm#Clitoral and vaginal categories}}
In 1905, Freud developed the psychoanalytic distinction between clitoral and vaginal orgasm, with only the latter being identified with [[Psychosexual development|psychosexual maturity]].<ref>{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 27.</ref> This distinction has since been challenged among others on physiological grounds. For example, Masters and Johnson wrote: "Are clitoral and vaginal orgasms truly separate and anatomic entities? From a biological point of view the answer to this question is an unequivocal NO."<ref>{{harvnb|Masters|1963}}, quoted in {{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 28.</ref> However, a clinically  grounded qualitative distinction between psychosexual maturity and immaturity was only introduced with Reich's concept orgastic potency vs. orgastic impotence (instead of vaginal vs. clitoral).<ref>{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 28.</ref> As Masters and Johnson focussed on phenomena shared by all sexual climaxes - ranging from what Reich categorised as orgastic potency to impotence - their finding has no direct relevance to or implications for Reich's distinction.<ref>{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 28.</ref>
