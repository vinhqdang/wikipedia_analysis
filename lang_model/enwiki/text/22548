The term ''atheism'' originated from the Greek {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:<U+1F04><U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03BF><U+03C2>|<U+1F04><U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03BF><U+03C2>]]}} (''atheos''), meaning "without god(s)", used as a pejorative term applied to those thought to reject the [[gods]] worshipped by the larger society. With the spread of [[freethought]], [[skeptical inquiry]], and subsequent increase in [[criticism of religion]], application of the term narrowed in scope. The first individuals to identify themselves using the word "atheist" lived in the 18th century.{{sfn|Armstrong|1999}}

Arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches.

==Definitions and distinctions==
[[File:AtheismImplicitExplicit3.svg|thumb|A diagram showing the relationship between the definitions of [[Weak and strong atheism|weak/strong]] and [[Implicit and explicit atheism|implicit/explicit]] atheism.
<br/>
Explicit strong/positive/hard atheists (in {{Font color|purple|'''purple'''}} on the '''right''') assert that ''"at least one deity exists"'' is a false statement.
<br/>
Explicit weak/negative/soft atheists (in {{Font color|blue|'''blue'''}} on the '''right''') reject or eschew belief that any deities exist without actually asserting that ''"at least one deity exists"'' is a false statement.
<br/>
Implicit weak/negative atheists (in {{Font color|blue|'''blue'''}} on the '''left''') would include people (such as young children and some agnostics) who do not believe in a deity, but have not explicitly rejected such belief.
<br/>
(Sizes in the diagram are not meant to indicate relative sizes within a population.)]]

Writers disagree how best to define and classify ''atheism'',<ref name=eb1911-atheism/> contesting what supernatural entities it applies to, whether it is an assertion in its own right or merely the absence of one, and whether it requires a conscious, explicit rejection. Atheism has been regarded as compatible with [[agnosticism]],<ref name=agnosticism-compatible/><ref name=flint-agnostic-atheism/><ref name=encyc-unbelief-compatible/><ref name=martin-agnosticism-entails/><ref name=barker-agnostic-atheism/><ref name=besant-open-to-new-truth/><ref name=holyoake-question-of-probability/> and has also been contrasted with it.<ref name=eb2011-atheism-critique/><ref name=eb2011concise-atheism/><ref name=eb1911-atheism-sceptical/> A variety of categories have been used to distinguish the different forms of atheism.

===Range===
Some of the ambiguity and controversy involved in defining ''atheism'' arises from difficulty in reaching a consensus for the definitions of words like ''deity'' and ''god''. The plurality of wildly different [[Conceptions of God|conceptions of god]] and deities leads to differing ideas regarding atheism's applicability. The ancient Romans accused Christians of being atheists for not worshiping the [[paganism|pagan]] deities. Gradually, this view fell into disfavor as ''theism'' came to be understood as encompassing belief in any divinity.{{sfn|Martin|2006}}

With respect to the range of phenomena being rejected, atheism may counter anything from the existence of a deity, to the existence of any [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[supernatural]], or [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] concepts, such as those of [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Taoism]].<ref name=eb2011-Rejection-of-all-religious-beliefs/>

===Implicit vs. explicit===
{{Main|Implicit and explicit atheism}}
Definitions of atheism also vary in the degree of consideration a person must put to the idea of gods to be considered an atheist. Atheism has sometimes been defined to include the simple absence of belief that any deities exist. This broad definition would include newborns and other people who have not been exposed to theistic ideas. As far back as 1772, [[Baron d'Holbach]] said that "All children are born Atheists; they have no idea of God."<ref>{{cite book |last=d'Holbach |first=P. H. T. |authorlink=Baron d'Holbach |title=Good Sense |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7319 |year=1772 |accessdate=2011-04-07}}
</ref>
Similarly, [[George H. Smith]] (1979) suggested that: "The man who is unacquainted with theism is an atheist because he does not believe in a god. This category would also include the child with the conceptual capacity to grasp the issues involved, but who is still unaware of those issues. The fact that this child does not believe in god qualifies him as an atheist."<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=14}}.
</ref>
Smith coined the term ''implicit atheism'' to refer to "the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it" and ''explicit atheism'' to refer to the more common definition of conscious disbelief.
[[Ernest Nagel]] contradicts Smith's definition of atheism as merely "absence of theism", acknowledging only explicit atheism as true "atheism".<ref name= Nagel1959>

===Positive vs. negative===
{{Main|Negative and positive atheism}}
Philosophers such as [[Antony Flew]]<ref name="presumption">{{harvnb|Flew|1976|pp=14ff}}: "In this interpretation an atheist becomes: not someone who positively asserts the non-existence of God; but someone who is simply not a theist. Let us, for future ready reference, introduce the labels 'positive atheist' for the former and 'negative atheist' for the latter."
</ref>
and [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]]{{sfn|Martin|2006}} have contrasted positive (strong/hard) atheism with negative (weak/soft) atheism. Positive atheism is the explicit affirmation that gods do not exist. Negative atheism includes all other forms of non-theism. According to this categorization, anyone who is not a theist is either a negative or a positive atheist.
The terms ''weak'' and ''strong'' are relatively recent, while the terms ''negative'' and ''positive'' atheism are of older origin, having been used (in slightly different ways) in the philosophical literature<ref name="presumption"/> and in Catholic apologetics.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/jm3303.htm |title=On the Meaning of Contemporary Atheism |journal=The Review of Politics |first=Jacques |last=Maritain |year=1949 |month=July |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=267<U+2013>280 |doi=10.1017/S0034670500044168 |ref=harv}}

Under this demarcation of atheism, most agnostics qualify as negative atheists.

While [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Martin]], for example, asserts that agnosticism [[logical consequence|entails]] negative atheism,<ref name=martin-agnosticism-entails/> many agnostics see their view as distinct from atheism,<ref name=Kenny2006 /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/omar-baddar/why-im-not-an-atheist-the-case-for-agnosticism_b_3345544.html | title=Why I'm Not an Atheist: The Case for Agnosticism |date=28 May 2013 |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=2013-11-26}}

</ref>
The assertion of unattainability of knowledge for or against the existence of gods is sometimes seen as indication that atheism requires a [[leap of faith]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Many atheists I know would be certain of a high place in heaven |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0725/1224251303564.html|last=O'Brien|first=Breda |authorlink=Breda O'Brien|publisher=Irish Times| accessdate=2011-04-09 |date=7 July 2009

</ref> 
Common atheist responses to this argument include that unproven ''[[faith#Faith in world religions|religious]]'' propositions deserve as much disbelief as all ''other'' unproven propositions,<ref>{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|pp=30<U+2013>34}}. "Who seriously claims we should say 'I neither believe nor disbelieve that the Pope is a robot', or 'As to whether or not eating this piece of chocolate will turn me into an elephant I am completely agnostic'. In the absence of any good reasons to believe these outlandish claims, we rightly disbelieve them, we don't just suspend judgement."
</ref>
and that the unprovability of a god's existence does not imply equal probability of either possibility.<ref>{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=22}}. "A lack of proof is no grounds for the suspension of belief. This is because when we have a lack of absolute proof we can still have overwhelming evidence or one explanation which is far superior to the alternatives."
</ref>
Scottish philosopher [[J. J. C. Smart]] even argues that "sometimes a person who is really an atheist may describe herself, even passionately, as an agnostic because of unreasonable generalised [[philosophical skepticism]] which would preclude us from saying that we know anything whatever, except perhaps the truths of mathematics and formal logic."<ref name="stanford">{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/ |title=Atheism and Agnosticism |first=J.C.C. |last=Smart |date=9 March 2004 |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | accessdate=2011-04-09}}
</ref>
Consequently, some atheist authors such as [[Richard Dawkins]] prefer distinguishing theist, agnostic and atheist positions along a [[spectrum of theistic probability]]<U+2014>the likelihood that each assigns to the statement "God exists".{{sfn|Dawkins|2006|p=50}}

===Definition as impossible or impermanent===
Before the 18th century, the existence of God was so universally accepted in the western world that even the possibility of true atheism was questioned. This is called ''theistic [[innatism]]''<U+2014>the notion that all people believe in God from birth; within this view was the connotation that atheists are simply in denial.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cudworth |first=Ralph |authorlink=Ralph Cudworth |title=The True Intellectual System of the Universe: the first part, wherein all the reason and philosophy of atheism is confuted and its impossibility demonstrated |year=1678}}
</ref>

There is also a position claiming that atheists are quick to believe in God in times of crisis, that atheists make [[deathbed conversion]]s, or that "there are no [[atheists in foxholes]]".<ref>See, for instance, {{cite web|url=http://www.lds-mormon.com/atheist.shtml|title=Atheists call for church head to retract slur|date=3 September 1996| accessdate=2011-04-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110515175331/http://www.lds-mormon.com/atheist.shtml| archivedate=2011-05-15 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}

There have however been examples to the contrary, among them examples of literal "atheists in foxholes".<ref>{{cite web |last=Lowder |first=Jeffery Jay |year=1997 |title=Atheism and Society |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/jeff_lowder/society.html | accessdate=2011-04-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110522025011/http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/jeff_lowder/society.html| archivedate=2011-05-22 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}

Some atheists have doubted the very need for the term "atheism". In his book ''[[Letter to a Christian Nation]]'', [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] wrote:
<blockquote>In fact, "atheism" is a term that should not even exist. No one ever needs to identify himself as a "non-[[Astrology|astrologer]]" or a "non-[[Alchemy|alchemist]]". We do not have words for people who doubt that Elvis is still alive or that aliens have traversed the galaxy only to molest ranchers and their cattle. Atheism is nothing more than the noises reasonable people make in the presence of unjustified religious beliefs.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=[http://books.google.com/?id=ypyMZlkgHGIC&pg=PA51&dq=No+one+ever+needs+to+identify+himself+as+a+%22non-astrologer%22+or+a+%22non-alchemist&f=false 51]}}</blockquote>

]]

The broadest demarcation of atheistic rationale is between practical and theoretical atheism.

===Practical atheism===
{{Main|Apatheism}}
In ''practical'' or ''[[pragmatism|pragmatic]]'' atheism, also known as ''[[apatheism]]'', individuals live as if there are no gods and explain natural phenomena without reference to any deities. The existence of gods is not rejected, but may be designated unnecessary or useless; gods neither provide purpose to life, nor influence everyday life, according to this view.<ref name="Zdybicka-p20">{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=20}}.
</ref>

</ref>

Practical atheism can take various forms:
* Absence of religious motivation<U+2014>belief in gods does not motivate moral action, religious action, or any other form of action;
* Active exclusion of the problem of gods and religion from intellectual pursuit and practical action;
* Indifference<U+2014>the absence of any interest in the problems of gods and religion; or
* Unawareness of the concept of a deity.<ref>{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=21}}.
</ref>

===Theoretical atheism===

====Ontological arguments====
{{Further|Agnostic atheism|Theological noncognitivism}}
Theoretical (or theoric) atheism explicitly posits arguments against the existence of gods, responding to common [[Arguments for the existence of God|theistic arguments]] such as the [[argument from design]] or [[Pascal's Wager]]. Theoretical atheism is mainly an ontology, precisely a [[physical ontology]].

====Epistemological arguments====
{{Further|Agnostic atheism|Theological noncognitivism}}
[[Epistemology|Epistemological]] atheism argues that people cannot know a God or determine the existence of a God. The foundation of epistemological atheism is agnosticism, which takes a variety of forms. In the philosophy of [[immanence]], divinity is inseparable from the world itself, including a person's mind, and each person's [[consciousness]] is locked in the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]. According to this form of agnosticism, this limitation in perspective prevents any objective inference from belief in a god to assertions of its existence. The [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] agnosticism of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] only accepts knowledge deduced with human rationality; this form of atheism holds that gods are not discernible as a matter of principle, and therefore cannot be known to exist. [[Skepticism]], based on the ideas of [[David Hume|Hume]], asserts that certainty about anything is impossible, so one can never know for sure whether or not a god exists. Hume, however, held that such unobservable metaphysical concepts should be rejected as "sophistry and illusion".<ref name=hume-metaphysics/> The allocation of agnosticism to atheism is disputed; it can also be regarded as an independent, basic worldview.<ref name="Zdybicka-p20"/>

Other arguments for atheism that can be classified as epistemological or [[ontology|ontological]], including [[logical positivism]] and [[ignosticism]], assert the meaninglessness or unintelligibility of basic terms such as "God" and statements such as "God is all-powerful." [[Theological noncognitivism]] holds that the statement "God exists" does not express a proposition, but is nonsensical or cognitively meaningless. It has been argued both ways as to whether such individuals can be classified into some form of atheism or agnosticism. Philosophers [[Alfred Ayer|A. J. Ayer]] and [[Theodore M. Drange]] reject both categories, stating that both camps accept "God exists" as a proposition; they instead place noncognitivism in its own category.<ref>[[Theodore Drange|Drange, Theodore M.]] (1998). "[http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/definition.html Atheism, Agnosticism, Noncognitivism]". [[Internet Infidels]], ''Secular Web Library''. Retrieved 2007-APR-07.

</ref>

====Metaphysical arguments====
{{Further|Monism|Physicalism}}
One author writes:
{{quote|"Metaphysical atheism&nbsp;<U+2026> includes all doctrines that hold to metaphysical monism (the homogeneity of reality). Metaphysical atheism may be either: a) absolute <U+2014> an explicit denial of God's existence associated with materialistic monism (all materialistic trends, both in ancient and modern times); b) relative <U+2014> the implicit denial of God in all philosophies that, while they accept the existence of an absolute, conceive of the absolute as not possessing any of the attributes proper to God: transcendence, a personal character or unity. Relative atheism is associated with idealistic monism (pantheism, panentheism, deism)."<ref>{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=19}}.</ref>}}

[[File:Epikouros BM 1843.jpg|thumb|left|[[Epicurus]] is credited with first expounding the [[problem of evil]]. [[David Hume]] in his ''[[Dialogues concerning Natural Religion]]'' (1779) cited Epicurus in stating the argument as a series of questions:{{sfn|Hume|1779}}
"Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is impotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?"]]

====Logical arguments====

Logical atheism holds that the various [[conceptions of God|conceptions of gods]], such as the [[personal god]] of Christianity, are ascribed logically inconsistent qualities. Such atheists present [[existence of God#Deductive arguments|deductive arguments]] against the existence of God, which assert the incompatibility between certain traits, such as perfection, creator-status, [[immutability (theology)|immutability]], [[omniscience]], [[omnipresence]], [[omnipotence]], [[omnibenevolence]], [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]], personhood (a personal being), nonphysicality, [[justice]], and [[mercy]].<ref name=logical>{{cite web | url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/nontheism/atheism/logical.html | author=Various authors | title=Logical Arguments for Atheism | publisher=[[Internet Infidels]] | work=The Secular Web Library | accessdate=2012-10-02}}</ref>

[[Theodicy|Theodicean]] atheists believe that the world as they experience it cannot be reconciled with the qualities commonly ascribed to God and gods by theologians. They argue that an [[omniscience|omniscient]], [[omnipotence|omnipotent]], and [[omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] God is not compatible with a world where there is [[problem of evil|evil]] and [[suffering]], and where divine love is [[Divine hiddenness|hidden]] from many people.<ref name=Drange-1996>{{cite web | first=Theodore M. | last=Drange | authorlink=Theodore Drange | year=1996 | url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/aeanb.html | title=The Arguments From Evil and Nonbelief | publisher=[[Internet Infidels]] |work=Secular Web Library | accessdate=2012-10-02}}

===Reductionary accounts of religion===
{{Further|Evolutionary origin of religions|Evolutionary psychology of religion|Psychology of religion}}
Philosopher [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]]<ref>Feuerbach, Ludwig (1841) ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]''</ref>
and psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] have argued that God and other religious beliefs are human inventions, created to fulfill various psychological and emotional wants or needs. This is also a view of many [[Buddhism|Buddhists]].<ref>Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught.'' Grove Press, 1974. Pages 51<U+2013>52.</ref>
[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], influenced by the work of Feuerbach, argued that belief in God and religion are social functions, used by those in power to oppress the working class. According to [[Mikhail Bakunin]], "the idea of God implies the abdication of human reason and justice; it is the most decisive negation of human liberty, and necessarily ends in the enslavement of mankind, in theory and practice." He reversed [[Voltaire]]'s famous aphorism that if God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him, writing instead that "if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish him."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bakunin/godandstate/godandstate_ch1.html |title=God and the State |last=Bakunin |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Bakunin |year=1916 |work= |publisher=New York: Mother Earth Publishing Association | accessdate=2011-04-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110521195435/http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bakunin/godandstate/godandstate_ch1.html| archivedate=2011-05-21 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}

==Atheist philosophies==
{{Further|Atheist existentialism|Humanism}}
[[Axiological]], or constructive, atheism rejects the existence of gods in favor of a "higher absolute", such as [[Human nature|humanity]].<!-- The previous wikilink is a disambiguation page. Someone redirect it to human race, human nature, etc., etc. --> This form of atheism favors humanity as the absolute source of ethics and values, and permits individuals to resolve moral problems without resorting to God. Marx and Freud used this argument to convey messages of liberation, full-development, and unfettered happiness.<ref name="Zdybicka-p20"/> One of the most common [[criticism of atheism|criticisms of atheism]] has been to the contrary<U+2014>that denying the existence of a god leads to [[moral relativism]], leaving one with no moral or ethical foundation,<ref name="misconceptions">{{cite web |url=http://articles.exchristian.net/2006/12/common-misconceptions-about-atheists.html |title=Common Misconceptions About Atheists and Atheism |last=Gleeson |first=David |date=10 August 2006 | accessdate=2013-11-21}}</ref> or renders life [[meaning of life (religious)|meaningless]] and miserable.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=275}}. "Perhaps the most common criticism of atheism is the claim that it leads inevitably to [[moral bankruptcy]]."
</ref> [[Blaise Pascal]] argued this view in his [[Pens<U+00E9>es]].<ref>[[Blaise Pascal|Pascal, Blaise]] (1669). ''[[Pens<U+00E9>es]]'', II: "The Misery of Man Without God".
</ref>

French philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] identified himself as a representative of an "[[atheist existentialism]]"{{sfn|Sartre|2004|p=127}}
concerned less with denying the existence of God than with establishing that "man needs&nbsp;<U+2026> to find himself again and to understand that nothing can save him from himself, not even a valid proof of the existence of God."{{sfn|Sartre|2001|p=45}}
Sartre said a corollary of his atheism was that "if God does not exist, there is at least one being in whom existence precedes essence, a being who exists before he can be defined by any concept, and&nbsp;<U+2026> this being is man."{{sfn|Sartre|2004|p=127}}
The practical consequence of this atheism was described by Sartre as meaning that there are no ''a priori rules'' or absolute values that can be invoked to govern human conduct, and that humans are "condemned" to invent these for themselves, making "man" absolutely "responsible for everything he does".{{sfn|Sartre|2001|p=32}}

Sociologist Phil Zuckerman analyzed previous social science research on secularity and non-belief, and concluded that societal well-being is positively correlated with irreligion.

The strictest sense of positive atheism does not entail any specific beliefs outside of disbelief in any deity; as such, atheists can hold any number of spiritual beliefs. For the same reason, atheists can hold a wide variety of ethical beliefs, ranging from the [[moral universalism]] of [[humanism]], which holds that a moral code should be applied consistently to all humans, to [[moral nihilism]], which holds that morality is meaningless.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1979|pp=21<U+2013>22}}
</ref>

Philosophers such as [[Georges Bataille]], [[Slavoj <U+017D>i<U+017E>ek]],<ref>Slavoj <U+017D>i<U+017E>ek: Less Than Nothing (2012)</ref> [[Alain de Botton]],<ref>Alain de Botton: Religion for Atheists (2012)</ref> and [[Alexander Bard]] and [[Jan S<U+00F6>derqvist]],<ref>Alexander Bard and Jan S<U+00F6>derqvist: The Global Empire (2012)</ref> have all argued that atheists should reclaim religion as an act of defiance against theism, precisely not to leave religion as an unwarranted monopoly to theists.

===Divine command vs. ethics===
Although it is a philosophical truism, encapsulated in Plato's [[Euthyphro dilemma]], that the role of the gods in determining right from wrong is either unnecessary or arbitrary, [[Divine command theory|the argument that morality must be derived from God]] and cannot exist without a wise creator has been a persistent feature of political if not so much philosophical debate.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=275}}. "Among the many myths associated with religion, none is more widespread -{{sic}}or more disastrous in its effects<U+2014>than the myth that moral values cannot be divorced from the belief in a god."
</ref><ref>
In [[Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' (Book Eleven: ''Brother Ivan Fyodorovich'', Chapter 4) there is the famous argument that ''If there is no God, all things are permitted.'': "'But what will become of men then?' I asked him, 'without God and immortal life? All things are lawful then, they can do what they like?'"
</ref><ref name="Kant CPR A811">
For [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], the presupposition of God, soul, and freedom was a practical concern, for "Morality, by itself, constitutes a system, but happiness does not, unless it is distributed in exact proportion to morality. This, however, is possible in an intelligible world only under a wise author and ruler. Reason compels us to admit such a ruler, together with life in such a world, which we must consider as future life, or else all moral laws are to be considered as idle dreams&nbsp;<U+2026>" (''Critique of Pure Reason'', A811).
</ref>
Moral precepts such as "murder is wrong" are seen as [[divine law]]s, requiring a divine lawmaker and judge. However, many atheists argue that treating morality legalistically involves a [[false analogy]], and that morality does not depend on a lawmaker in the same way that laws do.<ref>{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=38}}

(among others) assert that behaving ethically only because of divine mandate is not true ethical behavior but merely blind obedience. Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves<U+2014>to be able to discern, for example, that "thou shalt steal" is immoral even if one's religion instructs it<U+2014>and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations.<ref>{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=43}}

The contemporary British political philosopher Martin Cohen has offered the more historically telling example of Biblical injunctions in favour of torture and slavery as evidence of how religious injunctions follow political and social customs, rather than vice versa, but also noted that the same tendency seems to be true of supposedly dispassionate and objective philosophers.<ref>101 Ethical Dilemmas, 2nd edition, by Cohen, M., Routledge 2007, pp&nbsp;184<U+2013>5. (Cohen notes particularly that Plato and Aristotle produced arguments in favour of slavery.)

In early [[ancient Greek]], the adjective ''{{Transl|grc|atheos}}'' ({{lang|grc|[[:wikt:<U+1F04><U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03BF><U+03C2>|<U+1F04><U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03BF><U+03C2>]]}}, from the [[privative a|privative <U+1F00>-]] + {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:<U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03CC><U+03C2>|<U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03CC><U+03C2>]]}} "god") meant "godless". It was first used as a term of censure roughly meaning "ungodly" or "impious". In the 5th century BCE, the word began to indicate more deliberate and active godlessness in the sense of "severing relations with the gods" or "denying the gods". The term [[:wikt:<U+1F00><U+03C3><U+03B5><U+03B2><U+03AE><U+03C2>|<U+1F00><U+03C3><U+03B5><U+03B2><U+03AE><U+03C2>]] (''{{Transl|grc|aseb<U+0113>s}}'') then came to be applied against those who impiously denied or disrespected the local gods, even if they believed in other gods. Modern translations of classical texts sometimes render ''{{Transl|grc|atheos}}'' as "atheistic". As an abstract noun, there was also {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:<U+1F00><U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03CC><U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03C2>|<U+1F00><U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03CC><U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03C2>]]}} (''{{Transl|grc|atheot<U+0113>s}}''), "atheism". [[Cicero]] transliterated the Greek word into the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|[[:wikt:atheos#Latin|atheos]]}}''. The term found frequent use in the debate between [[early Christianity|early Christians]] and [[Ancient Greek religion|Hellenists]], with each side attributing it, in the pejorative sense, to the other.<ref name=drachmann>{{cite book |last=Drachmann |first=A.

In exactly the same way as ungodly, ''{{Transl |grc |atheos}}'' was used as an expression of severe censure and moral condemnation; this use is an old one, and the oldest that can be traced.

At that time "deist" and "deism" already carried their modern meaning. The term ''theism'' came to be contrasted with deism.

[[Karen Armstrong]] writes that "During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the word 'atheist' was still reserved exclusively for [[polemic]]&nbsp;<U+2026> The term 'atheist' was an insult. Nobody would have dreamed of calling ''himself'' an atheist."{{sfn|Armstrong|1999}}

''Atheism'' was first used to describe a self-avowed belief in late 18th-century Europe, specifically denoting disbelief in the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[Abrahamic god]].<ref name="adevism">In part because of its wide use in monotheistic Western society, ''atheism'' is usually described as "disbelief in God", rather than more generally as "disbelief in deities". A clear distinction is rarely drawn in modern writings between these two definitions, but some archaic uses of ''atheism'' encompassed only disbelief in the singular God, not in [[polytheism|polytheistic]] deities. It is on this basis that the obsolete term ''[[adevism]]'' was coined in the late 19th century to describe an absence of belief in plural deities.</ref><ref name="eb1911-atheonism"/>
In the 20th century, [[globalization]] contributed to the expansion of the term to refer to disbelief in all deities, though it remains common in Western society to describe atheism as simply "disbelief in God".{{sfn|Martin|2006}}

The thoroughly materialistic and anti-theistic philosophical [[C<U+0101>rv<U+0101>ka]] (also called ''Nastika'' or ''Lokaiata'') school that originated in [[India]] around the 6th century BCE is probably the most explicitly atheistic school of philosophy in India, similar to the Greek [[Cyrenaic school]]. This branch of Indian philosophy is classified as [[nastika|heterodox]] due to its rejection of the authority of [[Vedas]] and hence is not considered part of the six orthodox schools of Hinduism, but it is noteworthy as evidence of a materialistic movement within Hinduism.<ref>Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles A. Moore. ''A Sourcebook in Indian Philosophy''. (Princeton University Press: 1957, Twelfth Princeton Paperback printing 1989) pp. 227<U+2013>249. ISBN 0-691-01958-4.

Chatterjee and Datta explain that our understanding of C<U+0101>rv<U+0101>ka philosophy is fragmentary, based largely on criticism of the ideas by other schools, and that it is not a living tradition:

<blockquote>
"Though [[materialism]] in some form or other has always been present in India, and occasional references are found in the Vedas, the Buddhistic literature, the Epics, as well as in the later philosophical works we do not find any systematic work on materialism, nor any organized school of followers as the other philosophical schools possess. But almost every work of the other schools states, for refutation, the materialistic views. Our knowledge of Indian materialism is chiefly based on these."<ref>Satischandra Chatterjee and Dhirendramohan Datta. ''An Introduction to Indian Philosophy''. Eighth Reprint Edition. (University of Calcutta: 1984). p. 55.

Other Indian philosophies generally regarded as atheistic include [[Samkhya|Classical Samkhya]] and [[Mimamsa|Purva Mimamsa]].

Socrates (c. 471<U+2013>399 BCE) was associated in the Athenian public mind with the trends in pre-Socratic philosophy towards naturalistic inquiry and the rejection of divine explanations for phenomena. Although such an interpretation misrepresents his thought he was portrayed in such a way in Aristophanes' comic play ''Clouds'' and was later to be tried and executed for impiety and corrupting the young. At his trial Socrates is reported as vehemently denying that he was an atheist and contemporary scholarship provides little reason to doubt this claim.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bremmer|first=Jan|chapter=Atheism in Antiquity|postscript=,}} in {{harvnb|Martin|2006|pp=14<U+2013>19}}</ref><ref>

[[Euhemerus]] (c. 330<U+2013>260 BCE) published his view that the gods were only the deified rulers, conquerors and founders of the past, and that their cults and religions were in essence the continuation of vanished kingdoms and earlier political structures.<ref>Fragments of Euhemerus' work in Ennius' Latin translation have been preserved in [[Church Fathers|Patristic]] writings (e.g. by [[Lactantius]] and [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]), which all rely on earlier fragments in [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] 5,41<U+2013>46 & 6.1. Testimonies, especially in the context of polemical criticism, are found e.g. in [[Callimachus]], ''Hymn to Zeus'' 8.
</ref>
Although not strictly an atheist, Euhemerus was later criticized for having "spread atheism over the whole inhabited earth by obliterating the gods".<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Moralia<U+2014>Isis and Osiris'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/B.html#23 23]
</ref>

Also important in the history of atheism was Epicurus (c. 300 BCE). Drawing on the ideas of Democritus and the Atomists, he espoused a materialistic philosophy according to which the universe was governed by the laws of chance without the need for divine intervention. Although he stated that deities existed, he believed that they were uninterested in human existence. The aim of the Epicureans was to attain peace of mind and one important way of doing this was by exposing fear of divine wrath as irrational. The Epicureans also denied the existence of an afterlife and the need to fear divine punishment after death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/ |title=Epicurus (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-10}}</ref>

The Roman philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]] held that one should suspend judgment about virtually all beliefs<U+2014>a form of skepticism known as [[Pyrrhonism]]<U+2014>that nothing was inherently evil, and that [[ataraxia]] ("peace of mind") is attainable by withholding one's judgment. His relatively large volume of surviving works had a lasting influence on later philosophers.<ref name="gordonstein">Stein, Gordon (Ed.) (1980).

The meaning of "atheist" changed over the course of classical antiquity. The early Christians were labeled atheists by non-Christians because of their disbelief in pagan gods.<ref name="cathencyc-atheism">{{ws|"[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Atheism|Atheism]]" in the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia}}

During the [[Roman Empire]], Christians were executed for their rejection of the [[List of Roman deities|Roman gods]] in general and Emperor-worship in particular. When Christianity became the state religion of Rome under [[Theodosius I]] in 381, [[Christian heresy|heresy]] became a punishable offense.<ref>Maycock, A. L. and Ronald Knox (2003).

</ref>

===Early Middle Ages to the Renaissance===
The espousal of atheistic views was rare in Europe during the [[Early Middle Ages]] and [[Middle Ages]] (see [[Medieval Inquisition]]); [[metaphysics]], religion and theology were the dominant interests.<ref name="Zdybicka 2005 4">{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=4}}
</ref>
There were, however, movements within this period that forwarded heterodox conceptions of the Christian god, including differing views of the nature, transcendence, and knowability of God. Individuals and groups such as [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]], [[David of Dinant]], [[Amalric of Bena]], and the [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]] maintained Christian viewpoints with [[pantheism|pantheistic]] tendencies. [[Nicholas of Cusa]] held to a form of [[fideism]] he called ''[[De Docta Ignorantia|docta ignorantia]]'' ("learned ignorance"), asserting that God is beyond human categorization, and our knowledge of God is limited to conjecture. [[William of Ockham]] inspired anti-metaphysical tendencies with his [[nominalism|nominalistic]] limitation of human knowledge to singular objects, and asserted that the divine [[essence]] could not be intuitively or rationally apprehended by human intellect. Followers of Ockham, such as [[John of Mirecourt]] and [[Nicholas of Autrecourt]] furthered this view. The resulting division between faith and reason influenced later theologians such as [[John Wycliffe]], [[Jan Hus]], and [[Martin Luther]].<ref name="Zdybicka 2005 4"/>

The [[Renaissance]] did much to expand the scope of freethought and skeptical inquiry. Individuals such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] sought experimentation as a means of explanation, and opposed [[Appeal to authority|arguments from religious authority]]. Other critics of religion and the Church during this time included [[Niccol<U+00F2> Machiavelli]], [[Bonaventure des P<U+00E9>riers]], and [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Rabelais]].<ref name="gordonstein"/>

===Early modern period===
Historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]] wrote that the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] had paved the way for atheists by attacking the authority of the Catholic Church, which in turn "quietly inspired other thinkers to attack the authority of the new Protestant churches".<ref>Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.388</ref> [[Deism]] gained influence in France, Prussia, and England. The Dutch philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] was "probably the first well know 'semi-atheist' to announce himself in a Christian land in the modern era", according to Blainey. Spinoza believed that natural laws explained the workings of the universe. In 1661 he published his ''Short Treatise on God''.<ref>Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.343</ref>

[[Criticism of Christianity]] became increasingly frequent in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and England, where there appears to have been a religious [[malaise]], according to contemporary sources. Some Protestant thinkers, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], espoused a materialist philosophy and skepticism toward supernatural occurrences, while the Jewish-Dutch philosopher Spinoza rejected [[divine providence]] in favour of a [[panentheistic]] naturalism. By the late 17th century, deism came to be openly espoused by intellectuals such as [[John Toland (Irish Philosopher)|John Toland]] who coined the term "pantheist".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pantheism |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2013-11-26}}</ref>

The first known explicit atheist was the German critic of religion [[Matthias Knutzen]] in his three writings of 1674.<ref>Winfried Schr<U+00F6>der, in: Matthias Knutzen: Schriften und Materialien (2010), p. 8. See also Rececca Moore, ''The Heritage of Western Humanism, Scepticism and Freethought'' (2011), calling Knutzen "the first open advocate of a modern atheist perspective" [http://reason.sdsu.edu/germany.html online here]</ref> He was followed by two other explicit atheist writers, the Polish ex-Jesuit philosopher [[Kazimierz <U+0141>yszczy<U+0144>ski]] and in the 1720s by the French priest [[Jean Meslier]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nova.wpunj.edu/newpolitics/issue40/Onfray40.htm |title=Michel Onfray on Jean Meslier |publisher=William Paterson University |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref> In the course of the 18th century, other openly atheistic thinkers followed, such as [[Baron d'Holbach]], [[Jacques-Andr<U+00E9> Naigeon]], and other [[French materialism|French materialists]].<ref name=Holbach-SoN>{{cite book |last=d'Holbach |first=P.

The philosopher [[David Hume]] developed a skeptical epistemology grounded in empiricism, and [[Immanuel Kant]]'s philosophy has strongly questioned the very possibility of a metaphysical knowledge. Both philosophers undermined the metaphysical basis of natural theology and criticized classical [[arguments for the existence of God]]. However, they were not atheists themselves.

During the [[Reign of Terror|Terror of 1792<U+2013>93]], France's Christian calendar was abolished, monasteries, convents and church properties were seized and monks and nuns expelled. Historic churches were dismantled.<ref>Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; pp.397-8</ref> Blainey notes that, although [[Voltaire]] is widely considered to have strongly contributed to atheistic thinking during the Revolution, he also considered fear of God to have discouraged further disorder, having said "If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him."<ref>Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; pp.390-391</ref> In ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), the philosopher [[Edmund Burke]] denounced atheism, writing of a "literary cabal" who had "some years ago formed something like a regular plan for the destruction of the Christian religion. This object they pursued with a degree of zeal which hitherto had been discovered only in the propagators of some system of piety... These atheistical fathers have a bigotry of their own...".  But, Burke asserted, "man is by his constitution a religious animal" and "atheism is against, not only our reason, but our instincts; and... it cannot prevail long".<ref>[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/burke/edmund/reflections-on-the-revolution-in-france/ Reflections on the Revolution in France]; (1790) by [[Edmund Burke]]</ref>

[[File:Feuerbach Ludwig.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]]'s ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841) would greatly influence philosophers such as [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[David Strauss]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and [[Max Stirner]]. He considered God to be a human invention and religious activities to be wish-fulfillment. For this he is considered the founding father of modern [[anthropology of religion]].]]
The [[French Revolution]] took atheism and [[anticlericalism|anti-clerical]] deism outside the salons and into the public sphere.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} [[Baron d'Holbach]] was a prominent figure in the [[French Enlightenment]] who is best known for his atheism and for his voluminous writings against religion, the most famous of them being ''[[The System of Nature]]'' (1770) but also ''[[Christianity Unveiled]]''. A major goal of the French revolution was a restructuring and subordination of the clergy with respect to the state through the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]]. Attempts to enforce it led to anti-clerical violence and the expulsion of many clergy from France. The chaotic political events in revolutionary Paris eventually enabled the more radical [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]] to seize power in 1793, ushering in the [[Reign of Terror]]. The Jacobins were deists and introduced the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]] as a new French state religion. Some atheists surrounding [[Jacques H<U+00E9>bert]] instead sought to establish a [[Cult of Reason]], a form of atheistic pseudo-religion with a goddess personifying reason. Both movements in part contributed to attempts to forcibly de-Christianize France. The Cult of Reason ended after three years when its leadership, including Jacques H<U+00E9>bert, was guillotined by the Jacobins. The anti-clerical persecutions ended with the [[Thermidorian Reaction]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The [[Napoleonic era]] institutionalized the secularization of French society, and exported the revolution to northern Italy, in the hopes of creating pliable republics. In the 19th century, atheists contributed to political and social revolution, facilitating the [[Revolutions of 1848|upheavals of 1848]], the [[Italian unification|Risorgimento]] in Italy, and the growth of an international [[socialism|socialist]] movement.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In the latter half of the 19th century, atheism rose to prominence under the influence of [[rationalism|rationalistic]] and [[freethought|freethinking]] philosophers. Many prominent German philosophers of this era denied the existence of deities and were critical of religion, including [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Max Stirner]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=BKz2FcDrFy0C&pg=PA1&dq=nietzsche+schopenhauer+marx+feuerbach |title=Subjectivity and Irreligion: Atheism and Agnosticism in Kant, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |last=Ray |first=Matthew Alun |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7546-3456-0 | accessdate=2011-04-09}}

===Since 1900===

[[File:Lenin CL.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vladimir Lenin]], the first leader of the [[Soviet Union]]. [[Marxist<U+2012>Leninist atheism]] was influential in the 20th Century.]]

Atheism in the 20th century, particularly in the form of practical atheism, advanced in many societies. Atheistic thought found recognition in a wide variety of other, broader philosophies, such as [[existentialism]], [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|objectivism]], [[secular humanism]], [[nihilism]], [[anarchism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Marxism]], [[feminism]],<ref name=feminism>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=tAeFipOVx4MC&pg=PA233&lpg=PA233&dq=%22Feminism+and+Atheism%22&q=%22Feminism%20and%20Atheism%22 |last=Overall |first=Christine |chapter=Feminism and Atheism |year=2006 |accessdate=2011-04-09 |title=The Cambridge Companion to Atheism |isbn=9781139827393}} in {{harvnb|Martin|2006|pp=233<U+2013>246}}
</ref> and the general scientific and [[rationalist movement]].

Blainey wrote that during the twentieth century, atheists in Western societies became more active and even militant, though they often "relied essentially on arguments used by numerous radical Christians since at least the eighteenth century". They rejected the idea of an interventionist God, and said that Christianity promoted war and violence, though "the most ruthless leaders in the Second World War were atheists and secularists who were intensely hostile to both Judaism and Christianity" and "Later massive atrocities were committed in the East by those ardent atheists, [[Pol Pot]] and [[Mao Zedong]]". Some scientists were meanwhile articulating a view that as the world becomes more educated, religion will be superseded.<ref>[[Geoffrey Blainey]]; ''[[A Short History of Christianity]]''; Viking; 2011; p.543</ref>

Logical positivism and [[scientism]] paved the way for [[neopositivism]], [[analytical philosophy]], [[structuralism]], and [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]. Neopositivism and analytical philosophy discarded classical rationalism and metaphysics in favor of strict empiricism and epistemological [[nominalism]]. Proponents such as [[Bertrand Russell]] emphatically rejected belief in God. In his early work, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] attempted to separate metaphysical and supernatural language from rational discourse. [[A. J. Ayer]] asserted the unverifiability and meaninglessness of religious statements, citing his adherence to the empirical sciences. Relatedly the applied [[structuralism]] of [[Claude L<U+00E9>vi-Strauss|L<U+00E9>vi-Strauss]] sourced religious language to the human subconscious in denying its transcendental meaning. [[John Niemeyer Findlay|J. N. Findlay]] and [[J. J. C. Smart]] argued that the existence of God is not logically necessary. Naturalists and materialistic monists such as [[John Dewey]] considered the natural world to be the basis of everything, denying the existence of God or immortality.<ref name="stanford"/><ref>{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=16}}</ref>

====Emergence of state atheism under Communism====

[[File:Mao, Bulganin, Stalin, Ulbricht Tsedenbal.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Mao Zedong]] with [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1945. Both leaders repressed religion and established [[state atheism]] throughout their respective Communist spheres.]]

[[State atheism]] is the official promotion of atheism by a [[government]], sometimes combined with active suppression of [[religious freedom]] and practice.  In contrast, a [[secular state]] purports to be officially neutral in matters of [[religion]], supporting neither religion nor [[irreligion]].  State atheism may refer to a government's [[anti-clericalism]], (such as during the French Revolution) which opposes religious institutional power and influence in all aspects of public and political life, including the involvement of religion in the everyday life of the citizen.

The 20th century saw the political advancement of atheism, spurred on by interpretation of the works of [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] and the patronage of one-party Communist states. Historian Geoffrey Blainey notes that, although Christian principles had influenced some socialist thinking, they did not strongly influence the central figures in the revolution.<ref name=Blainey-2011-p492 /> The Soviet leaders [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] energetically pursued a campaign against religion, particularly Russian Orthodoxy.<ref name=Amis2003>Martin Amis; Koba the Dread; Vintage; 2003; pp.184-185</ref> Several other [[communist state]]s also opposed religion and mandated [[state atheism]],<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://rationalist.org.uk/627/the-perils-of-atheism |last=Baggini |first=Julian |title=The Perils of Atheism |publisher=New Humanist |volume=118 |issue=2 |date=Summer 2003 |accessdate=2013-11-21 |ref=harv}} Extract from his book ''Atheism: A Very Short Introduction'' (2003), Oxford University Press

[[Martin Amis]] wrote that from the beginning the [[Bolshevik]] line in the Soviet Union had been "militant atheism", but that it was not only the lynching, show-trials and executions of Russian Orthodox clergy for their links to [[Tsarism]] that was state policy, but also the "intention to stamp out private, even individual, worship too ('aiming to replace faith in God with faith in science and the machine')."<ref name=Amis2003 /> While the Soviet Constitution of 1936 guaranteed freedom to hold religious services, the [[Soviet state]] under [[Religion in the Soviet Union|Stalin's policy of state atheism]] did not consider education a private matter; it outlawed [[Religious education|religious instruction]] and waged campaigns to persuade people, at times violently, to abandon religion.<ref name="Liquidation">{{cite book|last=Simon|first=Gerhard

==New Atheism==
{{main|New Atheism}}

New Atheism is the name given to a movement among some early-21st-century atheist writers who have advocated the view that "religion should not simply be tolerated but should be countered, criticized, and exposed by rational argument wherever its influence arises."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/11/08/atheism.feature/index.html|title=The rise of the New Atheists|publisher=CNN|first=Simon|last=Hooper|accessdate=2010-03-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100408094135/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/11/08/atheism.feature/index.html| archivedate=2010-04-08 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}

The movement is commonly associated with [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Daniel C. Dennett]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Victor J.

These atheists generally seek to disassociate themselves from the mass political atheism that gained ascendency in various nations in the 20th century. In best selling books, the religiously motivated terrorist [[September 11 attacks|events of 9/11]] and the partially successful attempts of the [[Discovery Institute]] to change the American science curriculum to include [[creationist]] ideas, together with support for those ideas from [[George W. Bush]] in 2005, have been cited by authors such as Harris, Dennett, Dawkins, Stenger and Hitchens as evidence of a need to move society towards atheism.<ref name="sharedvalues">{{cite journal |url=http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/files/2012/02/13-Garfield-Book-2-Vol-33.pdf |title=Vermont Law Review |volume= 33 Book 2 |author=Alan E Garfield |title=Finding Shared Values in a Diverse Society: Lessons From the Intelligent Design Controversy |publisher=Vermont Law Review |accessdate=2013-11-21}}

[[Frank Sulloway]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and [[Michael Shermer]] of [[California State University]] conducted a study which found in their polling sample of "credentialed" U.S. adults (12% had Ph.Ds and 62% were college graduates) 64% believed in God, and there was a [[correlation]] indicating that religious conviction diminished with education level.{{sfn|Shermer|1999|pp=76<U+2013>79}}
In 1958, Professor [[Michael Argyle (psychologist)|Michael Argyle]] of the [[University of Oxford]] analyzed seven research studies that had investigated correlation between attitude to religion and [[Intelligence quotient|measured intelligence]] among school and college students from the U.S. Although a clear negative correlation was found, the analysis did not identify causality but noted that factors such as authoritarian family background and social class may also have played a part.<ref>{{cite book

The first takes the privative ''a'' both before the Greek ''theos'' (divinity) and ''gnosis'' (to know) to mean that atheism is simply the absence of belief in the gods and agnosticism is simply lack of knowledge of some specified subject matter. The second definition takes atheism to mean the explicit denial of the existence of gods and agnosticism as the position of someone who, because the existence of gods is unknowable, suspends judgment regarding them&nbsp;<U+2026> The first is the more inclusive and recognizes only two alternatives: Either one believes in the gods or one does not. Consequently, there is no third alternative, as those who call themselves agnostics sometimes claim. Insofar as they lack belief, they are really atheists. Moreover, since absence of belief is the cognitive position in which everyone is born, the burden of proof falls on those who advocate religious belief. The proponents of the second definition, by contrast, regard the first definition as too broad because it includes uninformed children along with aggressive and explicit atheists. Consequently, it is unlikely that the public will adopt it."</ref>
<ref name=eb2011-atheism>{{harvnb|Nielsen|2011}}: "Instead of saying that an atheist is someone who believes that it is false or probably false that there is a God, a more adequate characterization of atheism consists in the more complex claim that to be an atheist is to be someone who rejects belief in God for the following reasons&nbsp;<U+2026>: for an anthropomorphic God, the atheist rejects belief in God because it is false or probably false that there is a God; for a nonanthropomorphic God&nbsp;<U+2026> because the concept of such a God is either meaningless, unintelligible, contradictory, incomprehensible, or incoherent; for the God portrayed by some modern or contemporary theologians or philosophers&nbsp;<U+2026> because the concept of God in question is such that it merely masks an atheistic substance<U+2014>e.g., "God" is just another name for love, or&nbsp;<U+2026> a symbolic term for moral ideals."</ref>

<ref name=encyc-philosophy>{{harvnb|Edwards|2005}}: "On our definition, an 'atheist' is a person who rejects belief in God, regardless of whether or not his reason for the rejection is the claim that 'God exists' expresses a false proposition. People frequently adopt an attitude of rejection toward a position for reasons other than that it is a false proposition. It is common among contemporary philosophers, and indeed it was not uncommon in earlier centuries, to reject positions on the ground that they are meaningless. Sometimes, too, a theory is rejected on such grounds as that it is sterile or redundant or capricious, and there are many other considerations which in certain contexts are generally agreed to constitute good grounds for rejecting an assertion."</ref>

So an atheist is someone who disbelieves in God, whereas a theist is someone who believes in God. Another meaning of 'atheism' is simply nonbelief in the existence of God, rather than positive belief in the nonexistence of God.&nbsp;<U+2026> an atheist, in the broader sense of the term, is someone who disbelieves in every form of deity, not just the God of traditional Western theology."</ref>
<!--ref name=extreme-secularism>{{harvnb|Zuckerman|2010}}: "A major source of these biases is the lack of clear definitions. Atheism and secularity are defined in opposition to religion, with atheism (the rejection of theism) often perceived as an extreme form of secularism (the decline of religious influence over society). But atheism is a narrow term referring to a specific belief (that there is no god), whereas secularism has various meanings, including a range of attitudes (such as religious indifference, doubt, agnosticism, and atheism) as as behaviors (such as lack of regular church attendance or disregard for traditional religious morality)."</ref-->

However, this common contrast of agnosticism with atheism will hold only if one assumes that atheism means positive atheism. In the popular sense, agnosticism is compatible with negative atheism.

I usually reply with a question like, "Well, are you a Republican or an American?" The two words serve different concepts and are not mutually exclusive. Agnosticism addresses knowledge; atheism addresses belief. The agnostic says, "I don't have a knowledge that God exists." The atheist says, "I don't have a belief that God exists."
