The '''Republic of Indonesia''' ({{pron-en|<U+02CC><U+026A>ndo<U+028A><U+02C8>ni<U+02D0>zi<U+0259>}} or {{IPA-en|<U+02CC><U+026A>nd<U+0259><U+02C8>ni<U+02D0><U+0292><U+0259>|}}) ({{lang-id|Republik Indonesia}}), is a [[transcontinental country]] in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Oceania]]. Indonesia comprises [[Islands of Indonesia|17,508 islands]], and with an estimated population of around 237 million people, it is the world's fourth [[List of countries by population|most populous]] country, and has the [[List of Muslim majority countries|largest Muslim population]] in the world.

Indonesia is a [[republic]], with an elected legislature and [[President of Indonesia|president]]. The nation's capital city is [[Jakarta]]. The country shares land borders with [[Papua New Guinea]], [[East Timor]] and [[Indonesia-Malaysia border|Malaysia]]. Other neighboring countries include [[Singapore]], [[Philippines]], [[Australia-Indonesia border|Australia]], and the Indian territory of the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]].

The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the seventh century, when the [[Srivijaya|Srivijaya Kingdom]] traded with China and India. Local rulers gradually adopted Indian cultural, religious and political models from the early centuries [[Common Era|CE]], and [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] kingdoms flourished. Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources. Muslim traders brought [[Islam]], and [[Europe]]an powers fought one another to monopolize trade in the [[Spice Islands]] of [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] during the [[Age of Discovery]]. Following three and a half centuries of [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonialism]], Indonesia secured [[Indonesian Declaration of Independence|its independence]] after World War II. Indonesia's history has since been turbulent, with challenges posed by natural disasters, corruption, separatism, [[Reformation (Indonesia)|a democratization process]], and periods of rapid economic change.

Across its many islands, Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic, linguistic, and religious groups. The [[Javanese people|Javanese]] are the largest and most politically dominant ethnic group. Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by [[Indonesian language|a national language]], ethnic diversity, religious pluralism within a majority Muslim population, and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it.
Indonesia's national motto, ''"[[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika|Bhinneka tunggal ika]]"'' ("Unity in Diversity" ''literally,'' "many, yet one"), articulates the diversity that shapes the country. However, sectarian tensions and separatism have led to violent confrontations that have undermined political and economic stability. Despite its large population and densely populated regions, Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world's second highest level of [[biodiversity]]. The country is richly endowed with natural resources, yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia.

==Government and politics==
{{main|Politics of Indonesia}}

Indonesia is a [[republic]] with a [[presidential system]]. As a [[unitary state]], power is concentrated in the central government. Following the [[Indonesian Revolution of 1998|resignation of President Suharto]] in 1998, Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms. Four amendments to the [[Constitution of Indonesia|1945 Constitution of Indonesia]]<ref>In 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001</ref> have revamped the [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[Judiciary|judicial]], and [[Legislature|legislative]] branches.<ref name="Harijanti2006">{{cite journal |title=Indonesia: General elections test the amended Constitution and the new Constitutional Court |journal=International Journal of Constitutional Law |author=Susi Dwi Harijanti and Tim Lindsey |volume=4 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=138<U+2013>150 |doi=10.1093/icon/moi055}}</ref> The president of Indonesia is the [[head of state]], [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Military of Indonesia|Indonesian Armed Forces]], and the director of domestic governance, policy-making, and foreign affairs.

The highest representative body at national level is the [[People's Consultative Assembly]] (MPR).

Most civil disputes appear before a State Court; appeals are heard before the High Court. The Supreme Court is the country's highest court, and hears final cassation appeals and conducts case reviews. Other courts include the Commercial Court, which handles bankruptcy and insolvency; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law, general elections, dissolution of political parties, and the scope of authority of state institutions; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases.<ref name="USCONGRESS">{{cite web| title=Country Profile: Indonesia| publisher=[[Library of Congress|U.S Library of Congress]]| month=December | year=2004| url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Indonesia.pdf | format=PDF|accessdate=2006-12-09}}</ref>

==Administrative divisions==
{{main|Provinces of Indonesia|Administrative divisions of Indonesia}}
[[Image:Indonesia provinces english.png|right|thumb|Provinces of Indonesia]]
Administratively, Indonesia consists of [[Provinces of Indonesia|33 provinces]], five of which have special status. Each province has its own political legislature and governor. The provinces are subdivided into regencies (''[[Regencies of Indonesia|kabupaten]]'') and cities (''[[Cities of Indonesia|kota]]''), which are further subdivided into subdistricts (''[[Subdistricts of Indonesia|kecamatan]]''), and again into [[Village (Indonesia)|village groupings]] (either ''desa'' or ''kelurahan''). Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001, the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units, responsible for providing most government services. The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen's daily life, and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected ''lurah'' or ''kepala desa'' (village chief).

The provinces of [[Aceh]], [[Jakarta]], [[Yogyakarta (special region)|Yogyakarta]], [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]], and [[West Papua (Indonesian province)|West Papua]] have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces. The Acehnese government, for example, has the right to create an independent legal system; in 2003, it instituted a form of ''[[Sharia]]'' (Islamic law).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Michelle Ann Miller |title=The Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam law: a serious response to Acehnese separatism? |journal=Asian Ethnicity |volume=5 |issue=3 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/caet/2004/00000005/00000003/art00005 |year=2004 |pages=333&ndash;351 |doi=10.1080/1463136042000259789}}</ref> Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution.<ref>The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the [[Sultan of Yogyakarta]] and [[Pakualaman|Paku Alam]], respectively, much like a [[sultanate]].

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Indonesia}}
[[Image:WayangKulit Scene Zoom.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Wayang|Wayang kulit]] shadow puppet performance as seen by the audience]]
Indonesia has around 300 ethnic groups, each with [[Cultural identity|cultural differences]] developed over centuries, and influenced by Indian, [[Arab]]ic, Chinese, Malay, and European sources. Traditional Javanese and Balinese dances, for example, contain aspects of Hindu culture and mythology, as do ''[[Wayang|wayang kulit]]'' (shadow puppet) performances. Textiles such as [[batik]], [[ikat]] and [[songket]] are created across Indonesia in styles that vary by region. The most dominant influences on [[Indonesian architecture]] have traditionally been [[Indian architecture|Indian]]; however, Chinese, Arab, and European architectural influences have been significant. The most popular sports in Indonesia are [[badminton]] and [[football (soccer)|football]]; [[Liga Indonesia]] is the country's premier football club league. Traditional sports include ''[[sepak takraw]]'', and bull racing in Madura. In areas with a history of tribal warfare, mock fighting contests are held, such as, ''caci'' in [[Flores]], and ''[[pasola]]'' in [[Sumba]]. ''[[Pencak Silat]]'' is an Indonesian martial art.
