"'''Hey Baby'''" is a song written by [[Gwen Stefani]], [[Tony Kanal]], [[Tom Dumont]], and [[Bounty Killer]] for [[No Doubt]]'s fifth studio album ''[[Rock Steady (album)|Rock Steady]]'' (2001).  Released as the album's lead single, the song is heavily influenced by the Jamaican [[dancehall]] music present at No Doubt's post-show parties and tour bus lounges of their ''[[Return of Saturn]]'' tour.<ref name="singles"/>  Its lyrics describe the debauchery with [[groupie]]s at these parties.

The song received positive reviews from music critics, though the song's dancehall influences had a mixed reception.  It was released as the album's [[lead single]] in October 2001 (see [[2001 in music]]).  The single was commercially successful and peaked at number five on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].  At the [[45th Grammy Awards]], "Hey Baby" won a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]].

== Background and writing ==
"Hey Baby" was one of the first songs written for ''Rock Steady''.<ref>"No Doubt".  ''Front Row Center''.  [[Fox Family]].  February 18, 2002.</ref>  The song began with instrumentals programmed with producer [[Philip Steir]] at Toast Studios in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].<ref name="singles">Montoya, Paris and Lanham, Tom.

November 25, 2003.</ref>  They experimented with [[raygun]]-like electronic effects and sounds that guitarist [[Tom Dumont]] compared to [[Star Wars Music|''Star Wars'' music]].<ref>"No Doubt".  ''Mean Street''.  Volume 12, issue 6.  December 2001.</ref>  The lyrics and melodies were recorded at a session at Dumont's home studio in [[Los Angeles]] weeks later.  While the band was working on the album in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], Jamaica during March 2001, producers Sly & Robbie left the percussion and [[Gwen Stefani]]'s original vocal.<ref name="singles"/>  The band asked about adding a guest appearance on the song, so Sly & Robbie recommended and added a [[Deejaying|toast]] from Bounty Killer.<ref>Reid, Nadine.

Like the song's dancehall style, the lyrics depict the band's post-show parties from touring in support of ''Return of Saturn''.  The song details female groupies who attended the parties to hook up with the male band members.  Stefani commented that "if you're talented and you're up there, girls want to make out with you."  Bassist Tony Kanal described it as "a very [[MPAA film rating system#Ratings|PG]] version" of the licentiousness that took place while touring.<ref>Wiederhorn, Jon and Rankin, Rebecca.

Retrieved July 12, 2007.</ref>  The song also touches on ''Rock Steady''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s overall theme of Stefani's impatience in her [[long-distance relationship]] with then-boyfriend [[Gavin Rossdale]], as she sits "sipping on chamomile/watching boys and girls and their sex appeal".<ref name="slant">Cinquemani, Sal.

The song opens with an [[introduction (music)|introduction]] consisting of a sustained [[bar (music)|measure]] of electronic effects followed by two lines from the [[refrain|chorus]].  In each two-measure line during the first half of the verses, Stefani descends the scale while the keyboard plays the [[off-beat (music)|off-beats]] of the first measure and the [[bass guitar|electric bass]] opens the line with a two-note [[bassline]].  During the second half of the verses, Stefani's vocals are [[overdubbed]], and the instrumentation becomes more frequent.<ref>Guitar tab for "Hey Baby".  [[Hal Leonard Corporation]].  2001.</ref>  Each of the two verses is followed by the chorus, where overdubbing is used on Stefani's vocals to produce [[first inversion]] and normal form [[E minor]] chords.

The song's [[music video]], directed by [[Dave Meyers (director)|Dave Meyers]], follows the theme of the lyrics. It shows the band on a tour bus, stopping at a party at Club Poonani. The members separate when three girls approach the male band members. Kanal has his picture taken with several women, paying for it by taking money that drummer [[Adrian Young]] earns by hanging from [[gymnastics rings]] naked. Dumont defeats a woman, portrayed by Sonya Eddy, in an endurance [[drinking game]], and Stefani dances, eventually joining Bounty Killer on stage.<ref name="video">"Hey Baby".
