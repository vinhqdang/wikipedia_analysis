'''Roy Kilner''' (17 October 1890 <U+2013> 5 April 1928) was an English professional [[cricket]]er who played nine [[Test cricket|Test matches]] for [[England cricket team|England]] between 1924 and 1926. An [[all-rounder]], he played for [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club]] between 1911 and 1927. In all [[first-class cricket|first-class matches]], he scored 14,707 [[Run (cricket)|runs]] at an [[Batting average#Cricket|average]] of 30.01 and took 1,003 [[Wicket#Dismissing a batsman|wickets]] at an [[Bowling average|average]] of 18.45. Kilner scored 1,000 runs in a season ten times and took 100 wickets in a season five times. On four occasions, he completed the [[Double (cricket)|double]].

Kilner first played for Yorkshire as a [[Batting (cricket)|batsman]] before the First World War, establishing a regular place in the side. After being wounded in the war, he returned in 1919 to a Yorkshire side which was short of [[Bowler (cricket)|bowlers]]. As a result, Kilner began to practise his bowling to the point where he became highly regarded as a [[Left-arm orthodox spin|slow left-arm bowler]]. His form brought selection by England in 1924 and a visit to Australia for the [[The Ashes|Ashes]] tour of 1924<U+2013>25. Although the second most successful bowler on the tour, his bowling subsequently declined in effectiveness, and did not trouble batsmen on good pitches. He was selected during the 1926 Ashes but dropped for the final Test. Kilner went on several coaching trips to India during English winters, and on one of these, in 1927<U+2013>28, he contracted an illness; on his return to England, he died at age 37. His funeral was attended by over 100,000 people and there was widespread sadness at his death. He was a popular player with both cricketers and spectators due to his attacking batting and his warm personality.

==Early life==
Kilner was born on 17 October 1890 in [[Wombwell]], [[Barnsley]], [[Yorkshire]], England, the second son and one of eleven children of Seth Kilner and Mary Alice Washington.<ref>Pope, p. 2.</ref> The Kilners attended Wombwell Parish Church and the boys were members of [[Church Lads' and Church Girls' Brigade|the Church Lads' Brigade]].<ref name=p4>Pope, p. 4.</ref> His father and his uncle, [[Irving Washington (cricketer)|Irving Washington]], the former [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] cricketer, encouraged him to play the sport from an early age. Displaying ability, Kilner played for the local [[colliery]] team, Mitchell Main. His brother, [[Norman Kilner|Norman]] also played cricket, representing Yorkshire and later [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]].<ref name=p4/>

In 1904, aged 14, Kilner first played for the Mitchell Main first team, appearing in two games without success.<ref name=p4/> Although selected regularly from the 1905 season, Kilner usually failed when batting. He displayed aggression, attempting too many difficult shots and [[Wicket#Dismissing a batsman|losing his wicket]]. His bowling was more effective but used infrequently.<ref>Pope, p. 6.</ref> It was not until the 1909 season that his batting developed. He scored his first [[Century (cricket)|century]] for the team and began to make consistently good scores, attracting the attention of Yorkshire.<ref>Pope, pp. 6<U+2013>7.</ref>

==First years at Yorkshire==
===Debut for Yorkshire===
After scoring a second century for Mitchell Main at the start of the [[1910 English cricket season|1910 season]], Kilner was chosen to play for Yorkshire Second XI. In his first season, he took just three [[Wicket#Dismissing a batsman|wickets]] and had a [[Batting average#Cricket|batting average]] of 12.50, although he continued to do well for Mitchell Main.<ref>Pope, pp. 8<U+2013>9.</ref> For the [[1911 English cricket season|1911 season]], Yorkshire sent Kilner to play for Harrogate Cricket Club which provided a higher standard of cricket: the county had a system whereby promising young players were sent to gain experience in competitive matches for local clubs.<ref>{{Cite web| last = Sellers | first = AB | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152872.html| title = Rebuilding Yorkshire Cricket | work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1948| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 10 September 2010}}</ref> Kilner began to record good batting and bowling performances. Although his form for Yorkshire Second XI was more inconsistent, he made his first-class debut for Yorkshire that season against [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] in the [[County Championship]]. He scored 0 and 14 and did not bowl.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/8/8383.html| title = Somerset v Yorkshire in 1911| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 21 March 2010}}</ref> In a further six matches for Yorkshire in 1911, his highest innings was 18 [[Run (cricket)|runs]], his average with the bat was just 6.66 in ten innings and he did not take any wickets.<ref name=fcbatting>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/433/f_Batting_by_Season.html| title = First-class Batting and Fielding in Each Season by Roy Kilner| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 21 March 2010}}</ref><ref name=fcbowling>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/433/f_Bowling_by_Season.html| title = First-class Bowling in Each Season by Roy Kilner| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 21 March 2010}}</ref> For Harrogate, he was more successful, with 519 runs and 28 wickets.<ref>Pope, p. 10.</ref>

===Yorkshire regular===
At the beginning of the [[1912 English cricket season|1912 season]], Kilner showed good form for Yorkshire Second XI. In two games, he scored centuries, going on to take twelve wickets for 75 runs in the second match.<ref name=p12>Pope, p. 12.</ref> These performances, coupled with his continued good form for Harrogate, led to Kilner's recall to the Yorkshire first team in June. He replaced the injured [[all-rounder]] [[George Hirst]] for the match against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]].<ref>Pope, p. 11.</ref> On the first morning, Kilner was used as the sixth bowler and proved successful; he finished with four wickets for 66 runs. Although failing to score in the first innings, he came in to bat in the second innings with Yorkshire 133 for four, needing 249 for victory. He shared a [[Partnership (cricket)|partnership]] of 113 for the fifth wicket and scored 83 [[not out]] to take Yorkshire to a five wicket win.<ref name=p12/><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/8/8736.html| title = Nottinghamshire v Yorkshire in 1912| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 21 March 2010}}</ref> This performance kept Kilner in the team for the remainder of the season, even after Hirst's return, ending his appearances for the second team. He played 23 times for Yorkshire, who subsequently won the County Championship.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=P14>Pope, p. 14.</ref> He scored 570 runs at an average of 22.80 and took 16 wickets at an [[Bowling average|average]] of 22.12, figures regarded as respectable for a first full season.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/><ref name=P14/> Apart from one game in the [[1913 English cricket season|1913 season]], he ceased playing for Harrogate. In his years there, he scored 967 runs, averaging 38.68, and took 71 wickets at an average of less than ten runs per wicket.<ref name=P14/>

The 1913 season saw Kilner score 1,586 at an average of 34.47, which remained his highest seasonal aggregate of runs and placed him third in the Yorkshire batting averages.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/1913_f_Batting_by_Average.html| title = First-class Batting and Fielding for Yorkshire in 1913| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 28 March 2010}}</ref> He also took 18 wickets at 25.22.<ref name=fcbowling/> At the end of May and beginning of June, Kilner took part in century partnerships in four consecutive matches, culminating in his maiden first-class century against [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]].<ref name=fcmatches>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/433/First-Class_Matches.html| title = First-Class Matches played by Roy Kilner| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 24 March 2010}}</ref><ref name=Leic1913>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/9/9018.html| title = Yorkshire v Leicestershire in 1913| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 24 March 2010}}</ref> During his innings of 104, he hit 18 [[Boundary (cricket)#Scoring Runs|fours]] and shared a partnership of 184 in under two hours with his close friend [[Major Booth]], rescuing Yorkshire from 58 for five and taking the score to 300.<ref name=P14/><ref name=Leic1913/> Throughout the season, he played several valuable innings when his side was under pressure. His batting was always adventurous and attacking although he often made uncertain starts to his innings and showed impatience. The strength and variety of the Yorkshire bowling attack meant his left-arm spin was not often required.<ref>Pope, p. 17.</ref> Even so, Yorkshire dropped to second in the Championship.<ref name=ccposn>{{Cite book| title = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| edition = 2010| publisher = John Wisden & Co| chapter = LV County Championship: County Championship Final Positions 1890&ndash;2010| page = 574}}</ref>

An illness during the winter of 1913<U+2013>14 took its toll on Kilner at the start of the [[1914 English cricket season|1914 season]].<ref>Pope, pp. 18<U+2013>19.</ref> He passed 1,000 runs for the second time but due to his uncertain form, his aggregate of runs and his average both fell. He scored 1,329 runs (average 30.90), placing him fourth in the Yorkshire batting averages.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=P21>Pope, p. 21.</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/1914_f_Batting_by_Average.html| title = First-class Batting and Fielding for Yorkshire in 1914| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 28 March 2010}}</ref> His bowling was rarely used and he took just one wicket.<ref name=fcbowling/><ref name=P21/> Kilner scored his second first-class century against [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]] late in the season; he made 169 in nearly three and a half hours, hitting 28 fours.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/9/9440.html| title = Gloucestershire v Yorkshire in 1914| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 25 March 2010}}</ref> His team finished fourth in the table.<ref name=ccposn/>

==First World War==
The United Kingdom declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914, while Kilner was playing in that season's [[Roses Match]] at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/9/9401.html|title=Lancashire v Yorkshire in 1914| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 24 September 2010}}</ref> Initially the government requested that cricket should continue, though several cricketers with existing military obligations, including Yorkshire's captain, [[Archibald White|Sir Archibald White]], were called up immediately.  As the fighting started, and casualties began to mount, public opinion turned against the continuation of the season, and Yorkshire's match against Sussex at Hove, which concluded on 1 September, [[Cricket in the Great War|proved to be the last County Championship match until 1919]]. The newspaper ''Cricket'' reported "The men's hearts were barely in the game, and the match was given up as a draw at tea."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/420981.html |title=Duty calls |publisher=ESPNCricinfo |last=Williamson |first=Martin |date=21 August 2009|accessdate=24 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/9/9454.html|title=Sussex v Yorkshire in 1914| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 24 September 2010}}</ref>  With the suspension of the championship, Kilner and Major Booth enlisted in the army together, joining the [[Leeds Pals|Leeds and Bradford "Pals"]] in the [[West Yorkshire Regiment]].<ref name="P21"/>  Kilner trained as a mechanic before being stationed at [[Colsterdale]] in North Yorkshire as a Corporal.<ref name=P25/><ref name=P21-22>Pope, pp. 21<U+2013>22.</ref> While on leave in November 1914, Kilner married Annie Campbelljohn<U+2014>the daughter of James Campbelljohn, an engineer<U+2014>at Wombwell Parish Church; Booth served as best man.<ref name=P21-22/> While the war was taking place, Annie gave birth to the couple's first child, Roy junior.<ref name=P22/> Kilner was posted with his battalion to Egypt but was forced home with an injury. On recovery, he was sent to fight on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in France.<ref name=P22>Pope, p. 22.</ref> During [[the Battle of the Somme]], he was wounded shortly before his battalion engaged in the fighting, receiving a shrapnel wound in the wrist; later in the same action, Booth was killed.<ref name=P22/><ref name=coy>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154716.html| title = Roy Kilner <U+2013> Bowler of the Year 1924| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1924| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 28 March 2010}}</ref> Kilner recovered in a military hospital near Blackpool before being assigned to Preston Garrison as a mechanic.<ref name=P25/><ref name=P22/> Before the war ended, Kilner suffered a second loss when his brother Bernard was killed at [[Ypres]] in 1917.<ref name=P25/><ref>{{cwgc|id=447124|name=Kilner, B|accessdate=24 September 2010}}</ref>

Having previously shown his [[Association football|footballing]] ability for Mitchell Main in the winter of 1912<U+2013>13,<ref name=P14/> Kilner resumed his career in the sport while posted at Preston during the war. He played as a [[Defender (association football)#Full back|right-back]] for [[Preston North End F.C.]], a team which won promotion from the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1915, but only took their place in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] when league football resumed in 1919. Sometimes playing under the name of Smith to avoid detection (although it is not certain why he did so), his first certain appearance for the team was in September 1918. However, it is unclear how often he actually represented the club.<ref name=P25>Pope, p. 25.</ref><ref>{{Cite news| title = League Football {{subscription}} | newspaper = The Times  | location = London  | page =  5 | date = 25 August 1919 | url = http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?toDate=1919-12-31&fromDate=1918-09-01&currentPageNumber=2&resultsPerPage=10&sortBy=%2Barchiveissuedate&offset=0&viewName=&addFilters=&removeFilters=&addCat=&queryKeywords=Preston+North+End&sectionId=1040&currPgSmartSet=1&pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1919-08-25-05&articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1919-08-25-05-002&origPageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1919-08-25-05&origArticleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1919-08-25-05-002&xmlpath=&pubId=17&totalResults=52&addRefineFilters=@archivearticlecategories%3ASport&removeRefineFilters=&addRefineCat=&additionalKeyword=&next_Page=true&prev_Page=false&date_dd_From=1&date_mm_From=09&date_yyyy_From=1918&date_dd_to_range=31&date_mm_to_range=12&date_yyyy_to_range=1919&date_dd_from_precise=1&date_mm_from_precise=09&date_yyyy_from_precise=1918&isDateSearch=false&dateSearchType=range&refineQuerykeywordText= | accessdate = 10 August 2010}}</ref>

==First-class career after the war==
===From batsman to bowler===
When cricket resumed after the war in [[1919 English cricket season|1919]], County Championship matches were reduced from three days to two in a one-season experiment. Following the deaths of Booth in the war and [[Alonzo Drake]] from illness, as well as the decline in the bowling of the aging George Hirst, Yorkshire lacked an effective attack. Subsequently, Kilner was asked to deliver more overs, although not to the extent of a main bowler.<ref name=coy/><ref name=P26>Pope, pp. 26<U+2013>27.</ref> He took 45 wickets, more than his entire first-class wicket aggregate before the war, at an average of 18.12. This placed him third in the Yorkshire averages.<ref name=fcbowling/><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/1920_f_Bowling_by_Average.html| title = First-class Bowling for Yorkshire in 1920| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 28 March 2010}}</ref> With the bat he scored three centuries and reached 1,135 runs at 29.10.<ref name=fcbatting/> His performances earned his selection for the [[Gentlemen v Players|Players against the Gentlemen]] in the end of season festival match at Scarborough, although he neither took a wicket nor scored.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/9/9707.html| title = Gentlemen v Players in 1919| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 28 March 2010}}</ref> Kilner's brother Norman first played for Yorkshire in 1919, although he was ultimately unable to secure a permanent place in the team.<ref name=P26/>

Kilner began the [[1920 English cricket season|1920 season]] with an innings of 206 [[not out]] in his first match, against [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]], and the effort remained the highest score of his career. He batted for four hours, hitting 24 fours and two [[Boundary (cricket)#Scoring Runs|sixes]].<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/9/9768.html| title = Yorkshire v Derbyshire in 1920| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 28 March 2010}}</ref> He could have been caught when he had scored around fifty, but a local newspaper described the innings as brilliant, his [[Batting (cricket)#Drive|driving]] and [[Batting (cricket)#Pull and hook|pulling]] being particularly effective.<ref>Pope, p. 28.</ref> Kilner appeared in one representative match: at the end-of-season [[Scarborough Festival]], he played for CI Thornton's XI against the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (M.C.C.) side which visited Australia in the winter<U+2014>at the time, the M.C.C. administered English cricket, and the [[England cricket team|England team]] toured under its name.<ref name=fcmatches/><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/9/9978.html| title = CI Thornton's XI v Marylebone Cricket Club Australian Touring Team in 1920| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 28 March 2010}}</ref> In total, he scored 1,316 runs at an average of 37.09 with two more centuries, placing him second in the Yorkshire averages.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/1920_f_Batting_by_Average.html| title = First-class Batting and Fielding for Yorkshire in 1920| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 28 March 2010}}</ref> With the ball, he took 27 wickets but his average of 25.33 was relatively high.<ref name=fcbowling/><ref name=P29>Pope, p. 29.</ref> The county finished fourth in the Championship as Middlesex were crowned winners.<ref name=ccposn/> Critics believed Kilner should have bowled more frequently, an opinion shared by [[Wilfred Rhodes]], Yorkshire's main [[Left-arm orthodox spin|slow left-arm spinner]]. Conscious of his increasing age, the 42-year-old Rhodes wanted support with the bowling workload; he considered Kilner the best option and encouraged him to improve his left-arm spin.<ref name=P29/> Consequently, during the winter, Kilner spent a lot of time practising in the yard of the Wombwell hotel where his father was landlord.<ref name=P29/> Around the same time he celebrated the birth of his second son, named Major after Major Booth.<ref>Pope, pp. 29<U+2013>30.</ref>

Kilner's bowling had greater success in [[1921 English cricket season|1921]], helping Yorkshire to rise to third in the Championship.<ref name=ccposn/> Used more regularly, he took 61 wickets (average 18.80),<ref name=fcbowling/> including his first [[Glossary_of_cricket_terms#F|five wicket hauls in an innings]], against [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] and Nottinghamshire.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/10/10148.html| title = Yorkshire v Warwickshire in 1921| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 28 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/10/10228.html| title = Nottinghamshire v Yorkshire in 1921| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 28 March 2010}}</ref> He scored 1,137 runs at an average of 27.73.<ref name=fcbatting/> He made centuries in the two matches against [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]], sharing big partnerships in both games: 276 with Rhodes in the first and 299 with [[Percy Holmes]] in the second.<ref name=P30>Pope, p. 30.</ref> His overall performance left him sixth in the Yorkshire batting averages, while he finished fourth in the bowling averages.<ref group="note">The placings for Yorkshire bowling averages include only bowlers who took ten wickets or more and batsmen who played ten innings.</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/1921_f_Batting_by_Average.html| title = First-class Batting and Fielding for Yorkshire in 1921| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 28 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/1921_f_Bowling_by_Average.html| title = First-class Bowling for Yorkshire in 1921| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 28 March 2010}}</ref> Through the winter, he continued to develop his bowling.<ref name=P30/>

===Established all-rounder===
By [[1922 English cricket season|1922]], Kilner's bowling had improved to the point where he passed 100 wickets in the season for the first time, taking 122 at an average of 14.72,<ref name=fcbowling/> helping Yorkshire to win the County Championship.<ref name=P32/> ''Wisden'' recognised this was the first season when he was a front-line bowler, "[leaving] his previous form far behind."<ref name=coy/> In the first five games of the campaign, he took 21 wickets for 142 runs.<ref name=P32>Pope, p. 32.</ref> In the match against [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]], he claimed ten wickets in a match for the first time, taking eleven for 51 runs.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/10/10540.html| title = Yorkshire v Essex in 1922| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 31 March 2010}}</ref> Against [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]], he took ten wickets for 90 runs, including six for 13 in the second innings as Hampshire were bowled out for 44.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/10/10621.html| title = Hampshire v Yorkshire in 1922| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 31 March 2010}}</ref> At the same time, he maintained his batting form and a similar record to the previous season.

Although his poor batting meant his form as an all-rounder was disappointing, he had a very good season as a bowler. Nevertheless, his selection to tour Australia that winter with the M.C.C. team surprised commentators.<ref name=P40/>

===Tour of Australia===
Playing for M.C.C. under the captaincy of [[Arthur Gilligan]], Kilner made 103 against [[Western Warriors|Western Australia]] on his maiden first-class appearance in Australia.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/11/11367.html| title = Western Australia v Marylebone Cricket Club in 1924/25| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 11 April 2010}}</ref> He continued to show good all-round form in the less important, non first-class matches, but in first-class matches leading up to the Tests he was less successful.

Australia batted first and scored 489, a total which looked unlikely when they lost three wickets for 22 and later six wickets for 119. England's pace bowlers, Gilligan and [[Maurice Tate]], had to leave the field injured, allowing Australia to recover; later the spinner [[Tich Freeman]] hurt his wrist and could not bowl.<ref name=3T>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151701.html| title = Australia v England 1924<U+2013>25| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1926| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 13 April 2010}}</ref> The only fit front-line bowlers remaining were Kilner and [[Frank Woolley]].<ref name=tourrep>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/155203.html| title = M.C.C. team in Australia 1924<U+2013>25| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1926| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 13 April 2010}}</ref> England fielded for nearly nine hours, and Kilner bowled 56 eight-[[Delivery (cricket)|ball]] overs to take four for 127, his first wicket in Test matches being [[Arthur Richardson (Australian cricketer)|Arthur Richardson]].<ref name="3rd test">{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/11/11402.html| title = Australia v England in 1924/25| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 13 April 2010}}</ref> Given the injuries, Gilligan later said Kilner gave "a truly great performance".<ref name=P41>Pope, p. 41.</ref> England could not match Australia's total, scoring only 365, but when the hosts batted again, rain fell and affected the pitch, making it responsive to spin bowling.

In the fourth Test, which England won comfortably, Kilner scored 79, his highest Test score, adding 133 with [[Dodger Whysall]], the largest partnership of the match.

===Decline as a bowler===
During [[1925 English cricket season|1925]], Kilner was awarded a [[Benefit (sports)|benefit match]] and had an improved batting record for the season but critics began to notice a decline in his bowling. He was effective on pitches which favoured spin bowlers, but not on the flatter pitches prevalent in the dry summer of 1925.<ref>Woodhouse, p. 338.</ref> Cricket journals, such as ''[[The Cricketer]]'', criticised his tendency to bowl [[leg theory]]&mdash;tactic regarded as negative and overly defensive&mdash;when confronted with batting-friendly conditions.<ref name=P43>Pope, p. 43.</ref> He took 131 wickets at 17.92, finishing second in the Yorkshire averages and helping his team to their fourth successive County Championship.<ref name=fcbowling/><ref name=P43/><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/1925_f_Bowling_by_Average.html| title = First-class Bowling for Yorkshire in 1925| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 14 April 2010}}</ref> He scored 1,068 runs at an average of 30.51 with two centuries.

In the winter of 1925<U+2013>26, Kilner was selected for the M.C.C. tour of the West Indies, during which no Test matches were played.

===Death===
The Maharaja of Patiala again invited Kilner to play and coach in India in the winter of 1927<U+2013>28.<ref name=P48/> Kilner's sister Mollie later claimed he was very reluctant to take up the invitation and hesitated before accepting.<ref name=P50>Pope, p. 50.</ref> The trip started badly when Kilner's uncle, Irving Washington, died the day after he departed, and several of Kilner's actions suggested he was suffering from some form of depression while in India.<ref name=P50/> Despite this, Kilner recorded several large scores, including an unbeaten 283 in one (non first-class) match.<ref name=P50/> Near the end of trip, Kilner began to suffer from a fever. His Yorkshire team mates, [[Arthur Dolphin]] and [[Maurice Leyland]], who were also in India, believed he became unwell after eating oysters. However, it is not certain how or when Kilner became ill. He began to have shivering attacks and perspirations while travelling from Marseilles on the way home.<ref name=P50/> It was obvious he was seriously ill when he arrived in Southampton; a cricketing engagement was cancelled and he was confined to bed.<ref>Pope, pp. 51<U+2013>52</ref> He refused treatment in Southampton, wishing to return to his family, and asking for his wife.<ref name=P52/> Arriving in Wombwell on 27 March 1928, he was examined by his doctor and taken home. Subsequently, his condition deteriorated and he was taken to [[Kendray]] Fever Hospital, near Barnsley. Although it was thought he had passed the worst, his condition became critical in the first few days of April. On 5 April 1928, aged just 37, Kilner died from [[Typhoid fever|enteric fever]] in the presence of his wife.<ref name=obit/><ref name=P52>Pope, p. 52.</ref>

The town of Wombwell expressed enormous sympathy and tributes came from around the world. When Kilner's funeral took place on 10 April, the streets were packed with mourners. Many came from outside the town, and contemporary estimates suggested 100,000 people were present to pay tribute to Kilner, although there may have been more.<ref name=P54>Pope, p. 54.</ref> Over a thousand people were at the cemetery for the burial, and Yorkshire cricketers carried the coffin.<ref>Pope, pp. 54<U+2013>55</ref> Two years later, the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1930|Australian team which toured England in 1930]] visited Kilner's grave in Wombwell to lay a wreath.<ref>Pope, pp. xiii, 57.</ref> The rector at the funeral said in his tribute "A Yorkshire wicket has fallen and one of Yorkshire's best men is out; and we lament his loss; not merely because it is the loss of a great cricketer, but because it is the loss of such a cricketer as Roy Kilner was."<ref name=P54/>

==Style and personality==
Kilner first came into the Yorkshire side as a batsman. He was considered a good, reliable batsman when he began, although his style was regarded by Yorkshire critics as unorthodox to the point where they disapproved of some of his unusual, eccentric shots.<ref name=H92>Hodgson, p. 92.</ref> For Yorkshire, he appeared high in the [[batting order (cricket)|order]], but batted between number seven and number nine for England.<ref name=tpos/><ref>{{Cite book|last = Marshall |first = Michael |title = Gentlemen and Players. Conversations with Cricketers  |publisher = Grafton Books |year = 1987 |location= London  |isbn = 0246118741 | page = 38}}</ref> If the circumstances of the game demanded it, he was able to play slowly and defensively and restrain his naturally aggressive style. He was particularly effective while playing the [[Batting (cricket)#Drive|drive]] and [[Batting (cricket)#Pull and hook|pull shot]]. For most of his career, his effectiveness as a batsman was not compromised by his improvement and increasing workload as a bowler.<ref name=obit/><ref name=timesobit/>

In terms of bowling, Kilner was an effective performer on rain affected pitches.<ref name=H92/> His accuracy also enabled him to bowl on good pitches without the batsmen being able to score too many runs.<ref name=obit/> In 1923, journalist [[Alfred Pullin]] said Kilner spun the ball more than any other English bowler. He noted, as did ''Wisden'', how Kilner often bowled [[Cricket terminology#O|over the wicket]], meaning he bowled from the right hand side of the wickets, unusual for a left-arm spinner in this period.<ref name=coy/><ref name=P35/> This established a contrast with his fellow left-arm spinner, Wilfred Rhodes, and increased their effectiveness. Furthermore, it allowed him to surprise batsmen with a different delivery, such as one [[arm ball|which did not turn]].<ref>Pope, pp. 35<U+2013>36.</ref> Kilner's ''Wisden'' portrait also credited him with the gift of imagination, describing how he always tried to think of new ways to beat and dismiss batsmen.<ref name=coy/> He would experiment with his bowling, for example altering his pace slightly, if conditions were unfavourable towards bowlers.<ref name=obit/> Kilner delivered [[Left-arm unorthodox spin|left-arm wrist spin]] at times, constantly practising it in the [[cricket nets]]. His brother Norman believed Roy was the person who coined the term "chinaman" to describe such a style, although other players have also claimed to originate the phrase.<ref name=P30/>

At a time when the Yorkshire team was successful but exhibited a grim and determined attitude, Kilner was very popular with spectators. They liked him for his cheerfulness and desire to entertain, an attitude not shared by all of his team-mates.<ref name=P35/> He had many friends in the game at a time when Yorkshire were not always welcome in other counties due to their on-field attitude.<ref name=obit/><ref name=H92/> When he was chosen as a Bowler of the Year in 1924, ''Wisden'' remarked that he was devoted to the game, possessed a cheery temperament and stood out among players for his personality,<ref name=coy/> while his obituary described him as modest and generous.<ref name=obit/> His ''Times'' obituary described him as "not only a notable exponent of the game, but a man of rare charm. Few modern professionals commanded such a measure of esteem and kindly regard from his own immediate colleagues and his opponents in the cricket field as did Roy Kilner".<ref name=timesobit>{{Cite news| title = Death of R.

Kilner was a favourite of cricket writer [[Neville Cardus]], who attributed several sayings to him in his prose. For example, Cardus described Kilner as saying about Yorkshire and Lancashire matches at the time: "What we want is no umpires and fair cheating all round," and "We say good morning and after that all we say is 'Howzat?'"<ref name=H93>Hodgson, p. 93.</ref> Also, when asked about contemporary problems in the game, in particular the negative attitude of some teams, he replied the game was fine, it was "t'crowd that wants educating up to it."<ref name=H93/>
