Shakur was arrested for the first time in 1967 with 100 other Manhattan Community College students, on charges of [[trespass]]ing.

:"The basic problem stemmed from the fact that the BPP had no systematic approach to political education.

===Bronx bank robbery trials===
In her 1973 trial for a September 29, 1972 $3,700 robbery of the [[Manufacturer's Hanover Trust Company]] in the Bronx, Shakur and her co-defendant Kamau Sadiki (born Fred Hilton) represented themselves while their lawyers stayed mute, in protest of Judge Gagliardi allotting them what they perceived to be insufficient time for a proper defense.<ref name="p81">Perkins, 2000, p. 81.</ref><ref>''The New York Times''.

The state's case rested largely on the testimony of two men who had pleaded guilty to participating in the holdup.<ref>''The New York Times''. (December 30, 1973). "Chesimard Acquitted". p. 104.</ref> The prosecution called four witnesses: Avon White and John Rivers (both of whom had already been convicted of the robbery) and the manager and teller of the bank.<ref name="prial">Prial, Frank J.

''The New York Times'', p. 54.</ref> White and Rivers, although convicted, had not yet been sentenced for the robbery and were promised that the charges would be dropped in exchange for their testimony.<ref name="prial"/> White and Rivers testified that Shakur had guarded one of the doors with a [[.357 magnum]] pistol and that Sadiki had served as a lookout and drove the getaway truck during the robbery; neither White nor Rivers was cross-examined due to the defense attorney's refusal to participate in the trial.<ref name="prial"/> Shakur's aunt and lawyer, Evelyn Williams, was also cited for contempt after walking out of the courtroom after many of her attempted motions were denied.<ref name="p81"/> The trial was delayed for a few days after Shakur was diagnosed with [[pleurisy]].<ref>''The New York Times''.

===Attempted murder dismissal===
Shakur and four others (including Fred Hilton, Avon White, and Andrew Jackson) were indicted in the State Supreme Court in Bronx on December 31, 1973 on charges of attempting to shoot and kill two policemen<U+2014>Michael O'Reilly and Roy Polliana, who were wounded but had since returned to duty<U+2014>in a January 28, 1973, ambush in [[St. Albans, Queens]].<ref>''The New York Times''.

===Queens bank robbery trial===
In July 1973, after being indicted by a grand jury, Shakur pleaded not guilty in Federal Court in Brooklyn to an indictment related to an August 31, 1971 $7,700 robbery of the [[Bankers Trust|Bankers Trust Company]] bank in Queens.<ref name="qbank">''The New York Times''.

<!--The capitalization of the following quotation is correct-->
:"i have decided to act as co-counsel, and to make this opening statement, not because i have any illusions about my legal abilities, but, rather, because there are things that i must say to you. i have spent many days and nights behind bars thinking about this trial, this outrage. And in my own mind, only someone who has been so intimately a victim of this madness as i have can do justice to what i have to say."<ref name="rod63"/>
One bank employee testified that Shakur was one of the bank robbers, but three other bank employees (including two tellers) testified that they were uncertain.<ref name="qacquit"/> The prosecution showed surveillance photos of four of the six alleged robbers, contending that one of them was Shakur wearing a wig. Shakur was forcibly subdued and photographed by the FBI on the judge's order, after having refused to cooperate, believing that the FBI would use [[photo manipulation]]; a subsequent judge determined that the manners in which the photos were obtained violated Shakur's rights and ruled the new photos inadmissible.<ref name="p81"/> In her autobiography, Shakur recounts being beaten, choked, and kicked on the courtroom floor by five marshals, as Williams narrated the events to ensure they would appear on the court record.<ref name="Shakur, 1987, p. 161">Shakur, 1987, p. 161.</ref> Shortly after deliberation began, the jury asked to see all the photographic exhibits taken from the surveillance footage.<ref name="qacquit"/> The jury determined that a widely circulated FBI photo allegedly showing Shakur participating in the robbery was not her.<ref name="taylor">Taylor, Mark Lewis.

===Turnpike trial===
[[Image:Map of New Jersey highlighting Middlesex County.svg|thumb|right|150px|Shakur's murder trial for the Turnpike shootout took place in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]],  [[Middlesex County, New Jersey]].]]
For Shakur's trial related to the New Jersey Turnpike shootout, Superior Court Judge Leon Gerofsky ordered a [[change of venue]] in 1973 from [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex]] to [[Morris County, New Jersey]], saying "it was almost impossible to obtain a jury here {{sic|hide=y|comprised |of}} people willing to accept the responsibility of impartiality so that defendants will be protected from transitory passion and prejudice".<ref name="Hershberger">Hershberger, James.

The nine-week trial was widely publicized, and was even reported on by the [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union]] (TASS).<ref name="kirsta"/><ref name="b159"/>  On March 25, 1977, back in Middlesex County, Shakur was convicted as an [[accomplice]] in the [[Felony murder|murders]] of New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster and Zayd Shakur and possession of weapons, as well as of [[assault]] and [[attempted murder]] of Harper.<ref name="NYT_1977-03-26"/> During the trial, hundreds of civil rights campaigners demonstrated outside of the Middlesex County courthouse each day.<ref name="kirsta"/>

Following the 13-minute opening statement by Edward J. Barone, the first assistant Middlesex County prosecutor (directing the case for the state), William Kunstler (the chief of Shakur's defense staff) moved immediately for a mistrial, calling the eight-count grand jury indictment "adversary proceeding solely and exclusively under the control of the prosecutor", whom Kunstler accused of "improper prejudicial remarks"; Judge Appleby, noting the frequent defense interruptions which had characterized the previous days' jury selection, denied the motion.<ref name="wag"/> The prosecution contended that Shakur shot and killed her companion, Zayd Shakur, and "executed" Trooper Foerster with his own weapon.<ref name="wag"/>

The next day the jury listened to State Police radio tapes while being provided with a printed transcript, an arrangement which was the result of "hours of haggling" between the defense and prosecution.<ref name="wag2"/> The "climax" of the tape came when Trooper Ronald Foster, the State Police radio operator, shouted into his microphone "They just shot Harper! Be on the lookout for this car!" and "It is a Pontiac. It's got one tail light" after the wounded Harper entered into the administration building near the site of the shootout.<ref name="wag2"/> As the tapes were played, Shakur was seated "calmly and without apparent concern" wearing a yellow [[turban]] and brightly colored floor-length dress over a white turtleneck sweater.<ref name="wag2"/>

Shakur's attorneys had successfully asked a 10-judge panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] to order that sessions for her murder trial not be held on Fridays because of [[Black Muslims|Black Muslim Sabbath]], although the Appeals Court for the Third Circuit rejected her plea to move the murder trial to a federal court.<ref name="wag2"/><ref>Janson, Donald.

On February 23, Shakur's attorneys filed papers asking Judge Appleby to [[subpoena]] FBI Director [[Clarence M. Kelley|Clarence Kelley]], Senator [[Frank Church]] and other federal and New York law enforcement officials to testify about the Counter Intelligence Program, which they alleged was designed to harass and disrupt black activist organizations.<ref name="sul">Sullivan, Joseph F.

Shakur herself was called as a witness on March 15, the first witness called by the defense; she denied shooting either Harper or Foerster, and also denied handling a weapon during the incident. She was questioned by her own attorney, Stuart Ball, for under 40&nbsp;minutes, and then cross-examined by Barone for less than two hours (see the [[Assata Shakur#Witnesses|Witnesses section]] below).<ref name="sul2"/> Ball's questioning ended with the following exchange:
:"On that night of May 2[n]d, did you shoot, kill, execute or have anything to do with the death of Trooper Werner Foerster?"
:"No."

:"No."<ref name="sul2">Sullivan, Joseph F. (March 16, 1977). "[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F0071EFE385D167493C4A81788D85F438785F9 Mrs. Chesimard, on Stand, Denies Having Weapon in Turnpike Shooting]". ''The New York Times'', p. 57.</ref>
Under cross-examination, Shakur was unable to explain how three clips of ammunition and 16 live shells had gotten into her shoulder bag; she also admitted to knowing that Zayd Shakur carried a gun at times, and specifically to seeing a gun sticking out of Acoli's pocket while stopping for supper at a [[Howard Johnson's]] restaurant shortly before the shooting.<ref name="sul2"/> Shakur admitted to carrying an identification card with the name "Justine Henderson" in her billfold the night of the shootout, but denied using any of the aliases on the long list that Barone proceeded to read.<ref name="sul2"/>

Judge Appleby also threatened Kunstler with dismissal and contempt of court after he delivered an October 21, 1976 speech at nearby [[Rutgers University]] that in part discussed the upcoming trial,<ref>[[Martin Waldron|Waldron, Martin]]. (December 3, 1976). "Kunstler and the Courts in a Battle On Right to Discuss Pending Trial".

Tensions and dissention existed among the members of the defense team.  Evelyn Williams felt that she was a victim of male prejudice stating that <U+201C>for the second time in (her) legal career (she) became aware of the disdain with which men perceive women<U+201D>.  She expressed <U+201C>amazement and contempt<U+201D> for the actions of her fellow lawyers as she watched their <U+201C>infighting for center stage<U+201D> during the trial. Other members of the team were concerned that Williams was overly aggressive during her sole cross-examination to the point of passing her notes which read in part, <U+201C>You<U+2019>re antagonizing the jury<U+201D> and <U+201C>Shut up and sit down.<U+201D><ref>Williams, 1993, p. 158-163.</ref>

====Witnesses====
Sundiata Acoli, Assata Shakur, Trooper  Harper, and a New Jersey Turnpike driver who saw part of the incident were the only surviving witnesses.<ref name="williamsfacts">Williams, Evelyn A.

Shakur testified that Trooper Harper shot her after she raised her arms to comply with his demand, the second shot hitting her in the back as she was turning to avoid it, and that she fell onto the road for the duration of the gunfight before crawling back into the backseat of the Pontiac which Acoli drove {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} down the road and parked, and remained there until State Troopers dragged her onto the road.<ref name="sul3"/><ref name="williamsfacts"/>

Trooper Harper's three official reports state that after he stopped the Pontiac, he ordered Acoli to the back of the vehicle  for Trooper Foerster<U+2014>who had arrived on the scene<U+2014>to examine his [[driver's license]].<ref name="williamsfacts"/> The reports then state that after Acoli complied and as Harper was looking inside the vehicle to examine the [[vehicle registration|registration]], Trooper Foerster yelled and held up an ammunition clip, as Shakur simultaneously reached into her red [[Handbag|pocketbook]], pulled out a [[9 mm caliber|nine-millimeter weapon]] and fired at him.<ref name="williamsfacts"/> Trooper Harper's reports then state that he ran to the rear of his car and shot at Shakur who had exited the vehicle and was firing from a crouched position next to the vehicle.<ref name="williamsfacts"/> Under [[cross-examination]] at both Acoli and Shakur's trials, Trooper Harper admitted to having lied in these reports and in his [[Grand Jury]] testimony about Trooper Foerster yelling and showing him an ammunition clip, about seeing Shakur holding a pocketbook or a gun inside the vehicle, and about Shakur shooting at him from the car.<ref name="kirsta"/><ref name="taylor"/> Trooper Harper retracted his previous statements and said that he had never seen Shakur with a gun, and that she did not shoot him.<ref>James, Joy.

One prospective juror was dismissed for reading ''Target Blue'',<ref>Daley, Robert. 1973. ''Target Blue: An Insider's View of the N.Y.P.D.''. Delacorte Press. ISBN 978-0-440-08489-1.</ref> a book by Robert Daley, a former New York City Deputy Police Commander, which dealt in part with Shakur and had been left in the jury assembly room.<ref>''The New York Times''.

Shakur's attorneys sought a new trial on the grounds that one jury member, John McGovern, had violated the jury's [[sequestering|sequestration]] order.<ref>''The New York Times''. (April 20, 1977).

(September 5, 1977). "Trenton Topics; Byrne and Bateman Stepping Up Campaigns as the Summer Fades". ''The New York Times'', p. 35, column 2.</ref>

====Medical evidence====
A key element of Shakur's defense was [[forensic biology|medical testimony]] meant to demonstrate that she was shot with her hands up and that she would have been subsequently unable to fire a weapon. A [[neurologist]] testified that the [[median nerve]] in Shakur's right arm was severed by the second bullet, making her unable to pull a trigger.<ref name="hinds"/> Neurosurgeon Dr. Arthur Turner Davidson, Associate Professor of Surgery at [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]], testified that the wounds in her upper arms, armpit and chest, and severed median nerve that instantly paralyzed her right arm, would only have been caused if both arms were raised, and that to sustain such injuries while crouching and firing a weapon (as described in Trooper Harper's testimony) "would be anatomically impossible".<ref name="kirsta"/><ref name="wag4">Waggoner, Walter H. (March 17, 1977). "Neurosurgeon's Testimony Backs Mrs. Chesimard". ''The New York Times'', Section 2, p. 20, column 3.</ref>

Davidson based his testimony on an August 4, 1976 examination of Shakur and on [[X-ray]]s taken immediately after the shootout at Middlesex General Hospital.<ref name="wag4"/> Prosecutor Barone questioned whether Davidson was qualified to make such a judgment 39&nbsp;months after the injury; Barone proceeded to suggest (while a female Sheriff's attendant acted out his suggestion) that Shakur was struck in the right arm and collar bone and "then spun around by the impact of the bullet so an immediate second shot entered the fleshy part of her upper left arm" to which Davidson replied "Impossible."<ref name="wag4"/>
[[Image:Illu pectoral girdles.png|thumb|right|Shakur's broken [[clavicle]] was a key element of her defense, and the implications of her injury for the differing accounts of the shootout were points of contention.]]
Dr. David Spain, a [[pathologist]] from [[Brookdale Community College]], testified that her bullet scars as well as X-rays supported her claim that her arms were raised, and that there was "no conceivable way" the first bullet could have hit Shakur's [[clavicle]] if her arm was down.<ref>Sullivan, Joseph F. (March 18, 1977). "[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F1091EFC385D167493CAA81788D85F438785F9 Doctor Testifies On Bullet Scars in Chesimard Trial]".

ISBN 0-631-21007-5. p. 279.</ref>

Judge Appleby eventually cut off funds for any further expert defense testimony.<ref name="kirsta"/> Shakur, in her autobiography, and Williams, in ''Inadmissible Evidence'', both claim that it was difficult to find expert witnesses for the trial, not only because of the financial expense, but also because most forensic and ballistic specialists declined on the grounds of a [[conflict of interest]] when approached because they routinely performed such work for law enforcement officials.<ref>Perkins, 2000, pp. 80<U+2013>81.</ref>

====Other evidence====
[[Neutron activation analysis]] administered after the shootout showed no [[gun powder]] residue on Shakur's fingers; her [[fingerprint]]s were not found on any weapon at the scene, according to forensic analysis performed at the [[Trenton, New Jersey]] crime lab and the FBI crime labs in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name="howell">Howell, Ron. (June 7, 1998). "Revolutionary on Ice: Assata Shakur's Cuban Exile". ''Newsday''.</ref> According to tape recordings and police reports made several hours after the shoot-out, when Harper returned on foot to the administration building 200&nbsp;yards (183&nbsp;m) away, he did not report Foerster's presence at the scene; no one at headquarters knew of Foerster's involvement in the shoot-out until his body was discovered beside his patrol car, more than an hour later.<ref name="kirsta"/>

====Conviction and sentencing====
On March 24, the jurors listened for 45&nbsp;minutes to a rereading of testimony of the State Police chemist regarding the blood found at the scene, on the LeMans, and Shakur's clothing.<ref name="sul3"/> That night, the second night of jury deliberation, the jury asked Judge Appleby to repeat his instructions regarding the four assault charges 30&nbsp;minutes before retiring for the night, which lead to speculation that the jury had decided in Shakur's favor on the remaining charges, especially the two counts of murder.<ref name="sul3">Sullivan, Joseph E. (March 25, 1977). "[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10C11FB385D167493C7AB1788D85F438785F9 Chesimard Jury Asks Clarification of Assault Charges]". ''The New York Times'', p. 50.</ref> Appleby reiterated that the jury must consider separately the four assault charges (atrocious assault and battery, assault on a police officer acting in the line of duty, [[assault with a deadly weapon]], and assault with intent to kill), each of which carried a total maximum penalty of 33&nbsp;years in prison.<ref name="sul3"/> The other charges were: first-degree murder (of Foerster), second-degree murder (of Zayd Shakur), illegal possession of a weapon, and armed robbery (related to Foerster's service revolver).<ref name="NYT_1977-03-26"/> The jury also asked Appleby to repeat the definitions of "[[intent (law)|intent]]" and "[[reasonable doubt]]".<ref name="sul3"/>

Shakur was convicted on all eight counts: two murder charges, and six assault charges.<ref name="NYT_1977-03-26"/> The prosecution did not need to prove that Shakur fired the shots that killed either Trooper Foerster or Zayd Shakur: being an accomplice to murder carries an equivalent life sentence under New Jersey law.<ref name="kirsta">Kirsta, Alix. (May 29, 1999). "A black and white case <U+2013> Investigation <U+2013> Joanne Chesimard". ''The Times''.</ref> Upon hearing the verdict, Shakur said<U+2014>in a "barely audible voice"<U+2014>that she was "ashamed that I have even taken part in this trial" and that the jury was "racist" and had "convicted a woman with her hands up".<ref name="NYT_1977-03-26"/> Judge Appleby told the court attendants to "remove the prisoner" and Shakur replied: "the prisoner will walk away on her own feet".<ref name="NYT_1977-03-26"/> After Joseph W. Lewis, the jury foreman, read the verdict, Kunstler asked that the jury be removed before alleging that one juror had violated the sequestration order (see above).<ref name="NYT_1977-03-26"/>

At the post trial press conference Kunstler blamed the verdict on racism stating that <U+201C>the white element was there to destroy her.<U+201D>  When asked by a reporter that if that were the case why did it take the jury 24 hours to reach a verdict Kunstler replied, <U+201C>That was just a pretense.<U+201D> A few minutes later the prosecutor Barone disagreed with Kunstler<U+2019>s assessment saying the trial<U+2019>s outcome was decided <U+201C>completely on the facts.<U+201D><ref name="NYT_1977-03-26"/>

At Shakur's sentencing hearing on April 25, Appleby sentenced her to 26 to 33&nbsp;years in state prison (10 to 12 for the four counts of assault, 12 to 15 for robbery, 2 to 3 for armed robbery, plus 2 to 3 for aiding and abetting the murder of Foerster) which was to be served consecutively with her [[Mandatory sentencing|mandatory life sentence]]; however, Appleby dismissed the second-degree murder of Zayd Shakur, as the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] had recently narrowed the application of the law.<ref name="sentencing">Sullivan, Joseph F. (April 26, 1977). "[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00A1FFD3B5B167493C4AB178FD85F438785F9 Assault Charges Add 26 Years To Mrs. Chesimard's Life Term]". ''The New York Times'', p. 83, column 4. Retrieved on 2008-06-16.</ref> Appleby finally sentenced Shakur to 30&nbsp;days in the Middlesex County Workhouse for [[contempt of court]], concurrent with the other sentences, for refusing to rise when he entered the courtroom.<ref name="sentencing"/> To become eligible for [[parole]], Shakur would have had to serve a minimum of 25&nbsp;years, which would have included her four years in custody during the trials.<ref name="sentencing"/>

===Murder dismissal===
In October 1977, New York State Superior Court Justice John Starkey dismissed murder and robbery charges against Shakur related to the death of Richard Nelson during a December 28, 1972, hold-up of a Brooklyn social club, ruling that the state had [[Statute of limitations|delayed too long]] in bringing her to trial, saying "People have constitutional rights, and you can't shuffle them around."<ref name="seigel">Seigel, Max H. (October 26, 1977).

''The New York Times'', p. 25, column 5.</ref> The case was delayed in being brought to trial as a result of an agreement between the Governors of New York and New Jersey as to the priority of the various charges against Shakur.<ref name="seigel"/> Three other defendants were indicted in relation to the same holdup: Melvin Kearney, who died in 1976 from an eight-floor fall while trying to escape from the Brooklyn House of Detention, Twymon Myers, who was killed by police while a fugitive, and Andrew Jackson, the charges against whom were dismissed when two prosecution witnesses could not identify him in a lineup.<ref name="seigel"/>

===Attempted robbery dismissal===
On November 22, 1977, Shakur pleaded not guilty to an attempted armed robbery indictment stemming from the 1971 incident at the [[Statler Hilton Hotel]].<ref name="tribrob">''Chicago Tribune''. (November 24, 1977). "Black lib army 'chief' denies 1971 robbery". p. C23.</ref> Shakur was accused of attempting to rob a Michigan man staying at the hotel of $250 of cash and personal property.<ref name="tribrob"/> During the incident Shakur was shot in the stomach and subsequently arrested, booked, and released on bail.<ref name="tribrob"/> The prosecutor was C. Richard Gibbons.<ref name="tribrob"/> The charges were dismissed without trial.<ref>Shakur, 1987, p. xiv.</ref>

==Imprisonment==
