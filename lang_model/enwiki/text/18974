The term "Pok<U+00E9>mon", in addition to referring to the ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' franchise itself, also collectively refers to the 493 [[List of Pok<U+00E9>mon|fictional species]] that have made appearances in ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' media as of the recent release of the newest ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' role-playing games (RPGs) for the [[Nintendo DS]], [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond and Pearl (video games)|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']]. Like the words [[deer]] and [[sheep]], the singular and plural forms of the word "Pok<U+00E9>mon" do not differ, nor does each individual species name; in short, it is grammatically correct to say both "one Pok<U+00E9>mon" and "many Pok<U+00E9>mon". In November 2005, [[4Kids Entertainment]], which had managed the non-game related licensing of Pok<U+00E9>mon, announced that it had agreed not to renew the Pok<U+00E9>mon representation agreement. [[Pok<U+00E9>mon USA]] Inc., a subsidiary of Japan's Pok<U+00E9>mon Co., now oversees all Pok<U+00E9>mon licensing outside of Asia.<ref>"[http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=7615 Pokemon USA Moves Licensing In-House]", ''Gamasutra''.</ref>

==Collecting and playing==
The concept of the ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' universe, in both the video games and the general fictional world of ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'', stems from the hobby of [[insect collecting]], a popular pastime which ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' executive director Satoshi Tajiri-Oniwa had enjoyed as a child.<ref> "{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/pokemon6.fullinterview1.html |title=The Ultimate Game Freak: Interview with Satoshi Tajiri |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050314021722/http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/pokemon6.fullinterview1.html |archivedate=2005-03-14}}", ''TimeAsia'' ([[Waybacked]]).</ref> Players of the games are designated as [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Trainer]]s, and the two general goals (in most ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' games) for such Trainers are: to complete the [[Pok<U+00E9>dex]] by collecting all of the available Pok<U+00E9>mon species found in the fictional region where that game takes place; and to train a team of powerful Pok<U+00E9>mon from those they have caught to compete against teams owned by other Trainers, and eventually become the strongest Trainer, the Pok<U+00E9>mon Master. These themes of collecting, training, and battling are present in almost every version of the ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' franchise, including the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon video game series|video games]], the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon (anime)|anime]] and manga series, and the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Trading Card Game]].

In most incarnations of the fictional ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' universe, a Trainer that encounters a wild Pok<U+00E9>mon is able to capture that Pok<U+00E9>mon by throwing a specially designed, mass-producible tool called a [[Pok<U+00E9> Ball]] at it. If the Pok<U+00E9>mon is unable to escape the confines of the Pok<U+00E9> Ball, that Pok<U+00E9>mon is officially considered under the ownership of that Trainer. Afterward, it will obey whatever commands its new master issues to it from that point onward, unless the Trainer demonstrates enough of a lack of experience that the Pok<U+00E9>mon would rather act on its own accord. Trainers can send out any of their Pok<U+00E9>mon to wage non-lethal battles against other Pok<U+00E9>mon; if the opposing Pok<U+00E9>mon is wild, the Trainer can capture that Pok<U+00E9>mon with a Pok<U+00E9> Ball, increasing his or her collection of creatures. (Pok<U+00E9>mon already owned by other Trainers cannot be captured, except under special circumstances in certain games.) If a Pok<U+00E9>mon fully defeats an opponent in battle so that the opponent is knocked out (i.e., "faints"), the winning Pok<U+00E9>mon gains experience and may [[level up]]. When leveling up, the Pok<U+00E9>mon's statistics ("[[Pok<U+00E9>mon game mechanics|stats]]") of battling aptitude increase, including Attack, Speed, and so on. From time to time the Pok<U+00E9>mon may also learn new [[Pok<U+00E9>mon move|moves]], which are techniques used in battle. In addition, many species of Pok<U+00E9>mon possess the ability to undergo a form of [[metamorphosis]] and transform into a similar but stronger species of Pok<U+00E9>mon, a process called [[Pok<U+00E9>mon evolution|evolution]].

In the main series, each game's single-player mode requires the Trainer to raise a team of Pok<U+00E9>mon to defeat many [[non-player character]] (NPC) Trainers and their Pok<U+00E9>mon. Each game lays out a somewhat linear path through a specific region of the Pok<U+00E9>mon world for the Trainer to journey through, completing events and battling opponents along the way. Each game features eight especially powerful Trainers, referred to as Gym Leaders, that the Trainer must each defeat in order to progress. As a reward, the Trainer receives a Gym Badge, and once all eight badges are collected, that Trainer is eligible to challenge the region's Pok<U+00E9>mon League, where four immensely talented trainers (referred to collectively as the "Elite Four") challenge the Trainer to four Pok<U+00E9>mon battles in succession. If the trainer can overcome this gauntlet, he or she must then challenge the Regional Champion, the master Trainer who had previously defeated the Elite Four. Any Trainer who wins this last battle becomes the new champion and gains the title of Pok<U+00E9>mon Master.

===Generations===
<!--Please don't delete/rename this header as it is linked to/from a number of places.-->The original Pok<U+00E9>mon games were Japanese [[Console role-playing game|RPGs]] with an element of strategy, and were created by Satoshi Tajiri for the [[Game Boy]]. These role-playing games, and their sequels, remakes, and English language translations, are still considered the "main" Pok<U+00E9>mon games, and the games which most fans of the series are referring to when they use the term "Pok<U+00E9>mon games". All of the licensed Pok<U+00E9>mon properties overseen by [[The Pok<U+00E9>mon Company]] are divided roughly by generation. These generations are roughly [[chronological]] divisions by release; every several years, when an official sequel in the main RPG series is released that features new Pok<U+00E9>mon, characters, and gameplay concepts, that sequel is considered the start of a new generation of the franchise. The main games and their spin-offs, the anime, the manga, and the trading card game are all updated with the new Pok<U+00E9>mon properties each time a new generation begins. The franchise is in its fourth generation.[[Image:Bulbasaur pokemon red.png|thumb|right|A level 5 [[Bulbasaur]] involved in a battle with a level 5 [[Charmander]] in [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Red|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Red and Blue'']].<ref> MacDonald, Mark; Brokaw, Brian; Arnold; J. Douglas; Elies, Mark. Pok<U+00E9>mon Trainer's Guide. Sandwich Islands Publishing, 1999. ISBN 0-439-15404-9. (pg73)</ref>]]The Pok<U+00E9>mon franchise started off in its first generation with its initial release of [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Red and Blue#Pocket Monsters|''Pocket Monsters Aka'' and ''Midori'']] ("Red" and "Green", respectively) for the [[Game Boy]] in Japan. When these games proved extremely popular, an enhanced ''Ao'' ("Blue") version was released sometime after, and the ''Ao'' version was reprogrammed as [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Red and Blue|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Red'' and ''Blue'']] for international release. The games launched in the United States on September 30, 1998. The original ''Aka'' and ''Midori'' versions were never released outside of Japan.<ref>[http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gameboy/data/924467.html "Pok<U+00E9>mon Green Info on GameFAQs"] ''gamefaqs.com'' URL Accessed February 23, 2007</ref> Afterwards, a further enhanced remake titled ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition]]'' was released to partially take advantage of the color palette of the [[Game Boy Color]], as well as to feature more elements from the popular [[Pok<U+00E9>mon (anime)|Pok<U+00E9>mon anime]]. This first generation of games introduced the original 151 species of Pok<U+00E9>mon (in [[List of Pok<U+00E9>mon|National Pok<U+00E9>dex]] order, encompassing all Pok<U+00E9>mon from [[Bulbasaur]] to [[Mew (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Mew]]), as well as the basic game concepts of capturing, training, battling, and trading Pok<U+00E9>mon with both computer and human players. These versions of the games take place within the fictional [[Kanto (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Kanto]] [[Pok<U+00E9>mon regions|region]], though the name "Kanto" was not used until the second generation. The second generation of Pok<U+00E9>mon began in 2000 with the release of [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Gold and Silver|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']] for [[Game Boy Color]]. Like the previous generation, an enhanced remake titled ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Crystal]]'' was later released. The second generation introduced 100 new species of Pok<U+00E9>mon (starting with [[Chikorita]] and ending with [[Celebi]]), for a total of 251 Pok<U+00E9>mon to collect, train, and battle. The Pok<U+00E9>mon mini was a [[handheld game console]] released in December 2001 in Japan and then later in 2002 in Europe and North America. ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' entered its third generation with the 2003 release of [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']] for [[Game Boy Advance]] and continued with the Game Boy Advance remakes of ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Red and Blue'', [[Pok<U+00E9>mon FireRed and LeafGreen|''Pok<U+00E9>mon FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']], and an enhanced remake of ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby and Sapphire'' titled '<U+2018>[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Emerald]]<U+2019>'. The third generation introduced 135 new Pok<U+00E9>mon (starting with [[Treecko]] and ending with [[Deoxys]]) for a total of 386 species. However, this generation also garnered some criticism for leaving out several gameplay features, including the day-and-night system introduced in the previous generation, and it was also the first installment that encouraged the player to collect merely a selected assortment of the total number of Pok<U+00E9>mon rather than every existing species (202 out of 386 species are catchable in the ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' versions). In 2006, Japan began the fourth generation of the franchise with the release of [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond and Pearl (video games)|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] for Nintendo DS. The fourth generation introduces another 107 new species of Pok<U+00E9>mon (starting with [[Turtwig]] and ending with [[Arceus]]), bringing the total of Pok<U+00E9>mon species to 493.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.ds.ign.com/articles/778/778464p1.html |title=The Countdown to Diamond and Pearl, Part 4|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=Lucas M.

New gameplay concepts include a restructured [[Pok<U+00E9>mon moves|move]]-classification system, online multiplayer trading and battling via [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], the return (and expansion) of the second generation's day-and-night system, the expansion of the third generation's Pok<U+00E9>mon Contests into "Super Contests", and the new region of [[Sinnoh]], which has an underground component for multiplayer gameplay in addition to the main overworld. ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Platinum]]'' has also been confirmed, the enhanced remake of Diamond and Pearl, much like Pok<U+00E9>mon Yellow, Crystal, and Emerald, and it has new features. Spin-off titles in the fourth generation include the ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Stadium'' follow-up ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Battle Revolution]]'' for [[Wii]], which has Wi-Fi connectivity as well.<ref>"[http://www.cubed3.com/news/5349 Cubed3 Pok<U+00E9>mon Battle Revolution Confirmed for Wii]" and soon Pok<U+00E9>mon Mistery Dungeon 2: Darkness Exploration Team, and Time Exploration Team ''Cubed3.com''.

====Starter Pok<U+00E9>mon====
{{main|Pok<U+00E9>mon game mechanics#Starter Pok<U+00E9>mon|l1=Starter Pok<U+00E9>mon}}
One of the consistent aspects of the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon video games|''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' games]] &mdash; spanning from [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Red and Blue|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Red'' and ''Blue'']] on the [[Game Boy line|Nintendo Game Boy]] to the [[Nintendo DS]] game, [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond and Pearl (video games)|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] &mdash; is the choice of one of three different Pok<U+00E9>mon at the start of the player's adventures; these three are often labeled "starter Pok<U+00E9>mon". Players can choose a [[Pok<U+00E9>mon type#Grass-type|Grass-type]], a [[Pok<U+00E9>mon type#Fire-type|Fire-type]], or a [[Pok<U+00E9>mon type#Water-type|Water-type]].<ref name=spy> [http://uk.gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/pokemon-ruby-version/498107p1.html ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby'' review (page 1)] ''Gamespy.com''. URL Accessed May 30, 2006.</ref> For example, in ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Red'' and ''Blue'' (and their respective reworks, ''Pok<U+00E9>mon FireRed'' and ''Pok<U+00E9>mon LeafGreen''), the player has the choice of starting with [[Bulbasaur]], [[Charmander]], or [[Squirtle]]. The exception to this rule is ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Yellow]]'' (a remake of the original games that follows the story of the ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon (anime)|Pok<U+00E9>mon anime]]''), where players are given a [[Pikachu]], an [[Pok<U+00E9>mon type#Electric-type|Electric-type]] mouse Pok<U+00E9>mon, famous for being the mascot of the Pok<U+00E9>mon media franchise; in this game, however, the three starter Pok<U+00E9>mon from ''Red'' and ''Blue'' can be obtained during the quest by a single player, something that is not possible in any other installment of the franchise.<ref>[http://uk.gameboy.ign.com/articles/162/162045p1.html ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Yellow'' Critical Review] ''Ign.com''. URL accessed on March 27, 2006.</ref> Another consistent aspect is that the player's rival will always choose as his or her starter Pok<U+00E9>mon the one that has a type advantage over the player's Pok<U+00E9>mon. For instance, if the player picks a Grass-type Pok<U+00E9>mon, the rival will always pick the fire-type starter. Of course, the exception to this is again ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Yellow'', in which the rival picks an [[Eevee]], but whether this Eevee evolves into [[Jolteon]], [[Vaporeon]], or [[Flareon]] is decided by when the player wins and loses to the rival through the journey.

====Pok<U+00E9>dex====
{{Main|Pok<U+00E9>dex}}
The [[Pok<U+00E9>dex]] is a fictional electronic device featured in the ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' [[video game]] and [[Pok<U+00E9>mon (anime)|anime]] series. In the games, whenever a Pok<U+00E9>mon is first captured, its data will be added to a player's Pok<U+00E9>dex, but in the anime or [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Adventures|manga]], the Pok<U+00E9>dex is a comprehensive electronic reference encyclopedia, usually referred to in order to deliver [[Exposition (plot device)|exposition]]. "[[Pok<U+00E9>dex]]" is also used to refer to a list of Pok<U+00E9>mon, usually a list of Pok<U+00E9>mon by number. In the video games, a [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Trainer]] is issued a blank device at the start of their journey. A trainer must then attempt to fill the Pok<U+00E9>dex by encountering and at least briefly obtaining each of the different species of Pok<U+00E9>mon. A player will receive the name and image of a Pok<U+00E9>mon after encountering one that was not previously in the Pok<U+00E9>dex, typically after battling said Pok<U+00E9>mon either in the wild or in a trainer battle (with the exceptions of link battles and tournament battles, such as in the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Emerald#Battle Frontier|Battle Frontier]]). In ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Red'' and ''Blue'', some Pok<U+00E9>mon's data is added to the Pok<U+00E9>dex simply by viewing the Pok<U+00E9>mon, such as in the zoo outside of the Safari Zone. Also, certain NPC characters may add to the Pok<U+00E9>dex by explaining what a Pok<U+00E9>mon looks like during conversation. More detailed information is available after the player obtains a member of the species, either through capturing the Pok<U+00E9>mon in the wild, evolving a previously captured Pok<U+00E9>mon, hatching a Pok<U+00E9>mon egg (from the second generation onwards), or through a trade with another trainer (either an NPC or another player). This information includes height, weight, species type, and a short description of the Pok<U+00E9>mon. Later versions of the Pok<U+00E9>dex have more detailed information, like the size of a certain Pok<U+00E9>mon compared to the player character, or Pok<U+00E9>mon being sorted by their habitat (so far, the latter feature is only in the ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen''  versions).The most current forms of Pok<U+00E9>dex are capable of containing information on all Pok<U+00E9>mon currently known. The [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]] games, ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Colosseum]]'' and ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon XD: Gale of Darkness]]'', have a Pok<U+00E9>mon Digital Assistant (P{{Unicode|<U+2605>}}DA) which is similar to the Pok<U+00E9>dex, but also tells what types are effective against a Pok<U+00E9>mon and gives a description of its abilities.<ref>Official Pok<U+00E9>mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p. 30-31</ref>

==In other media==
===Anime series===

[[Image:Pok<U+00E9>mon episode 1 screenshot.png|thumb|250px|left|Ash Ketchum and Pikachu together in the pilot episode, [[Pok<U+00E9>mon, I Choose You!]] ]]The ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' anime [[Television program|series]] and [[film]]s are a meta-series of adventures separate from the [[canon (fiction)|canon]] that most of the ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' video games follow (with the exception of ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Yellow]]'', a game based on the anime storyline). The anime follows the quest of the main character, [[Ash Ketchum]]<ref name=ash> [http://www.psypokes.com/anime/index.php ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' anime overview] ''Psypokes.com''.

The original series, titled ''Pocket Monsters'', or simply ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' in western countries (often referred to as ''Pok<U+00E9>mon: Gotta Catch 'Em All'' to distinguish it from the later series), begins with Ash's first day as a Pok<U+00E9>mon trainer. His first (and signature) Pok<U+00E9>mon is a [[Pikachu]], differing from the games, where only [[Bulbasaur]], [[Charmander]], or [[Squirtle]] could be chosen.<ref> ''Pok<U+00E9>mon 10th Anniversary, Vol. 1 - Pikachu'', Viz Video., June 6, 2006. {{ASIN|B000F4PDE4}}.</ref>  The series follows the storyline of the original games, [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Red and Blue|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Red'' and ''Blue'']], in the region of [[Kanto (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Kanto]]. Accompanying Ash on his journeys are [[Brock (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Brock]], the [[List of Kanto locations#Pewter City|Pewter City]] Gym Leader, and [[Misty (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Misty]], the youngest of the Gym Leader sisters from [[List of Kanto locations#Cerulean City|Cerulean City]]. ''Pok<U+00E9>mon: Adventures in the Orange Islands'' follows Ash's adventures in the Orange Islands, a place unique to the anime, and replaces Brock with [[Tracey Sketchit]], an artist and "Pok<U+00E9>mon watcher". The next series, based on the second generation of games, include ''Pok<U+00E9>mon: Johto Journeys'', ''Pok<U+00E9>mon: Johto League Champions'', and ''Pok<U+00E9>mon: Master Quest'', following the original trio of Ash, Brock, and Misty in the western [[Johto]] region. The saga continues in ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon: Advanced Battle]]'', based on the third generation games. Ash and company travel to [[Hoenn]], a southern region in the Pok<U+00E9>mon World. Ash takes on the role of a teacher and mentor for a novice Pok<U+00E9>mon trainer named [[May (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|May]]. Her brother [[Max (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Max]] accompanies them, and though he isn't a trainer, he knows large amounts of handy information. Brock (from the original series) soon catches up with Ash, but Misty has returned to Cerulean City to tend to her duties as a gym leader. (Misty, along with other recurring characters, appears in the spin-off series ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Chronicles]]''.) The Advanced Battle series concludes with the ''Battle Frontier'' saga, based on the ''Emerald'' version and including aspects of ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen''. The most recent series is the ''Diamond and Pearl'' series, with Max leaving to pick his starter Pok<U+00E9>mon, and May going to the Grand Festival in Johto. Ash, Brock, and a new companion named [[Dawn (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Dawn]] travel through the region of [[Sinnoh]]. In addition to the TV series, eleven [[Pok<U+00E9>mon (anime)#Pok<U+00E9>mon films|Pok<U+00E9>mon films]] have been made, with a twelfth to be released in Japan in July 2008. Collective bonuses, such as promotional trading cards, have been available with some of the films.

These releases were commonplace until late 2001.  On March 27, 2007, a tenth anniversary CD was released containing 18 tracks from the English dub; this was the first English-language release in over five years. Soundtracks of the Pok<U+00E9>mon feature films have been released in Japan each year in conjunction with the theatrical releases.

There are various ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' [[manga]] series, four of which were released in [[English language|English]] by [[VIZ Media|Viz Communications]], and seven of them released in English by [[Chuang Yi]].

On December 16, 1997, more than 635 Japanese children were admitted to hospitals with [[epileptic seizure]]s. It was determined that the seizures were caused by watching an episode of Pok<U+00E9>mon, "''[[Banned episodes of Pok<U+00E9>mon#Denn<U+014D> Senshi Porygon|Denn<U+014D> Senshi Porygon]]''", (most commonly translated "Electric Soldier Porygon", season 1, episode 38); as a result, this episode has not been aired since.

===Monster in My Pocket===
In March 2000, Morrison Entertainment Group, a small toy developer based at [[Manhattan Beach, California]], sued Nintendo over claims that Pok<U+00E9>mon infringed on its own "[[Monster in My Pocket]]" characters. A judge ruled that there was no infringement, so Morrison appealed the ruling in November 2001.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bronstad|first=Amanda|title=Toy Firm Will Appeal 'Pocket Monster' Suit|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m5072/is_46_23/ai_80165415|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071015132351/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m5072/is_46_23/ai_80165415|archivedate=2007-10-15|work=Los Angeles Business Journal|publisher=FindArticles.com|date=2001-11-12|accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref>

==Cultural influence==
[[Image:ana.b747.pokemon.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|200|[[All Nippon Airways]] [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-400]] in Pok<U+00E9>mon livery.]]''Pok<U+00E9>mon'', being a popular franchise, has undoubtedly left its mark on [[pop-culture]]. The ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' characters themselves have become pop-culture icons; examples include two different [[Pikachu]] balloons in the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]], a [[:Image:ana.b747.pokemon.arp.750pix.jpg|Pok<U+00E9>mon-styled]] [[Boeing 747-400]], thousands of merchandise items, and a [[Pok<U+00E9>park|theme park]] in [[Nagoya, Aichi|Nagoya, Japan]] in 2005 and [[Taipei]] in 2006. Pok<U+00E9>mon also appeared on the cover of the U.S. magazine ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in 1999. The Comedy Central show ''[[Drawn Together]]'' has a character named [[Ling-Ling]] which is a direct parody of Pikachu.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://trsrockin.com/ripoffs.html|title=Pokemon Rip-offs|accessdate=2008-06-29}}</ref> Several other shows such as ''[[ReBoot]]'', ''[[Thirty Minutes over Tokyo|The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Chinpokomon|South Park]]'', ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy]]'', and ''[[All Grown Up!]]'' have made references and spoofs of ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'', among other series. Pok<U+00E9>mon was also featured on [[VH1]]'s ''[[I Love the '90s: Part Deux]]''. A live action show called ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Live!]]'' toured the United States in late 2000. It was based on the popular [[Pok<U+00E9>mon (anime)|Pok<U+00E9>mon anime]], but had some continuity errors relating to it.


In November 2001, Nintendo opened a store called the Pok<U+00E9>mon Center in New York, in New York's [[Rockefeller Center]],<ref>http://www.auctionbytes.com/cab/abn/y01/m11/i19/s03 Opening Date of Store</ref> modeled after the two other Pok<U+00E9>mon Center stores in [[Tokyo]] and [[Osaka]], fictional buildings where Trainers take their Pok<U+00E9>mon to be healed.<ref>http://www.pokezam.com/pokemon/pokecenterny/ Information on the Store</ref> The store sold Pok<U+00E9>mon merchandise on a total of two floors, with items ranging from collectible shirts to stuffed Pok<U+00E9>mon [[plushies]].<ref>http://www.bigapplevisitorscenter.com/kids.htm Tour Site Page</ref> The store also featured a ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Distributing Machine'' in which players would place their game to receive an egg of a Pok<U+00E9>mon that is being given out at that time. The store also had tables that were open for players of the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Card Game]] to duel each other or an employee. The store was closed and replaced by the [[Nintendo World Store]] on May 14, 2005.<ref>http://ml.wisdomdigital.com/listingsinfo.cfm?id=62&table=Shopping&lid=7&cat=19 Manhattan Living Page On Store</ref>
