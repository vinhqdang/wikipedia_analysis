'''Interstate 296''' ('''I-296''') is a part of the [[Interstate Highway System]] in the US state of [[Michigan]]. It is a [[Michigan State Trunkline Highway System|state trunkline highway]] that runs for {{convert|3.43|mi|km|2}}  entirely within the [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] area. Its termini are [[Interstate 96|I-96]] on the north side of Grand Rapids in [[Walker, Michigan|Walker]] and [[Interstate 196|I-196]] near downtown Grand Rapids. For most of its length, the Interstate is [[concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with [[U.S. Route 131|U.S. Highway 131]] (US&nbsp;131), which continues as a freeway built to [[Interstate Highway standards]] north and south of the shorter I-296. The highway was first proposed in the late 1950s and opened in December 1962, but the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] (MDOT) has since eliminated all signage for I-296 and removed the designation from their official state map. The designation is therefore [[unsigned highway|unsigned]], but still listed on the Interstate Highway System route log maintained by the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA).

==Route description==
I-296 begins at the I-196 interchange west of the [[Grand River (Michigan)|Grand River]] and downtown Grand Rapids. For a short distance, the three northbound lanes are on the left and the three southbound lanes are on the right, contrary to the normal traffic arrangement in the US. This anomaly is reversed north of the ramps for I-196 as the southbound lanes go over the northbound lanes. Running parallel to the Grand River on the west bank, the freeway designation begins across the river from the 6th Street Bridge Park and [[Belknap Hill]] north of the [[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum]] and the [[DeVos Place Convention Center]]. The west side of the freeway faces residential neighborhoods and the east side borders commercial businesses and the river.<ref name="MDOT13"/><ref name="googleGR"/> South of the Ann Street interchange, the highway crosses a line of the [[Grand Rapids Eastern Railroad]].<ref name=PRFA/> After crossing both the railroad and Ann Street, the highway widens to allow for a grassy [[Central reservation|median]]. The freeway leaves Grand Rapids and enters Walker north of Ann Street.<ref name="MDOT13">{{cite map |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |title= State Transportation Map |year= 2013 |scale= 1&nbsp;in:3.5&nbsp;mi&nbsp;/ 1&nbsp;cm:2&nbsp;km |cartography= MDOT |inset= Grand Rapids }}</ref><ref name="googleGR">{{google maps |url= //maps.google.com/maps?saddr=US-131+N&daddr=Unknown+road&hl=en&sll=42.974935,-85.679154&sspn=0.015134,0.01457&geocode=FWC4jwIdkqfk-g%3BFXJikAId6Yvk-g&oq=Walker&mra=ls&t=h&z=14 |title= Overview Map of Unsigned I-296 |accessdate= December 22, 2009}}</ref>

Approaching I-96 from the south, the freeway passes east of the [[DeltaPlex Arena]], and it median widens further across the river from Comstock Riverside Park in Walker. An extra lane is added on the left, widening the freeway to four lanes. Unsigned I-296 occupies the left two lanes that form the left exit for I-96 from US&nbsp;131. At the split between I-296 and US&nbsp;131, I-296 curves northwest, and US&nbsp;131 curves northeast to follow a bend in the Grand River.<ref name="MDOT13"/><ref name="googleGR"/> Once I-296 diverges from US&nbsp;131, the highway crosses a rail line owned by [[CSX Transportation]] and passes over West River Drive.<ref name=PRFA/> To the northwest of these crossings, exits emerge on the right for eastbound I-96 and the left for northbound M-37 (Alpine Avenue). Past these exits, I-296 merges into westbound I-96 and terminates. Southbound unsigned I-296 begins where the ramps to US&nbsp;131 southbound split from eastbound I-96 at the Alpine Avenue overpass, merging with southbound US&nbsp;131 north of Ann Street.<ref name="MDOT13"/><ref name="googleGR"/>

==History==
[[File:Grand Rapids, Michigan 1955 Yellow Book.jpg|right|thumb| Planning map for the Grand Rapids area freeways from 1955|alt=Map]]
The development of a freeway along the modern-day I-296/US&nbsp;131 corridor was proposed in the 1950s. The 1955 ''[[General Location of National System of Interstate Highways]]'', an early platform for what would become the Interstate Highway System,  contained an inset of the proposed freeways in and around the Grand Rapids area including a north<U+2013>south freeway near the downtown area.<ref name="YBGR">{{cite map |url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Grand_Rapids,_Michigan_1955_Yellow_Book.jpg|title= General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955 |map=Grand Rapids |page= 43 |scale= Scale not given |cartography= BPR |publisher= Bureau of Public Roads |month= September |year= 1955 |oclc= 4165975}}</ref> Designated as part of the [[Interstate Highway System]] in 1957, I-296's construction was funded by the federal government.<ref name=FHWA>{{cite web |first= Tony |last= DeSimone |date= October 31, 2002 |url= http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/reports/routefinder/table2.htm |title=Table 2: Auxiliary Routes of the Dwight D.

The US&nbsp;131 freeway was officially opened at 10 a.m. on December 17, 1962, between Pearl Street and (at the time) the I-196/[[U.S. Route 16 in Michigan|US&nbsp;16]] freeway north of downtown. This freeway section encompassed all of I-296, which would connect I-196 north of town with I-96 downtown.<ref name=296opening/> (The I-96 and I-196 designations were later flipped west of Grand Rapids.<ref name=numbers>{{cite news |work= [[Holland Sentinel|Holland Evening Sentinel]] |title= New Numbers Seen for Road |page= 4 |date=October 23, 1963 |oclc= 13440201}}</ref>) M-37 was relocated in Grand Rapids to utilize I-96 around the northeast side of town instead of I-296/US&nbsp;131 in 1969.<ref name="MDSH69GR">{{cite map |publisher= [[Michigan Department of State Highways]] |title=Official Highway Map |year=1969 |cartography= [[H.M.

At the end of the 1970s, MDOT took part in a FHWA-backed initiative called the Positive Guidance Demonstration Project, and the two agencies audited signage practices in the vicinity of the I-96/M-37 and I-296/US&nbsp;131 interchange in Walker. MDOT determined that usage of the I-296 designation was "a potential source of confusion for motorists."<ref name=memo>{{cite conference |last= Conner |first= Robert E. |date= April 11, 1979 |title= Removing I-296 Signs in Grand Rapids |publisher= Federal Highway Administration }}</ref> FHWA agreed with the department's proposal to eliminate all signage and public map references to the designation in April 1979.<ref name=memo/> MDOT then petitioned the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO) on June 22, 1979, for their permission to make the change, saying "it is felt that the I-296 designation serves no useful purpose other than to designate an Interstate routing."<ref>{{cite conference |last= Woodford |first= John P. |date= June 22, 1979 |title= Request for Official AASHTO Approval to Remove I-296  Route Designation  from All References While Retaining the Route as Part of the Interstate System |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation}}</ref> On October 24 that year, MDOT also requested formal permission from the FHWA to remove all signage and map references to I-296. The FHWA granted permission on December 3, 1979, on the condition that MDOT would continue to use the designation on official documents. The approval explicitly retained the highway in the Interstate system for funding and other purposes.<ref name=letter>{{cite conference |last= Merchant |first= David A. |date= December 3, 1979 |title= Removal of I-296 Designation, Grand Rapids |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |publisher= [[Federal Highway Administration]] }}</ref> The last state map to show the I-296 designation was published in 1979, as the 1980 map lacks any reference to the designation.<ref name="MDSHT79GR">{{cite map |publisher= [[Michigan Department of State Highways and Transportation]] |title=Official Transportation Map |year= 1979 |edition=1978<U+2013>79 |scale= 1&nbsp;in:3&nbsp;mi |cartography= MDSHT |inset=Grand Rapids}}</ref><ref name="MDOT80GR">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |title=Official Transportation Map |year= 1980 |edition= 1980-81 |scale= 1&nbsp;in:3&nbsp;mi |cartography= MDOT |inset=Grand Rapids}}</ref> Other maps, like the one published by the Kent County Road Commission, occasionally show I-296.<ref name=KCRC08>{{cite map |publisher= Kent County Road Commission |year=2008 |title= Official Road Map |cartography= REGIS Agency |scale= 1&nbsp;in:1.5&nbsp;mi |section=12, T7N R12W}}</ref>
