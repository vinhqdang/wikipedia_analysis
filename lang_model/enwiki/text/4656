The '''Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway''' was a major part of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] system, extending the PRR west from [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] via [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] to [[Chicago, Illinois]]. It included the current [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]]-owned [[Fort Wayne Line]] east of [[Crestline, Ohio]] to Pittsburgh, and the [[Fort Wayne Secondary]], owned by [[CSX Transportation|CSX]], from Crestline west to Tolleston in [[Gary, Indiana]]. CSX leased its entire portion in 2004 to the [[Chicago, Fort Wayne and Eastern Railroad]] (CFE). The remaining portion of the line from Tolleston into Chicago is now part of the Norfolk Southern's Chicago District, with a small portion of the original PFW&C trackage abandoned in favor of the parallel lines of former competitors which are now part of the modern NS system.

==History==
The '''Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad''' was chartered in [[Ohio]] on February 24 and in [[Pennsylvania]] on April 11, 1848 to build from [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania|Allegheny City]] (annexed by [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] in 1907) west to [[Crestline, Ohio]] on the [[Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad]]. It was organized on June 15, and construction began on July 4, 1849. The first section, from Allegheny City west to [[New Brighton, Pennsylvania|New Brighton]], opened July 30, 1851. Extensions opened to [[Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania|Clarks Summit]] on October 22 and [[Enon Valley, Pennsylvania|Enon Valley]] November 19. On November 27, 1851 a section between [[Salem, Ohio|Salem]] and [[Alliance, Ohio]] was completed, not yet connected to the rest. On December 8, the east section was extended west to [[East Palestine, Ohio]], with a [[stagecoach]] transfer provided for through travel. Further sections opened  January 3, 1852 west to [[Columbiana, Ohio|Columbiana]], and on January 6 the gap between Columbiana and Salem was filled. In conjunction with the [[Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad]], connecting at Alliance, a through line was provided between [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] and Pittsburgh. On March 11, 1852, an extension west to [[Massillon, Ohio|Massillon]] was opened with an excursion. On August 10, 1852 a further extension from Massillon west to [[Wooster, Ohio|Wooster]] opened. The line west to [[Mansfield, Ohio|Mansfield]] was finished April 8, 1853, and the full line to [[Crestline, Ohio|Crestline]] opened April 11. With this it formed part of a through line to [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] via the [[Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad]].

Work began on August 16, 1854 on the [[Fort Wayne Railroad Bridge]] over the [[Allegheny River]] to extend the O&P into [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] to connect with the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. The bridge opened September 22, 1857, with a temporary station at [[Penn Street (Pittsburgh)|Penn Street]] and [[Tenth Street (Pittsburgh)|Tenth Street]].

The '''Ohio and Indiana Railroad''' was chartered in [[Ohio]] on March 26, 1850 and in [[Indiana]] on January 15, 1851, to extend the line west to [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]. It was organized July 4, 1850 and work began in February 1852. Some of the capital was gained from a merger with the '''Great Western Railroad''' of Ohio in 1851. On August 26, 1853 the line opened from [[Crestline, Ohio|Crestline]] west to [[Bucyrus, Ohio|Bucyrus]], and a continuation west to [[Forest, Ohio|Forest]] opened in early January 1854. On June 10 the line opened west to [[Delphos, Ohio|Delphos]], and on October 31 the full line to Fort Wayne was completed, opening the next day.

The '''Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad''' was chartered in [[Indiana]] on May 11, 1852 and organized September 14, 1852 as a further extension west to [[Chicago]]. It was chartered February 5, 1853 in [[Illinois]]. The first section opened in February 1856 from Fort Wayne to [[Columbia City (IN)|Columbia City]].

On July 26, 1856 the '''Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Rail Road''' was formed as a consolidation of the Fort Wayne and Chicago, Ohio and Indiana, and Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroads. Extensions opened west to [[Warsaw, Indiana|Warsaw]] September 28, [[Plymouth, Indiana|Plymouth]] November 10, [[Englewood, Illinois]] (south of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]) on November 29, 1858, and Van Buren Street in Chicago on December 25, 1858. On January 1, 1859 trains started running to Chicago, with a terminal at the future location of [[Union Station (Chicago)|Union Station]]. The part west of Plymouth was built with rails removed from the [[New Portage Railroad]].

From the early days, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] (PRR) had been involved with the project, supplying funds. Once the [[Fort Wayne Railroad Bridge]] at [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] was finished in 1857, trains began to run through from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]. In 1858 the PFW&C began using the first [[Union Station (Pittsburgh)|Union Station]] in Pittsburgh, shared with the PRR.

On July 1, 1859 the PFW&C defaulted on its debts, and was sold at [[foreclosure]] on October 24, 1861. It was reorganized as the '''Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway''' February 26, 1862.

On July 1, 1865 the PFW&C leased the [[New Castle and Beaver Valley Railroad]], giving it a branch from [[Homewood, Pennsylvania]] north to [[New Castle, Pennsylvania|New Castle]]. The [[Lawrence Railroad]], branching west from [[Lawrence Junction]] on the NC&BV to [[Youngstown, Ohio]], was leased on June 27, 1869. On June 1, 1887 the Lawrence Railroad became part of the [[Youngstown, Lawrence and Pittsburgh Railroad]], which on August 1 merged into the PRR's [[Pittsburgh, Youngstown and Ashtabula Railroad]], and on January 9, 1906 that merged with the New Castle and Beaver Valley to form the [[Pittsburgh, Youngstown and Ashtabula Railway]], still leased to the PRR.

The PFW&C bought the [[Cleveland, Zanesville and Cincinnati Railroad]] by [[deed]] on July 1, 1865, making it its Akron Branch. The line ran from [[Hudson, Ohio]] on the [[Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad]] south through [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], crossing the PFW&C at [[Orrville, Ohio|Orrville]] and continuing to [[Millersburg, Ohio|Millersburg]]. In 1868 a short 3.5 mile (5.5&nbsp;km) extension to the south was built, and on November 4, 1869 the PFW&C sold the line to the [[Pittsburgh, Mt. Vernon, Columbus and London Railroad]]. That company later became part of the PRR's [[Cleveland, Akron and Cincinnati Railway]].

On May 22, 1869 the PFW&C leased the [[Massillon and Cleveland Railroad]], giving it a short branch from [[Massillon, Ohio|Massillon]] north to the Akron Branch at [[Clinton, Ohio|Clinton]].

On July 1, 1869 the PRR leased the PFW&C and began operating it directly, but on April 1, 1871 the PFW&C was transferred to the newly-formed [[Pennsylvania Company]]. On December 1, 1871 the Pennsylvania Company leased the [[Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad]]. Since January 25, 1860 the C&P had been operated jointly by itself and by the PFW&C, providing a branch of the PFW&C from [[Rochester, Pennsylvania]] west and north, crossing the PFW&C at [[Alliance, Ohio]] and continuing to [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]].

Operation was transferred back to the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] from the [[Pennsylvania Company]] on January 1, 1918.

On February 1, 1968 the PRR was merged into [[Penn Central]]. The PFW&C stayed separate, filing for [[bankruptcy]] on July 14, 1973 over three years after Penn Central's 1970 bankruptcy. On April 1, 1976 the PFW&C became part of [[Conrail]]. Conrail downgraded the line, preferring other parallel lines. On June 2, 1994 the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] bought 18 miles (29&nbsp;km) from [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]] to [[Valparaiso, Indiana|Valparaiso]], which had been out of service since 1991, for $1.4 million. They soon bought 61 more miles (98&nbsp;km), from Valparaiso east to [[Warsaw, Indiana|Warsaw]], and acquired [[trackage rights]] east to [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]].

With the August 22, 1998 breakup of Conrail, the line was split at [[Crestline, Ohio]]. West of Crestline, including the section that had been owned by Norfolk Southern since 1994, went to [[CSX Transportation]], along with the intersecting [[Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway]] (better known as the '''Big Four''', a part of the [[New York Central Railroad]] system until 1968). Tracks east of Crestline went to Norfolk Southern, which also obtained [[trackage rights]] west of that Ohio city.

At the western end of the route, the original PFW&C line has been abandoned from Buffington (an area of far northwestern [[Gary, Indiana]], abutting [[East Chicago, Indiana|East Chicago]]) northwest for a little over four miles to [[Whiting, Indiana]]; at both of these locations there are connections to the parallel tracks of the old [[Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway]] ([[New York Central Railroad]]). Northwest of Whiting, the LS&MS itself disappears, and the present-day line goes back to using the old PFW&C tracks, which run the rest of the way into [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], carrying both Norfolk Southern freight trains and several [[Amtrak]] passenger services.

On August 1, 2004 the [[Chicago Fort Wayne and Eastern Railroad]], a new [[Short-line railroad|short line]] owned by [[RailAmerica]], leased the western part of the line, from [[Crestline, Ohio]] west to [[Gary, Indiana|the Gary, Indiana neighborhood of Tolleston]], from CSX. It also obtained [[overhead trackage rights]] along the formerly out-of-service line from Tolleston, at the junction with the old [[Michigan Central Railroad]] (now CSX), northwest to Clarke Junction (also in Gary, just north of the [[Gary-Chicago International Airport]]), and then west along the former [[Baltimore and Ohio Chicago Terminal Railroad]] (now CSX) to [[Blue Island, Illinois]]. [[Norfolk Southern]] continues to own the line east of Crestline, OH as well as the part west of Whiting, IN.
