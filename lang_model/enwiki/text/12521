A typical [[Jews|Jew]] in Jesus' time had only one name, sometimes supplemented with the father's name or the individual's hometown.<ref name=Britannica /> Thus, in the [[New Testament]], Jesus is referred to as "Jesus of Nazareth"{{efn|This article uses quotes from the [[New Revised Standard Version]] of the Bible.}} ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#26:71|Matthew 26:71]]), "Joseph's son" ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#4:22|Luke 4:22]]), and "Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth" ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#1:45|John 1:45]]). However, in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#6:3|Mark 6:3]], rather than being called the son of Joseph, he is referred to as "the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon".

The gospels offer several clues concerning the year of Jesus' birth.

The first to be written was the Gospel of Mark (written 60<U+2013>75 AD), followed by the Gospel of Matthew (65<U+2013>85 AD), the Gospel of Luke (65<U+2013>95 AD), and the Gospel of John (75<U+2013>100 AD).<ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=l2sloGWzzV8C&pg=PA58#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Can We Trust the Gospels?: Investigating the Reliability of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John | publisher=Crossway | year=2007 | page=58 | isbn=978-1-4335-1978-9 |first= Mark D. |last= Roberts}}</ref> They often differ in content and in the ordering of events.<ref>{{cite book|last=Humphreys|first=Colin J.|title=The Mystery of the Last Supper: Reconstructing the Final Days of Jesus|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49631-5|pages=7<U+2013>8|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BEy1BZRRAPQC&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> Three of them, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, are known as the [[Synoptic Gospels]], from the Greek <U+03C3><U+03CD><U+03BD> (''syn'' "together") and <U+1F44><U+03C8><U+03B9><U+03C2> (''opsis'' "view").<ref name= Synoptic/><ref name=Synoptic2/><ref>{{OED|synoptic}}</ref> They are similar in content, narrative arrangement, language and paragraph structure.<ref name= Synoptic>{{cite book|title=New Testament Theology|first=Paul |last=Haffner|year=2008 |isbn= 978-88-902268-0-9 |page= 135}}</ref><ref name=Synoptic2>{{cite book|title=A Guide to the Gospels|first=W.

While the flow of some events, such as Jesus' [[Baptism of Jesus|baptism]], [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]], Crucifixion and interactions with the Apostles, are shared among the Synoptic Gospels, incidents such as the Transfiguration do not appear in John's Gospel, which also differs on other matters, such as the [[Cleansing of the Temple]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ladd|first=George E.|title=A Theology of the New Testament|year=1993|publisher=Wm.

According to the majority viewpoint, the Synoptic Gospels are the primary sources of historical information about Jesus.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=73}} However, not everything contained in the New Testament gospels is considered to be historically reliable.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=3}} Elements whose historical authenticity is disputed include the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]], the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]], the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]], some of [[Miracles of Jesus|Jesus' miracles]], and the [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|Sanhedrin trial]], among others.{{sfn|Crossan|Watts|1999|p=108}}{{sfn|Dunn|2003|pp=779<U+2013>781}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Funk |first=Robert W. | title=The acts of Jesus: the search for the authentic deeds of Jesus |year=1998 |publisher=Harper |pages=449<U+2013>495 |isbn=978-0-06-062979-3}}</ref> Views on the gospels range from their being [[inerrancy|inerrant]] descriptions of the life of Jesus{{sfn|Grudem|1994|pp=90<U+2013>91}} to their providing no historical information about his life.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Howard M. |last= Teeple |year=1970 |title=The Oral Tradition That Never Existed |journal=Journal of Biblical Literature |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=56<U+2013>68}}</ref>

The gospels include a number of discourses by Jesus on specific occasions, such as the [[Sermon on the Mount]] and the [[Farewell Discourse]].

Accounts of the [[Genealogy of Jesus|genealogy]] and Nativity of Jesus appear in the New Testament only in the gospels of Luke and Matthew. Outside the New Testament, documents exist that are more or less contemporary with Jesus and the gospels, but few shed any light on biographical details of his life, and these two gospel accounts remain the main sources of information on the genealogy and Nativity.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=3}}

Matthew [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#1:1|begins his gospel]] with the genealogy of Jesus, before giving an account of Jesus' birth. He traces Jesus' ancestry to Abraham through David. [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:23|Luke 3:22]] discusses the genealogy after describing the baptism of Jesus, when the voice from Heaven addresses Jesus and identifies him as the [[Son of God]].

The gospels present John the Baptist's ministry as the precursor of that of Jesus. Starting with his baptism, Jesus begins his ministry in the countryside of Judea, near the River Jordan, when he is "about thirty years old" ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:23|Luke 3:23]]). He then travels, preaches and performs miracles, eventually completing his ministry with the Last Supper with his disciples in Jerusalem.{{sfn|McGrath|2006|pp=16<U+2013>22}}

Near the beginning of his ministry, Jesus [[Commissioning of the Twelve Apostles|appoints twelve apostles]]. In Matthew and Mark, despite Jesus only briefly requesting that they join him, Jesus' first four apostles, who were fishermen, are described as immediately consenting, and abandoning their nets and boats to do so ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#4:18|Matthew 4:18<U+2013>22]], [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#1:16|Mark 1:16<U+2013>20]]). In John, Jesus' first two apostles were disciples of John the Baptist. The Baptist sees Jesus and calls him the [[Lamb of God]]; the two hear this and follow Jesus.{{sfn|Brown|1988|pp= 25<U+2013>27}}{{sfn|Boring|Craddock|2004|pages= 292<U+2013>293}} In addition to the Twelve Apostles, the opening of the passage of the [[Sermon on the Plain]] identifies a much larger group of people as disciples ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#6:17|Luke 6:17]]). Also, in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#10:1|Luke 10:1<U+2013>16]] Jesus sends [[Seventy disciples|seventy or seventy-two of his followers]] in pairs to prepare towns for his prospective visit. They are instructed to accept hospitality, heal the sick and spread the word that the Kingdom of God is coming.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=The Gospel According to Luke | encyclopedia=New Collegeville Bible Commentary: New Testament | publisher=Liturgical Press | year=2009 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sdooTRyPMCwC&pg=PA255#v=onepage&q&f=false | page=255 | first=Michael F. | last=Patella | editor-first=Daniel | editor-last=Durken | isbn=978-0-8146-3260-4}}</ref>

As Jesus travels towards Jerusalem, in the [[Perea (Bible)|Perean]] ministry, he returns to the area where he was baptized, about a third of the way down from the [[Sea of Galilee]] along the Jordan ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#10:40|John 10:40<U+2013>42]]).{{sfn|Cox|Easley|2007|p=137}}{{sfn|Redford|2007| pp= 211<U+2013>229}} The [[Ministry of Jesus#Final ministry in Jerusalem|final ministry in Jerusalem]] begins with the Jesus' [[triumphal entry into Jerusalem|triumphal entry]] into the city on [[Palm Sunday]].{{sfn|Cox|Easley|2007|pp=155<U+2013>170}} In the Synoptic Gospels, during that week Jesus drives the money changers from the Temple and [[Bargain of Judas|Judas bargains to betray]] him.

Commentaries often discuss the teachings of Jesus in terms of his "words and works".<ref name=WPent212 />{{sfn|Walvoord|Zuck|1983|p=346}} The words include a number of sermons, as well as parables that appear throughout the narrative of the Synoptic Gospels (the Gospel of John includes no narrative parables).

John's Gospel presents the teachings of Jesus not merely as his own preaching, but as divine revelation. John the Baptist, for example, states in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#3:34|John 3:34]]: "He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure." In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#7:16|John 7:16]] Jesus says, "My teaching is not mine but his who sent me." He asserts the same thing in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#14:10|John 14:10]]: "Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works."<ref name="autogenerated98"/><ref>{{cite book|title=The missions of Jesus and the disciples according to the Fourth Gospel| first=Andreas J.|last= K<U+00F6>stenberger|year= 1998| isbn= 978-0-8028-4255-8 |publisher=Wm.

During the trials Jesus speaks very little, mounts no defense and gives very infrequent and indirect answers to the questions of the priests, prompting an officer to slap him. In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#26:62|Matthew 26:62]] Jesus' unresponsiveness leads Caiaphas to ask him, "Have you no answer?"{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=487<U+2013>500}}{{sfn|Blomberg|2009|pp=396<U+2013>400}}<ref name=Holman608 /> In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#14:61|Mark 14:61]] the high priest then asks Jesus, "Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?".

Observing a Passover custom of the time, Pilate allows one prisoner chosen by the crowd to be released. He gives the people a choice between Jesus and a murderer called [[Barabbas]].

Jesus' crucifixion is described in all four canonical gospels. After the trials, Jesus is led to Calvary [[Christ Carrying the Cross|carrying his cross]]; the route traditionally thought to have been taken is known as the [[Via Dolorosa]]. The three Synoptic Gospels indicate that [[Simon of Cyrene]] assists him, having been compelled by the Romans to do so.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=509<U+2013>520}}{{sfn|K<U+00F6>stenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|pp=211<U+2013>214}} In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#23:27|Luke 23:27<U+2013>28]] Jesus tells the women in the multitude of people following him not to weep for him but for themselves and their children.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=509<U+2013>520}} At Calvary, Jesus is offered a concoction usually offered as a painkiller.

The soldiers then crucify Jesus and cast lots for his clothes. Above Jesus' head on the cross is Pilate's inscription, "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews"; soldiers and passers-by mock him about it. Jesus is crucified between two convicted thieves, one of whom rebukes Jesus, while the other defends him.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=509<U+2013>520}}{{sfn|Doninger|1999|p=271}} The Roman soldiers break the two thieves' legs (a procedure designed to hasten death in a crucifixion), but they do not break those of Jesus, as he is already dead. In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John 19:34|John 19:34]], one soldier pierces Jesus' side with a lance, and water flows out.{{sfn|Doninger|1999|p=271}} In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#27:51|Matthew 27:51<U+2013>54]], when Jesus dies, the heavy curtain at the Temple is torn and an earthquake breaks open tombs.

On the same day, [[Joseph of Arimathea]], with Pilate's permission and with [[Nicodemus]]' help, [[Descent from the Cross|removes Jesus' body from the cross]], wraps him in a clean cloth and buries him in a new [[Sepulchre|rock-hewn tomb]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=509<U+2013>520}} In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#27:62|Matthew 27:62<U+2013>66]], on the following day the Jews ask Pilate for the tomb to be sealed with a stone and placed under guard to ensure the body will remain there.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=509<U+2013>520}}{{sfn|Morris|1992|page=727}}

=== Resurrection and ascension ===
{{Main|Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection appearances of Jesus|Ascension of Jesus}}

New Testament accounts of Jesus' resurrection state that on the first day of the week after the crucifixion (typically interpreted as a Sunday), his tomb is discovered to be empty and his followers encounter him risen from the dead. His followers arrive at the tomb early in the morning and meet either one or two beings (men or angels) dressed in bright robes. [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#16:9|Mark 16:9]] and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#20:15|John 20:15]] indicate that Jesus appears to [[Mary Magdalene]] first, and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#16:9|Luke 16:9]] states that she is one of the [[myrrhbearers]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=521<U+2013>530}}{{sfn|Cox|Easley|2007|pp=216<U+2013>226}}

After the discovery of the empty tomb, Jesus makes a series of appearances to the disciples.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=521<U+2013>530}} These include the [[Doubting Thomas]] episode and the [[Road to Emmaus appearance|appearance on the road to Emmaus]], where Jesus meets two disciples.

Before he ascends into heaven, Jesus [[Great Commission|commissions his disciples]] to spread his teachings to all the nations of the world. [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#24:51|Luke 24:51]] states that Jesus is then "carried up into heaven". The Ascension account is elaborated in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#1:1|Acts 1:1<U+2013>11]] and mentioned in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Timothy#3:16|1 Timothy 3:16]]. In Acts, forty days after the Resurrection, as the disciples look on, "he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight". [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Peter#3:22|1 Peter 3:22]] states that Jesus has "gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God".{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=521<U+2013>530}}

{{see also|Biblical criticism}}

Prior to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the gospels were usually regarded as accurate historical accounts, but since then scholars have emerged who question the reliability of the gospels and draw a distinction between the Jesus described in the gospels and the Jesus of history.{{sfn|Levine|2006|p=5}} Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during the quest that applied them.{{sfn|Witherington|1997|pp=9<U+2013>13}}{{sfn|Powell|1998|pp=19<U+2013>23}} Scholars have studied and debated a number of issues concerning the historical Jesus, such as his existence, the origins and historical reliability of the gospels and other sources, and the precise portrait of the historical figure.

Approaches to the historical reconstruction of the life of Jesus have varied from the "maximalist" approaches of the 19th century, in which the gospel accounts were accepted as reliable evidence wherever it is possible, to the "minimalist" approaches of the early 20th century, where hardly anything about Jesus was accepted as historical.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Historical Jesus of the Gospels|first= Craig S.|last= Keener |year= 2012 | isbn= 978-0-8028-6292-1 |publisher=William B.

Most modern scholars consider Jesus' baptism and crucifixion to be definite historical facts. [[James Dunn (theologian)|James D. G.

Judaic criticism of Jesus is long-standing. The New Testament states that Jesus was criticized by the Jewish authorities of his time. The [[Pharisee]]s and [[scribe]]s criticized Jesus and his disciples for not observing the Mosaic Law, for not washing their hands before eating ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#7:1|Mark 7:1<U+2013>23]], [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#15:1|Matthew 15:1<U+2013>20]]), and for gathering grain on the Sabbath ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#2:23|Mark 2:23<U+2013>3:6]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Baggett|first=John|title=Seeing Through the Eyes of Jesus|year=2008|publisher=Wm.

Despite the lack of biblical references or historical records, a wide range of depictions of Jesus have appeared during the last two millennia, often influenced by cultural settings, political circumstances and theological contexts.{{sfn|Houlden|2006|pp=63<U+2013>99}}<ref name=Erricker44 >{{cite book|title=Teaching Christianity: a world religions approach|first= Clive|last= Erricker|year= 1987 |isbn= 978-0-7188-2634-5 |page= 44 |publisher=James Clarke & Co}}</ref><ref name=Perkinson30 /> As in other [[Christian art]], the earliest depictions date to the late second or early third century, and surviving images are found especially in the [[Catacombs of Rome]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The New Westminster Dictionary of Church History|first= Robert |last=Benedetto|year= 2006| isbn= 978-0-664-22416-5 |pages= 51<U+2013>53 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press}}</ref>

{{Main|Relics associated with Jesus}}

Throughout the history of Christianity a number of [[relic]]s attributed to Jesus have been claimed and displayed. While some people believe in the authenticity of some relics, others have cast doubt on them. For instance, the 16th-century Catholic theologian [[Erasmus]] wrote sarcastically about the proliferation of relics and the number of buildings that could have been constructed from the wood claimed to be from the [[True Cross|cross used in the Crucifixion]].{{sfn|Dillenberger|1999|p=5}} Similarly, while experts debate whether Jesus was crucified with three nails or with four, at least thirty [[holy nail]]s continue to be venerated as relics across Europe.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle =Holy Nails|title=Holy Nails|first= Herbert|last=Thurston}}</ref> Some relics, such as purported remnants of the Crown of Thorns, receive only a modest number of pilgrims, while the [[Shroud of Turin]] (which is associated with an approved [[Catholic devotion]] to the [[Holy Face of Jesus]]), have received millions,<ref>{{cite news|last=Delaney|first=Sarah|title=Shroud exposition closes with more than 2 million visits|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1002157.htm|newspaper=Catholic News Service|date=May 24, 2010}}</ref> including [[Pope John Paul II]] and [[Pope Benedict XVI]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Wojty<U+0142>a |first=Karol J.|title=Pope John Paul II's address in Turin Cathedral|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/travels/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_24051998_sindone_en.html|publisher=Vatican Publishing House|date=May 24, 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Squires|first=Nick|title=Pope Benedict says Shroud of Turin authentic burial robe of Jesus|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2010/0503/Pope-Benedict-says-Shroud-of-Turin-authentic-burial-robe-of-Jesus|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=May 3, 2010}}</ref> Modern scholarship strongly doubts the authenticity of all relics attributed to Jesus.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nickell|first=Joe|title=Relics of the Christ|year=2007|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-3731-5|page=191|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=J-m_mblG-A8C&pg=PT210&dq=most+scholars+jesus+relics+authentic&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ClkAUoeyMonm8wSwhoGQBA&ved=0CGkQ6AEwBw#v=snippet&q=not%20a%20single%2C%20reliably%20authenticated%20relic%20of%20Jesus%20exists&f=false}}</ref>
