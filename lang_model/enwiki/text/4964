'''El Al Israel Airlines''' ({{lang-he|<U+05D0><U+05DC> <U+05E2><U+05DC>}}, "skyward") ([[Tel Aviv Stock Exchange|TASE]]: [http://www.tase.co.il/TASEEng/General/Company/companyDetails.htm?companyId=001152 ELAL]) is the [[flag carrier]] and largest [[airline]] of [[Israel]].<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.galbithink.org/topics/ka/priv.htm | title=Divestiture of Flag Carriers | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=Galbi Think}}</ref><ref name="antimissiles">{{citeweb | url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=683390&contrassID=1&subContrassID=5 | title=El Al Airlines installs anti-missile systems on passenger aircraft| accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=Haaretz|quote=El Al, Israel's national carrier and largest airline|date=[[2006-02-15]]}}</ref> From its main base and hub at [[Tel Aviv|Tel Aviv's]] [[Ben Gurion International Airport]], El Al operates regular international passenger and cargo flights to [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]], and [[North America]] as well as local flights to [[Eilat]].<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.elal.co.il/ELAL/English/FlightInfo/FlightSchedule/ | title=El Al Flight Schedule | accessdate=2007-05-28 | publisher= El Al}}</ref>

Since its inaugural flight from Geneva to Tel Aviv in September 1948, the airline has steadily grown, and now serves 48 destinations on four continents.<ref name="History of El Al">{{citeweb | url=http://www.elal.co.il/ELAL/English/AboutElAl/ | title=History of El Al | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=El Al}}</ref> As the national carrier, El Al has played an important role in Israel's  humanitarian rescue efforts, airlifting Jews from [[Ethiopia]], [[Yemen]], and other countries where their lives were in danger. The airline holds several world records, one of them for the highest number of passengers on a commercial aircraft, a record set by [[Operation Solomon]], when Jewish refugees were brought over from Ethiopia. El Al is regarded as the most secure airline in the world, after foiling many attempted hijackings and terror attacks through its vigilant security protocols.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/sept11/2001/10/01/elal-usat.htm | title= Unfriendly skies are no match for El Al| publisher=USA Today |date=[[2001-01-10]]|last=Walt|first=Vivienne| accessdate=2007-04-29 }}</ref>

== History ==
===Early years===
In September 1948, [[Israel]]'s first [[President of Israel|president]], [[Chaim Weizmann]], attended a conference in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. Weizmann was scheduled to fly back to Israel in a government aircraft, but due to the embargo imposed on Israel at the time, this was not possible. A [[C-54]] military transport aircraft was converted into a civilian plane for this purpose. The aircraft was painted with the '''El Al/Israel National Aviation Company''' logo and fitted with extra fuel tanks to enable a non-stop flight from Geneva to Israel. It departed from [[Tel Nof Israeli Air Force Base|Ekron Air Base]] on [[September 28]], and returned to Israel on [[September 30]]. After the flight, the aircraft was repainted and returned to military use.<ref name="answers">{{citeweb | url=http://www.answers.com/topic/el-al-israel-airlines-ltd | title=El Al Company History | accessdate=2007-05-27 | publisher=Answers.com Premium Partner}}</ref> 

The airline was incorporated and became Israel's official carrier on [[November 15]], [[1948]], although it used borrowed aircraft until February 1959, when two unpressurised [[DC-4]]'s were purchased from [[American Airlines]]. The acquisition was funded by the [[Politics of Israel|Israeli government]], the [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency]], and other Jewish organizations. The first plane arrived at [[Ben Gurion International Airport|Lod Airport]] on [[April 3]], [[1949]]. Aryeh Pincus, a lawyer from [[South Africa]], was elected head of the company. The first international flight, from [[Tel Aviv]] to [[Paris]] (refueling in Rome), took place on [[July 31]], [[1949]].<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/13400/edition_id/259/format/html/displaystory.html | title=El Al flies to rescue throughout the world | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=Jewish News Weekly of Northern California|last=Kanon|first=Sharon|date=[[2000-04-07]]}}</ref><ref name="answers" /> By the end of 1949, the airline had flown passengers to London and Johannesburg. A regular service to London was inaugurated in the middle of 1950.  Later that year, El Al acquired Universal Airways, which was owned by South African Zionists. A state-run domestic airline, [[Arkia Israel Airlines|Israel Inland Airlines]], was founded in which El Al had a 50% stake.<ref name="answers" />

El Al's cargo service was inaugurated in 1950, and initially relied on military surplus [[C-46]] aircraft. That same year, the airline initiated charter services to the [[USA]], followed by scheduled flights soon afterwards.<ref name="answers" /> From its earliest days, operation of the airline in keeping with Jewish tradition has been a source of friction. When the Israeli prime minister [[David Ben Gurion]] was forming his first coalition, the religious parties would not join unless Ben Gurion promised that El Al would serve only [[kosher]] food on its flights and would not fly on the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]].<ref name="shabbat">{{citeweb | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20010222124207/http://www.jewishgates.org/history/modhis/elal.stm | title=El-Al, Israel's Airline | accessdate=2007-05-27 | publisher=Gates of Jewish Heritage}}</ref>
[[Image:El Al ocean ad.png|thumb|200px|El Al's 1958 ad promoting non-stop transatlantic services]]

As the national carrier, the airline was involved in several covert operations. In the early 1950s, El Al airlifted over 160,000 immigrants to Israel from [[History of the Jews in India|India]], [[History of the Jews in Iran|Iran]], [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Iraq]] and [[Yemenite Jews|Yemen]] as part of [[Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)|Operation Magic Carpet]] and [[Operation Ezra and Nehemiah]].<ref name="History of El Al" />  In 1960, [[Nazi]] war criminal [[Adolf Eichmann]] was captured and flown from Argentina to Israel on an El Al aircraft.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874118-2,00.html | title=The Beast in Chains | publisher=Time Magazine | date=[[1960-06-06]]| accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref>
In 1955, after using unreliable and noisy [[Lockheed Constellation]]s for several years, the airline purchased two [[Bristol Britannia]] aircraft. El Al was the second airline in the world to fly this plane, after the [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]].

In 1958, El Al ran a newspaper advertisement in the [[USA|US]] featuring a picture of a "shrunken" Atlantic Ocean ("Starting Dec. 23, the Atlantic Ocean will be 20% smaller") to promote its non-stop [[transatlantic]] flights.<REF>{{cite news| url=http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:uff0IpxEuXsJ:www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,937575,00.html%3Fiid%3Dchix-sphere+%22el+al%22+advertisement+1958&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=8&client=firefox-a | title=Adman's Adman | accessdate=2007-05-28 | publisher=Time Magazine| date=[[1958-03-31]]}}</ref> This was a bold step: The airline industry had never used images of the ocean in its advertising because of the widespread public fear of airline crashes. The advertisement, which ran only once, proved effective. Within a year, El Al's sales tripled.<ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.ciadvertising.org/studies/student/98_fall/theory/weirtz/doyle.htm | title=Doyle Dane Bernbach | accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref>

===Expansion in the 1960s===

Despite the purchase of Britannias and inauguration of non-stop transatlantic flights, the airline remained unprofitable.<ref name="answers" /> When Efraim Ben-Arzi took over the company in the late 1950s, the Britannias were replaced by [[de Havilland Comet|de Havilland Comet 4]], [[Boeing 707]], and [[Douglas DC-8]] jets. The first year that El Al turned a profit was 1960. That year, more than 50 percent of the passengers flying into Israel arrived on El Al flights.<ref name="answers" /> On [[15 June]] [[1961]], the airline set a world record for the longest non-stop commercial flight: An El Al [[Boeing 707]] flew from Tel Aviv to [[New York]], covering 5,760 miles in 9 hours and 33 minutes.<ref name="History of El Al" />
By this time, El Al was carrying 56,000 passengers a year - on a par with [[Qantas]] and ahead of established airlines like [[Loftleidir]]. In 1961, El Al ranked 35th in the world in the number of accumulated passenger-miles.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Commercial_Aviation/ElAl/Tran25.htm | title=El Al, the Israeli Airline | accessdate=2007-05-28 | publisher=US Centennial of Flight}}</ref>
El Al's success continued into the late 1960s. In 1968, regular flights to [[Bucharest]] were inaugurated, and cargo flights began to Europe and the USA. The airline also established a catering subsidiary, Teshet Tourism and Aviation Services Ltd. All these ventures brought in an annual profit of $2 million that year.<ref name="answers" />

===El Al as a target of hijacking and terrorism===
In 1968, El Al experienced what would become the first of many acts of terrorism against the airline. On [[July 23]], the first and only successful hijacking of an El Al aircraft took place when a 707 carrying 10 crew and 38 passengers was taken over by three members of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP). The aircraft was en route from [[Rome]], [[Italy]], to [[Lod]], [[Israel]]. The hijackers diverted it to [[Algiers]]. Bargaining with the hijackers went on for 40 days. Both the hijackers and the passengers, including 21 Israeli hostages, were eventually freed. The hijackers had departed from Beirut armed, with the full consent of the Lebanese authorities.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942267-2,00.html | title=Drama of the Desert: The Week of the Hostages | date=[[1970-09-21]]|accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=TIME}}</ref> On [[December 26]], two PFLP terrorists attacked an El Al aircraft at Athens Airport, killing an Israeli mechanic.<ref name="TVNZ"/> Again, Lebanon was held accountable for the attack. The [[IDF]] retaliated on [[December 29]] with a nighttime raid on Lebanon's [[Beirut Airport]] airport, destroying 14 planes on the ground belonging to [[Middle East Airlines]], [[Trans Mediterranean Airways]] and Lebanese International Airways.<REF>{{cite web

===1970s and 1980s===
[[Image:El Al 707 at Zurich 1982.jpg|An El Al [[Boeing 707]] at [[Zurich Airport]] in June 1982|thumb|right]]

El Al acquired its first [[Boeing 747]] in 1971. Many felt it was a risky purchase, given the high cost of the plane and fear of attacks, but El Al operations flourished, and the airline was highly regarded around the world despite a fleet of only twelve aircraft. Another 747 was delivered in 1973. This was the plane used to inaugurate nonstop service from Tel Aviv to New York. In the air for thirteen hours, and flying against prevailing winds, it was recorded as the longest commercial airplane flight in the world.<ref name="answers" /> 

In the mid-1970s, El Al began to schedule flights from airports outside of Israel that departed on [[Shabbat]] and landed in Israel when Shabbat was over. The religious parties in the government claimed that this was a violation of Jewish law and contrary to the agreement signed in the early days of the state, when El Al promised to refrain from flying on Shabbat. This dispute culminated in the fall of the Labor government. Elections were held, and the new prime minister, [[Menachem Begin]], promised to abide by the agreement. Outraged, the secular community threatened to boycott the airline. In August 1982, El Al workers blocked Orthodox and Hassidic Jews from entering the airport.<ref name="shabbat" /> 

In 1977, El Al established a charter subsidiary then known as El Al Charter Services Ltd., but later renamed [[Sun D'Or|Sun D'Or International Airlines Ltd]]. Two years earlier, the airline had suffered its first losses since the late 1950s, largely a product of the global recession. The management was changed three times towards the end of the 1970s, until Itzhak Shander was named president. As the political situation in Iran deteriorated, El Al began to airlift Jews to Israel. All the airline's infrastructure in Iran was eventually torched and destroyed.<ref name="answers" />
El Al flights to [[Cairo]] were inaugurated in April 1980, following the [[Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty|peace agreement]] with Egypt.<ref name="History of El Al" />  In late 1982, after a long period of labor disputes and strikes, El Al operations were suspended. The government appointed Amram Blum to run the company, which lost $123.3 million in the fiscal year ending April 1983.<ref name="answers" /> The airline also sold its stake in [[Arkia]] at this time.<ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/israel/sde_dov.htm | title=Sde Dov/Tel Aviv | accessdate=2007-05-27 | publisher=Global Security}}</ref>

Operations resumed in January 1983 under receivership. The government purchased two new [[Boeing 737]] aircraft and announced plans to acquire four [[Boeing 767]] jets at the cost of $200 million. Within four years, El-Al was profitable again.<ref name="answers" /> It broke another record in May 1988 with a non-stop flight from [[Los Angeles]] to Tel Aviv, a journey of 7,000 miles in 13 hours and 41 minutes.<ref name="History of El Al" /> Flights to Poland and Yugoslavia were inaugurated in 1989.<ref name="answers" />

===1990s and early 2000s===
[[Image:elal.b747.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|El Al Boeing 747-200 such as that operated in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s]]

In January 1990, [[North American Airlines]] began flying to Israel, in part to provide feeder services to El Al gateways in North America. El Al held a 24.9% stake in the airline until selling it back to Dan McKinnon in July 2003. By this time, El Al was operating a fleet of 20 aircraft, including nine Boeing 747s, and had begun replacing its aging Boeing 707s with the [[Boeing 757]]. Early that year, El Al inaugurated regular flights to [[Moscow]] following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]]. No airlifts were possible at this time, but permission was granted in 1991. Charter flights commenced in August 1991, with immigrants also occupying all  available seats on El Al's scheduled routes. In cooperation with [[Aeroflot]], El Al flew  more than 400,000 Jewish immigrants to Israel within a three year period.<ref name="answers" /><ref>

On [[24 May]] [[1991]] an El Al [[Boeing 747]] airlifted a record-breaking 1,087  [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jews]] flying from [[Addis Ababa]] to Israel in the framework of [[Operation Solomon]].<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://library.thinkquest.org/J0110426/records/records1.html | title=Aviation World Records | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=Think Quest}}</ref> Flights were inaugurated to the [[Far East]], and in 1995, El Al signed its first code-sharing agreement with [[American Airlines]].<ref name="answers" /> In February 1995, the technical receivership under which the airline had been operating since 1982 came to an end.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/3508/edition_id/62/format/html/displaystory.html | title=El Al Airlines posts $15 million profits | accessdate=2007-05-07| date=[[1996-04-26]] | publisher=Jewish Bulletin Online}}</ref> In June 1996, El Al recorded another milestone: its first flight from Israel to [[Amman]], [[Jordan]].<ref name="History of El Al" /> [[Image:Operation Solomon.jpg|thumb|right|Ethiopian Jews boarding El Al aircraft during Operation Solomon]] $83.1 million in losses were recorded that year, due to the resumption of  terrorism and the government's open-skies policy.<ref name="answers" /> In order to keep its planes flying during this difficult period, El Al introduced flights "to nowhere": Passengers were offered various kinds of in-flight entertainment as the plane circled the Mediterranean. One-day shopping trips to London and visits to newly opened religious sites in eastern Europe were also promoted.<ref name="answers" />

In 1997, El Al opened a separate cargo division.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.elal.co.il/ELAL/English/ELALCargo/ | title=El Al Cargo Profile | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=El Al}}</ref> El Al's first [[Boeing 777]] embarked on its maiden flight in March 2000. Later that year, the controversy over flights on Shabbat erupted again, when the airline announced that it was losing $55 million a year by grounding its planes on Saturdays. After the first phase of the long-delayed privatization of the company commenced in June 2003, and 15% of El Al's shares were listed on the [[Tel Aviv Stock Exchange]], the policy regarding Sabbath flights was expected to change.<ref name="History of El Al" /><ref name="shabbat" /> 

In 2004, Knafaim-Arkia Holdings, the parent company of [[Arkia Israel Airlines]] acquired a large stake in [[Arkia]] and intended to seek full  ownership.<ref name="History of El Al" /><ref name="shabbat" /> However, due to Israeli anti-trust laws, Knafaim-Arkia was forced to sell its shares.<REF>{{cite news

==Religious controversy==
El Al caters to the needs of religious Jewish passengers flying to and from Israel by serving only kosher food (under rabbinical supervision; glatt kosher food is also available on request). On long-haul flights, passenger-led prayer services are held at the back of the plane.  El Al does not fly on [[Shabbat]], despite the financial losses that this entails. An estimated 20-30% of the passengers are ultra-Orthodox. This sector tends to fly during specific seasons of the year (before and after Jewish holidays), and has certain preferred destinations, such as New York and Toronto. Operating on Shabbat could result in a [[Haredi]] boycott that would pose a major financial blow and cripple the airline. <ref>{{cite news| title=Potential ultra-Orthodox boycott threatens to cripple El Al airlines |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/796900.html |date=[[2006-12-05]] |last=Ettinger |first=Yair|publisher=Haaretz| quote=An official boycott could deal a fatal blow to El Al|accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref> After an airport strike in November 2006, El Al allowed some planes to take off on Shabbat to reduce the backlog.

==El Al security==

As a target of terrorism for many decades, El Al employs stringent security procedures, both on the ground and aboard its aircraft. These effective, though sometimes controversial, procedures have won El Al the reputation of being the most secure airline in the world.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/sept11/2001/10/01/elal-usat.htm | title= 
Unfriendly skies are no match for El Al | date=[[2001-01-10]]| last=Walt| first=Vivienne| accessdate=2007-04-29| publisher=USA Today}}</ref> 

===Airport security measures===
Passengers are asked to report three hours before departure. All El Al terminals around the world are closely monitored for security. There are plainclothes agents and fully armed  police or military personnel who patrol the premises for explosives, suspicious behavior, and other threats. Inside the terminal, passengers and their baggage are checked by a trained team. El Al security procedures require that all passengers be interviewed individually prior to boarding, allowing El Al staff to identify possible security threats. Passengers will be asked questions about where they are coming from, the reason for their trip, their job or occupation, and whether they have packed their bags themselves. The likelihood of potential terrorists remaining calm under such questioning is believed to be low  (see also ''[[Microexpression]]'').<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2001/09/12/israelisecurity.htm | title=Israeli-style security might have averted hijackings | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=USA Today| date=[[2001-09-13]]}}</ref>
At the [[check-in]] counter, the passenger's [[passport]] and [[Airline ticket|ticket]] are closely examined. A ticket without a sticker from the [[security]] checkers will not be accepted. At passport control, the person's name is passed through computer checks utilizing information from the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] (CSIS), [[Scotland Yard]], [[Shin Bet]] and [[Interpol]] databases. Luggage is screened and sometimes hand searched. In addition, bags are put through a decompression chamber simulating pressures during flight that could trigger explosives.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.segl.com/xj.php | title=El Al Decompression Chamber | accessdate=2006-07-18 | publisher=Simcoe Engineering Group Limited}}</ref> El Al is the only airline in the world that passes all luggage through such a chamber.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.israelinsider.com/channels/security/articles/sec_0108.htm | title=El Al's legendary security measures set industry standards | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=Israel Insider | date=[[2001-10-03]]}}</ref> Even at overseas airports, El Al security agents conduct all luggage searches personally, even if they are supervised by government or private security firms.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2006-05-12-el-al-security_x.htm | title=El Al wants to do own bag screening at Newark | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=USA Today | date=[[2006-05-12]]}}</ref>

===Flight security measures===
[[Undercover]] agents (sometimes referred to as [[sky marshal|sky marshals]]) carrying concealed firearms sit amongst the passengers on every international El Al flight.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2097352.stm | title=El Al sets security standards | date=[[2002-07-05]]| accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=BBC News}}</ref> Most El Al pilots are former [[Israeli Air Force]] fighter pilots, and all El Al flight crew members are trained in hand-to-hand combat. Most El Al employees, male and female, have served in the [[Israel Defense Force]], as Israeli citizens are drafted at the age of 18. <ref name="Security">{{cite news| url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/meast/09/26/rec.el.al.security | title=Model for air travel security may be El Al | date=[[2001-09-26]]| accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=CNN}}</ref>
[[Image:Elal.b777-200.4x-ecd.arp.jpg|thumb|El Al Boeing 777]]

The cockpits in all El Al aircraft have double doors to prevent entry by unauthorized persons. A [[password|code]] is required to access the doors, and the second door will only be opened after the first has closed and the person has been identified by the [[Captain]] or [[First Officer]].<ref name="Security" /> Furthermore, there are reinforced [[steel]] floors separating the [[passenger]] [[cabin]] from the [[baggage]] hold.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=2&ObjectID=10396216 | title=Flying under the eagle eyes of El Al's famed high security | accessdate=2006-08-15 | publisher=New Zealand Herald|last=Silver |first=Eric| date=[[2006-08-15]]}}</ref> This is intended to strengthen the plane in case of an explosion. The El Al fleet is also the only commercial airline fleet in the world to be equipped with anti-missile [[countermeasures]], utilizing the radar-based Flight Guard system.<ref name="antimissiles" /> [[Switzerland]] and other European countries have expressed concern that [[flares]] dropped by this automated system could cause fires in the vicinity of the airport.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3221013,00.html | title=Europe objects to El Al's anti-missile shield | accessdate=2006-11-12 | last=Beck | first=Eldad| date=[[2006-02-26]]| publisher=Ynet News}}</ref> El Al does not divulge information about these systems.

===Security controversy and passenger profiling===

According to a report published by the Center Against Racism and the Arab Association for Human Rights in December 2006, during El Al security checks passengers are racially profiled.<ref name="ArabReport">{{cite web | url=http://www.no-racism.org/arabic/data/publications/AirportReportEnglish.pdf | title=Suspected Citizens: Racial Profiling Against Arab Passengers by Israeli Airlines and Airports | last=Tarek |first=Ibrahim|year=2006| month=December |accessdate=2007-03-01}}</ref> The report goes further to claim that this is unfair, irrational, and degrading to those undergoing the stringent screening procedures.

On the other hand, there are those, such as the political analyst [[Daniel Pipes]], who do not consider the policy of passenger profiling to be racist. According to Pipes, "however distasteful, there must be special scrutiny of Muslims in the West for security purposes."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.danielpipes.org/blog/650 | title=What Security Measures vis-<U+00E0>-vis Western Muslims? | first=Daniel |last=Pipes|authorlink=Daniel Pipes|date=[[2006-08-10]]| accessdate=2007-03-01}}</ref>

The airline was also criticised by the Hungarian courts for refusing to search luggage with the passenger present, acting against Hungarian domestic laws which stipulate that only authorized officials are able to undertake such searches.<Ref name="ArabReport"/>

Stringent security measures have ensured that no El Al aircraft has been successfully hijacked since 1968. Most recently, on [[November 17]], [[2002]], Tawfiq Fukra, a twenty-three-year-old [[Israeli Arab]], attempted to hijack an El Al flight from Tel Aviv to Turkey. He was reportedly armed with a pocket knife and attempted to break into the cockpit in order to fly the aircraft back to Israel and crash it into a building, but was apprehended by on-board security personnel.<REF>{{cite news
