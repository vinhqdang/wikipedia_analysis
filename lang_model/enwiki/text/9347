'''Autism''' is a [[Neurodevelopmental disorders|brain development disorder]] characterized by impairments in social interaction and communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior, all exhibited before a child is three years old. These characteristics distinguish autism from milder [[autism spectrum disorders]] (ASD).

[[Heritability]] contributes a large fraction of the risk of a child's developing the disorder, although the [[Heritability of autism|genetics of autism]] are complex, and it is generally unclear which genes are responsible.<ref name=Freitag/> In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with [[Teratology|agents]] that cause birth defects.<ref name=Arndt/> Other proposed [[Causes of autism|causes]], such as the exposure of children to vaccines, are [[Controversies in autism|controversial]] and the vaccine hypotheses are unsupported by convincing [[Evidence-based medicine|scientific evidence]].<ref name=Rutter/> Most recent reviews estimate a [[prevalence]] of one to two cases per 1,000 people for autism, and about six per 1,000 for ASD, with ASD averaging a 4.3:1 male-to-female ratio. The number of people known to have autism has increased dramatically since the 1980s, at least partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether prevalence has increased is unresolved.<ref name=Newschaffer/>

Autism affects many parts of the brain; how this occurs is poorly understood. Parents usually notice signs in the first year or two of their child's life. Early intervention may help children gain self-care and social skills, although few of these interventions are supported by scientific studies; there is no cure.<ref name=Francis/> With severe autism, independent living is unlikely; with milder autism, there are some success stories for adults,<ref name=Howlin/> and an [[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism|autistic culture]] has developed, with some seeking a cure and others believing that autism is a condition rather than a disorder.<ref name=Rajendran/>

==Classification==
[[Image:Asperger kl2.jpg|thumb|[[Hans Asperger]] described a form of ASD in the 1940s that later became known as [[Asperger's syndrome]].]]
Autism is a [[developmental disorder]] of the [[human brain]] that first shows signs during infancy or childhood and follows a steady course without [[Remission (medicine)|remission]] or [[relapse]].<ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/> Impairments result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain.<ref name=Penn/> Autism is one of the five [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD) or [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior.<ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/>

Of the other four autism spectrum disorders, [[Asperger's syndrome]] is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; [[Rett syndrome]] and [[childhood disintegrative disorder]] share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; [[PDD-NOS|pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS)]] is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Lord C, Cook EH, Leventhal BL, [[David Amaral|Amaral DG]]|title=Autism spectrum disorders|journal=Neuron|volume=28|issue=2|date=2000|pages=355<U+2013>63|doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(00)00115-X|pmid=11144346|url=http://download.neuron.org/pdfs/0896-6273/PIIS089662730000115X.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> Unlike autism, Asperger's has no substantial delay in [[language development]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|edition=4th ed., text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]])|author=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|date=2000|isbn=0890420254|chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 299.80 Asperger's Disorder (AD)|chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm|accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref> The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger's and PDD-NOS sometimes called the ''autistic disorders'',<ref name=Freitag>{{cite journal|author=Freitag CM|title=The genetics of autistic disorders and its clinical relevance: a review of the literature|journal=Mol Psychiatry|volume=12|issue=1|pages=2<U+2013>22|date=2007|doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001896|pmid=17033636|url=http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v12/n1/full/4001896a.html}}</ref> whereas autism itself is often called ''autistic disorder'', ''childhood autism'', or ''infantile autism''. In this article, ''autism'' refers to the classic autistic disorder, while other sources sometimes use ''autism'' to refer to autistic disorders or even ASD. ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism [[phenotype]] (BAP), which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like [[Trait (biology)|traits]], such as avoiding eye contact.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Piven J, Palmer P, Jacobi D, Childress D, Arndt S|title=Broader autism phenotype: evidence from a family history study of multiple-incidence autism families|journal=Am J Psychiatry|date=1997|volume=154|issue=2|pages=185<U+2013>90|pmid=9016266|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/154/2/185.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

The manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum, ranging from individuals with severe impairments<U+2014>who may be silent, [[Developmental Disability|mentally disabled]], and locked into hand flapping and rocking<U+2014>to less impaired individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, pedantic communication.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Happ<U+00E9> F|title=Understanding assets and deficits in autism: why success is more interesting than failure |journal=Psychologist |volume=12 |issue=11 |pages=540<U+2013>7 |date=1999|url=http://www.bps.org.uk/publications/thepsychologist/search-the-psychologist-online.cfm?fuseaction=inc_getFile&ID=133&Publication_ID=1|format=PDF}}</ref> Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- and [[high-functioning autism]] (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on [[IQ]] thresholds,<ref name=hypersystem/> or on how much support the individual requires in daily life; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial.

Some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills, as opposed to a failure to make progress. Several terms are used for this phenomenon, including [[regressive autism]], setback autism, and developmental stagnation. The validity of this distinction remains controversial; it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype.<ref name=Landa/><ref name=Volkmar>{{cite journal|author=Volkmar F, Chawarska K, Klin A|title=Autism in infancy and early childhood|journal=Annu Rev Psychol|date=2005|volume=56|pages=315<U+2013>36|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070159|pmid=15709938}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
Autism is distinguished by a pattern of symptoms rather than one single symptom. The main characteristics are impairments in social interaction, impairments in communication, restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis.<ref name=Filipek/>

===Social development===
People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic [[Temple Grandin]] described her inability to understand the social communication of [[neurotypical]]s as leaving her feeling "like an anthropologist on Mars".<ref>{{cite book|title=[[An Anthropologist on Mars]]: Seven Paradoxical Tales|author=[[Oliver Sacks|Sacks O]]|publisher=Knopf|date=1995|isbn=0679437851}}</ref>

Social impairments become apparent early in childhood and continue through adulthood. Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers have more striking social deviance; for example, they have less [[eye contact]] and anticipatory postures and are less likely to use another person's hand or body as a tool.<ref name=Volkmar/> Three- to five-year-old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form [[Attachment (psychology)|attachments]] to their primary caregivers.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev|date=2004|volume=10|issue=4|pages=221<U+2013>33|title=Early detection of core deficits in autism|author=Sigman M, Dijamco A, Gratier M, Rozga A|doi=10.1002/mrdd.20046|pmid=15666338}}</ref> They display moderately less [[Attachment in children#Secure attachment|attachment security]] than usual, although this feature disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry|date=2004|volume=45|issue=6|pages=1123<U+2013>34|title=Autism and attachment: a meta-analytic review|author=Rutgers AH, Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ, van IJzendoorn MH, van Berckelaer-Onnes IA|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.t01-1-00305.x|pmid=15257669}}</ref> Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition.<ref name=Sigman>{{cite journal |journal= Annu Rev Clin Psychol |year=2006 |volume=2 |pages=327<U+2013>55 |title= Autism from developmental and neuropsychological perspectives |author= Sigman M, Spence SJ, Wang AT |doi=10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095210 |pmid=17716073}}</ref>

Contrary to common belief, autistic children do not prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they are.<ref name=Burgess/>

There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that in children with mental retardation, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and tantrums. Dominick ''et al.'' interviewed the parents of 67 children with ASD and reported that about two-thirds of the children had periods of severe tantrums and about one third had a history of aggression, with tantrums significantly more common than in children with a history of language impairment.<ref name=Dominick/>

===Communication===
About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=J Intellect Disabil Res|date=2006|volume=50|issue=9|pages=621<U+2013>32|title=The ComFor: an instrument for the indication of augmentative communication in people with autism and intellectual disability|author=Noens I, van Berckelaer-Onnes I, Verpoorten R, van Duijn G|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2788.2006.00807.x|pmid=16901289}}</ref> Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of [[babbling]], unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and the desynchronization of vocal patterns with the caregiver. In the second and third years, autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words ([[echolalia]])<ref name=Landa/><ref name=Tager-Flusberg/> or [[Pronoun reversal|reverse pronouns]].<ref name=Kanner1943/> Autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.<ref name=Landa>{{cite journal|journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev|date=2007|volume=13|issue=1|pages=16<U+2013>25|title=Early communication development and intervention for children with autism|author=Landa R|doi=10.1002/mrdd.20134|pmid=17326115}}</ref><ref name=Tager-Flusberg>{{cite journal |journal=Pediatr Clin North Am |year=2007 |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=469<U+2013>81 |title=Language disorders: autism and other pervasive developmental disorders |author= Tager-Flusberg H, Caronna E |doi=10.1016/j.pcl.2007.02.011 |pmid=17543905}}</ref> They are more likely to have problems understanding pointing; for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object.<ref name=Volkmar/><ref name=Tager-Flusberg/>

In a pair of studies, high-functioning autistic children aged 8<U+2013>15 performed equally well, and adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.<ref name=Williams/>

===Repetitive behavior===
[[Image:Autistic-sweetiepie-boy-with-ducksinarow.jpg|thumb|A young boy with autism, and the precise line of toys he made]]
Autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) categorizes as follows.
*'''[[Stereotypy (psychiatry)|Stereotypy]]''' is apparently purposeless movement, such as hand flapping, head rolling, body rocking, or spinning a plate.
*'''[[OCD|Compulsive behavior]]''' is intended and appears to follow rules, such as arranging objects in a certain way.
*'''Sameness''' is resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted.
*'''[[Ritual#Psychology|Ritualistic behavior]]''' involves the performance of daily activities the same way each time, such as an unvarying menu or dressing ritual.
*'''Restricted behavior''' is limited in focus, interest, or activity, such as preoccupation with a single television program.
*'''[[Self-injury]]''' includes movements that injure or can injure the person, such as biting oneself. Dominick ''et al.'' reported that self-injury at some point affected about 30% of children with ASD.<ref name=Dominick/>
No single repetitive behavior seems to be specific to autism, but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=J Autism Dev Disord|date=2000|volume=30|issue=3|pages=237<U+2013>43|title=Varieties of repetitive behavior in autism: comparisons to mental retardation|author=Bodfish JW, Symons FJ, Parker DE, Lewis MH|doi=10.1023/A:1005596502855|pmid=11055459}}</ref>

===Other symptoms===
Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but that can affect the individual or the family.<ref name=Filipek>{{cite journal|author=Filipek PA, Accardo PJ, Baranek GT ''et al.''|title=The screening and diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorders|journal=J Autism Dev Disord|date=1999|volume=29|issue=6|pages=439<U+2013>84| doi=10.1023/A:1021943802493}} Erratum (2000). ''J Autism Dev Disord'' '''30''' (1): 81. {{doi|10.1023/A:1017256313409}}. PMID 10638459. This paper represents a consensus of representatives from nine professional and four parent organizations in the U.S.</ref>
A small fraction of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious [[autistic savant]]s.<ref>{{cite web |author= Treffert DA |title= Savant syndrome: an extraordinary condition<U+2014>a synopsis: past, present, future |publisher= Wisconsin Medical Society |date=2007 |url=http://www.wisconsinmedicalsociety.org/savant_syndrome/overview_of_savant_syndrome/synopsis |accessdate=2007-09-19}}</ref>

Unusual responses to [[Stimulus (physiology)|sensory stimuli]] are more common and prominent in autistic children, although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry|date=2005|volume=46|issue=12|pages=1255<U+2013>68|title=Annotation: what do we know about sensory dysfunction in autism? A critical review of the empirical evidence|author=Rogers SJ, Ozonoff S|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2005.01431.x|pmid=16313426}}</ref> The responses may be more common in children: a pair of studies found that autistic children had impaired [[Tactition|tactile perception]] while autistic adults did not. The same two studies also found that autistic individuals had more problems with complex memory and reasoning tasks such as [[Twenty Questions]]; these problems were somewhat more marked among adults.<ref name=Williams/>
Several studies have reported associated motor problems that include [[poor muscle tone]], [[Apraxia|poor motor planning]], and [[toe walking]]; ASD is not associated with severe motor disturbances.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Brain Dev|date=2007|title=Prevalence of motor impairment in autism spectrum disorders|author=Ming X, Brimacombe M, Wagner GC|doi=10.1016/j.braindev.2007.03.002|pmid=17467940}}</ref>

Atypical eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator. Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur;<ref name=Dominick/> this does not appear to result in [[malnutrition]]. Some children with autism also have [[gastrointestinal]] (GI) symptoms, but there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that autistic children have more or different GI symptoms than usual.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=J Autism Dev Disord|date=2005|volume=35|issue=6|pages=713<U+2013>27|title=Gastrointestinal factors in autistic disorder: a critical review|author=Erickson CA, Stigler KA, Corkins MR, Posey DJ, Fitzgerald JF, McDougle CJ|doi=10.1007/s10803-005-0019-4|pmid=16267642}}</ref>

[[Sleep]] problems are known to be more common in children with developmental disabilities, and there is some evidence that children with ASD are more likely to have even more sleep problems than those with other developmental disabilities; autistic children may experience problems including difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal [[Wakefulness|awakenings]], and early morning awakenings. Dominick ''et al.'' found that about two-thirds of children with ASD had a history of sleep problems.<ref name=Dominick>{{cite journal|journal=Res Dev Disabil|year=2007|volume=28|issue=2|pages=145<U+2013>62|title=Atypical behaviors in children with autism and children with a history of language impairment|author=Dominick KC, Davis NO, Lainhart J, Tager-Flusberg H, Folstein S|doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2006.02.003|pmid=16581226}}</ref>

==Causes==
{{main|Causes of autism}}
Although many genetic and environmental causes of autism have been proposed, its [[Etiology|theory of causation]] is still incomplete.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Trottier G, Srivastava L, Walker CD|title=Etiology of infantile autism: a review of recent advances in genetic and neurobiological research|journal=J Psychiatry Neurosci|date=1999|volume=24|issue=2|pages=103<U+2013>15|pmid=10212552|url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?pubmedid=10212552}}</ref> Some researchers argue this is because autism is not a single disorder, but rather a triad of core aspects (social impairment, communication difficulties, and repetitive behaviors) that have distinct causes but often co-occur.<ref name=HappeTime>{{cite journal|author=Happ<U+00E9> F, Ronald A, Plomin R|title=Time to give up on a single explanation for autism|journal=Nat Neurosci|date=2006|volume=9|issue=10|pages=1218<U+2013>20|pmid=17001340|doi=10.1038/nn1770}}</ref>

Genetic factors are the most significant cause for autism spectrum disorders. Early studies of twins estimated [[heritability]] to be more than 90%; in other words, that genetics explains more than 90% of autism cases.<ref name=Freitag/> This may be an overestimate; new twin data and models with structural genetic variation are needed.<ref name=Sykes/> When only one identical twin is autistic, the other often has learning or social disabilities.

Mutations in different sets of genes may be involved in different autistic individuals.

==Mechanism==
Despite extensive investigation, how autism occurs is not well understood. Its mechanism can be divided into two areas: the [[pathophysiology]] of brain structures and processes associated with autism, and the [[neuropsychological]] linkages between brain structures and behaviors.<ref name=Penn>{{cite journal|author=Penn HE|title=Neurobiological correlates of autism: a review of recent research|journal=Child Neuropsychol|date=2006|volume=12|issue=1|pages=57<U+2013>79|doi=10.1080/09297040500253546|pmid=16484102}}</ref>

===Pathophysiology===
[[Image:Autismbrain.jpg|thumb|Autism affects many parts of the brain.]]
Autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems, as opposed to localized physical damage.<ref name=Mueller>{{cite journal|journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev|date=2007|volume=13|issue=1|pages=85<U+2013>95|title=The study of autism as a distributed disorder|author=M<U+00FC>ller RA|doi=10.1002/mrdd.20141|pmid=17326118}}</ref> [[Neuroanatomy|Neuroanatomical]] studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autism's mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception.<ref name=Arndt/> Many major structures of the [[human brain]] have been implicated. Consistent abnormalities have been found in the development of the [[cerebral cortex]]; and in the [[cerebellum]] and related [[inferior olive]], which have a significant decrease in the number of [[Purkinje cell]]s. Brain weight and volume and head circumference tend to be greater in autistic children; the effects of these are unknown.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=J Neurosci|date=2006|volume=26|issue=26|pages=6897<U+2013>906|title=The developmental neurobiology of autism spectrum disorder|author=DiCicco-Bloom E, Lord C, Zwaigenbaum L ''et al.''|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1712-06.2006|pmid=16807320|url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/26/26/6897}}</ref> It may be due to poorly regulated growth of neurons.<ref name=Penn/>

Interactions between the [[immune system]] and the nervous system begin early during [[embryogenesis]], and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response. Several symptoms consistent with a poorly regulated immune response have been reported in autistic children. It is possible that aberrant immune activity during critical periods of neurodevelopment is part of the mechanism of some forms of ASD.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=J Leukoc Biol|date=2006|volume=80|issue=1|pages=1<U+2013>15|title=The immune response in autism: a new frontier for autism research|author=Ashwood P, Wills S, Van de Water J|doi=10.1189/jlb.1205707|pmid=16698940|url=http://www.jleukbio.org/cgi/content/full/80/1/1}}</ref> Given the lack of data in this area, it is still hard to draw conclusions about the role of immune factors in autism.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=J Autism Dev Disord|date=2002|volume=32|issue=4|pages=337<U+2013>45|title=Brief report: immune factors in autism: a critical review|author=Krause I, He XS, Gershwin ME, Shoenfeld Y|doi=10.1023/A:1016391121003|pmid=12199139}}</ref>

Several [[neurotransmitter]] abnormalities have been detected in autism, notably increased blood levels of [[serotonin]]. Whether these lead to structural or behavioral abnormalities is unclear.<ref name=Penn/>

The [[Mirror neuron|mirror neuron system]] (MNS) theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism's core features of social impairment and communication difficulties. The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal of the same species perform the same action. The MNS may contribute to an individual's understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions, intentions, and emotions.<ref>MNS and autism:

[[Image:FMRI.jpg|thumb|[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] provides some evidence for the underconnectivity theory of autism.]]
The underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning high-level neural connections and synchronization, along with an excess of low-level processes.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Cereb Cortex |year=2007 |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=951-61 |title= Functional and anatomical cortical underconnectivity in autism: evidence from an FMRI study of an executive function task and corpus callosum morphometry |author= Just MA, Cherkassky VL, Keller TA, Kana RK, Minshew NJ |doi=10.1093/cercor/bhl006 |pmid=16772313 |url=http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/17/4/951}}</ref> Evidence for this theory has been found in [[functional neuroimaging]] studies on autistic individuals<ref name=Williams>{{cite journal |author=Williams DL, Goldstein G, Minshew NJ |title=Neuropsychologic functioning in children with autism: further evidence for disordered complex information-processing |journal=Child neuropsychol |volume=12 |issue=4<U+2013>5 |pages=279<U+2013>98 |year=2006 |pmid=16911973 |doi=10.1080/09297040600681190 |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?pubmedid=16911973}}</ref> and by a [[brain wave]] study that suggested that adults with ASD have local overconnectivity in the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] and weak functional connections between the [[frontal lobe]] and the rest of the cortex.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Murias M, Webb SJ, Greenson J, Dawson G|title=Resting state cortical connectivity reflected in EEG coherence in individuals with autism|journal=Biol Psychiatry|volume=62|issue=3|pages=270<U+2013>3 |year=2007|pmid=17336944|doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.11.012}}</ref> Other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the [[Cerebral cortex#Association areas|association cortex]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Arch Neurol|date=2007|volume=64|issue=7|pages=945<U+2013>50|title=The new neurobiology of autism: cortex, connectivity, and neuronal organization|author=Minshew NJ, Williams DL|pmid=17620483}}</ref>

===Neuropsychology===
Two major categories of [[cognitive]] theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior.

The first category focuses on deficits in social cognition. Hyper-systemizing hypothesizes that autistic individuals can systematize<U+2014>that is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle internal events<U+2014>but are less effective at [[Empathy|empathizing]] by handling events generated by other agents.<ref name=hypersystem>{{cite journal|author=[[Simon Baron-Cohen|Baron-Cohen S]]|title=The hyper-systemizing, assortative mating theory of autism|journal=Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry|date=2006|volume=30|issue=5|pages=865<U+2013>72|doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.01.010|pmid=16519981}}</ref> It extends the extreme male brain theory, which hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom [[EQ SQ Theory|systemizing is better than empathizing]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Baron-Cohen S|title=The extreme male brain theory of autism|journal=Trends Cogn Sci|date=2002|volume=6|issue=6|pages=248<U+2013>54|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(02)01904-6|pmid=12039606}}</ref> This in turn is related to the earlier [[theory of mind]], which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. The theory of mind is supported by autistic children's atypical responses to the [[Sally-Anne test]] for reasoning about others' motivations,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Baron-Cohen S, Leslie AM, Frith U|title=Does the autistic child have a 'theory of mind'? |journal=Cognition |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=37<U+2013>46 |year=1985 |doi=10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 |pmid=2934210 |url=http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/~aleslie/Baron-Cohen%20Leslie%20&%20Frith%201985.pdf |format = PDF | accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref> and is mapped well from the mirror neuron system theory of autism.<ref name=Iacoboni/>

The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing. [[Executive dysfunction]] hypothesizes that autistic behavior results in part from deficits in flexibility, planning, and other forms of [[executive function]]. A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests;<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hill EL|title=Executive dysfunction in autism|journal=Trends Cogn Sci|year=2004|volume=8|issue=1|pages=26<U+2013>32|doi=10.1016/j.dr.2004.01.001|pmid=14697400}}</ref> a weakness is that executive function deficits are not found in young autistic children.<ref name=Sigman/> [[Weak central coherence theory]] hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism. One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Happ<U+00E9> F, [[Uta Frith|Frith U]]|title=The weak coherence account: detail-focused cognitive style in autism spectrum disorders|journal=J Autism Dev Disord|date=2006|volume=36|issue=1|pages=5<U+2013>25|doi=10.1007/s10803-005-0039-0|pmid=16450045}}</ref> A related theory<U+2014>enhanced perceptual functioning<U+2014>focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and [[perceptual]] operations in autistic individuals.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=J Autism Dev Disord|date=2006|volume=36|issue=1|pages=27<U+2013>43|title=Enhanced perceptual functioning in autism: an update, and eight principles of autistic perception|author=Mottron L, [[Michelle Dawson|Dawson M]], Souli<U+00E8>res I, Hubert B, Burack J|doi=10.1007/s10803-005-0040-7|pmid=16453071}}</ref> These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism.

Neither category is satisfactory on its own; social cognition theories poorly address autism's rigid and repetitive behaviors, while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties.<ref name=HappeTime/> A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful.<ref name=Rajendran>{{cite journal |journal=Dev Rev |year=2007 |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=224<U+2013>60 |title= Cognitive theories of autism |author= Rajendran G, Mitchell P |doi=10.1016/j.dr.2007.02.001}}</ref>

==Screening==
Parents are usually the first to notice unusual behaviors in their child.<ref name=Strock>{{cite paper|author=Strock, M|date=2007|title=Autism spectrum disorders (pervasive developmental disorders)|version=NIH-04-5511|publisher=National Institute of Mental Health|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/autism.cfm|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> As postponing treatment may affect long-term outcome, any of the following signs is reason to have a child evaluated by a specialist without delay:

*No single words by 16 months.
*No two-word spontaneous phrases (not including [[echolalia]]) by 24 months.
*Any loss of any language or social skills, at any age.<ref name=Filipek/>
The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] recommends that all children be [[Screening (medicine)|screened]] for ASD at the 9-, 18-, and 30-month well-child doctor visits, using autism-specific formal screening tests.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Pediatrics|date=2006|volume=118|issue=1|pages=405<U+2013>20|title=Identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders in the medical home: an algorithm for developmental surveillance and screening|author=Council on Children With Disabilities, Section on Developmental Behavioral Pediatrics, Bright Futures Steering Committee, Medical Home Initiatives for Children With Special Needs Project Advisory Committee|doi=10.1542/peds.2006-1231|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/118/1/405}} {{cite journal|journal=Pediatrics|date=2006|volume=118|issue=4|pages=1808<U+2013>9|doi=10.1542/peds.2006-2405|title=Errata|author=<nowiki>[Same authors]</nowiki>|pmid=16818591|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/118/4/1808}}</ref> In contrast, the UK National Screening Committee recommends against screening for ASD in the general population, because screening tools have not been fully validated and interventions lack sufficient evidence for effectiveness.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Autism|date=2006|volume=10|issue=1|pages=11<U+2013>35|title=Screening for autism spectrum disorders: what is the evidence?|author=Williams J, Brayne C|doi=10.1177/1362361306057876|pmid=16522708}}</ref>

Genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical. As genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge. Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results, given the complexity of autism's genetics.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Am J Med Genet C Semin Med Genet|date=2006|volume=142C|issue=1|pages=52<U+2013>7|title=Genetic counseling and ethical issues for autism|author=McMahon WM, Baty BJ, Botkin J|doi=10.1002/ajmg.c.30082|pmid=16419100}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Autism is defined in the [[DSM-IV-TR]] as exhibiting at least six symptoms total, including at least two symptoms of qualitative impairment in social interaction, at least one symptom of qualitative impairment in communication, and at least one symptom of restricted and repetitive behavior. Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language, and persistent preoccupation with parts of objects. Onset must be prior to age three years, with delays or abnormal functioning in either social interaction, language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative play. The disturbance must not be better accounted for by [[Rett syndrome]] or [[childhood disintegrative disorder]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|edition=4th ed., text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]])|author=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|date=2000|isbn=0890420254|chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 299.00 Autistic Disorder|chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> [[ICD-10]] uses essentially the same definition.<ref name=ICD-10-F84.0>{{cite book|chapterurl=http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf80.htm+f840|date=2006|accessdate=2007-06-25|title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|edition=10th ed. ([[ICD-10]])|author=[[World Health Organization]]|chapter=F84. Pervasive developmental disorders}}</ref>

Several diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the [[Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised]] (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the [[Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule]] (ADOS) uses observation and interaction with the child. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children.<ref name=Volkmar/>

A [[pediatrician]] commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated medical conditions. A [[differential diagnosis]] for ASD at this stage might also consider [[mental retardation]], [[hearing impairment]], and a [[specific language disorder]]<ref name=Dover/> such as [[Landau-Kleffner syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Dev Med Child Neurol |year=2000 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=349<U+2013>53 |title= Autistic regression and Landau-Kleffner syndrome: progress or confusion? |author= Mantovani JF |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8749.2000.tb00104.x |pmid=10855658}}</ref> In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice.<ref name=Dover>{{cite journal|journal=Arch Dis Child|date=2007|volume=92|issue=6|pages=540<U+2013>5|title=How to diagnose autism|author=Dover CJ, Le Couteur A|doi=10.1136/adc.2005.086280|pmid=17515625}}</ref> ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months,<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Arch Gen Psychiatry|date=2007|volume=64|issue=7|pages=853<U+2013>64|title=Social and communication development in toddlers with early and later diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders|author=Landa RJ, Holman KC, Garrett-Mayer E|pmid=17606819}}</ref> but a 2006 U.S. study found the average age of first evaluation by a qualified professional was 48 months and of formal ASD diagnosis was 61 months, reflecting an average 13-month delay, all far above recommendations.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=J Dev Behav Pediatr|date=2006|volume=27|issue=2 Suppl|pages=S79<U+2013>87|title=Examination of the time between first evaluation and first autism spectrum diagnosis in a population-based sample|author=Wiggins LD, Baio J, Rice C|pmid=16685189}}</ref>

Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Shattuck PT, Grosse SD|title=Issues related to the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders|journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev|date=2007|volume=13|issue=2|pages=129<U+2013>35|doi=10.1002/mrdd.20143|pmid=17563895}}</ref> It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the [[visually impaired]], partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Visual impairment and autism: current questions and future research|author=Cass H|journal=Autism|date=1998|volume=2|issue=2|pages=117<U+2013>38|doi=10.1177/1362361398022002}}</ref>

The symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood but are occasionally missed. Adults may seek retrospective diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=The National Autistic Society|title=Why get a diagnosis as an adult?|date=2005|url=http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?a=8018|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref>

{{main|Autism therapies}}

[[Autism (incidence)|Autism's incidence]], despite its advantages for assessing risk, is less useful in autism epidemiology, as the disorder starts long before it is diagnosed, and the gap between initiation and diagnosis is influenced by many factors unrelated to risk. Attention is focused mostly on whether prevalence is increasing with time. Earlier prevalence estimates were lower, centering at about 0.5 per 1,000 for autism during the 1960s and 1970s and about 1 per 1,000 in the 1980s, as opposed to today's 1<U+2013>2 per 1,000.<ref name=Newschaffer/>

The [[New Latin]] word ''autismus'' (English translation ''autism'') was coined by the [[Swiss]] psychiatrist [[Eugen Bleuler]] in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of [[schizophrenia]]. He derived it from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''autos'' (<U+03B1><U+1F50><U+03C4><U+03CC><U+03C2>, meaning ''self''), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to "autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance."<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kuhn R; tr.

[[Image:kanner kl2.jpg|thumb|[[Leo Kanner]] introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in 1943.]]
The word ''autism'' took its modern sense in 1943 when [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] reported 11 children with striking behavioral similarities and introduced the label ''early infantile autism''.<ref name=Kanner1943>{{cite journal|author=[[Leo Kanner|Kanner L]]|title=Autistic disturbances of affective contact|journal=Nerv Child|volume=2|pages=217<U+2013>50|date=1943}}</ref> He suggested ''autism'' to describe the children's lack of interest in other people. Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably "autistic aloneness" and "insistence on sameness", are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.<ref name=HappeTime/> About the same time, the [[Vienna|Viennese]] pediatrician [[Hans Asperger]] described a similar form of ASD now known as [[Asperger's]], though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate syndrome until 1981.<ref name=Wolff/>

Kanner's reuse of ''autism'' led to decades of confused terminology like "infantile schizophrenia", and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation during the mid-1900s led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to "[[refrigerator mother]]s". Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong, distinguishing it from mental retardation and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders, and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Can J Psychiatry|date=2003|volume=48|issue=8|pages=503<U+2013>5|title=Modern views of autism|author=Fombonne E|pmid=14574825|url=http://ww1.cpa-apc.org:8080/Publications/Archives/CJP/2003/september/guesteditorial.asp}}</ref> As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions.<ref>{{cite book |chapter= Genetic epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders |author= [[Peter Szatmari|Szatmari P]], Jones MB |pages=157<U+2013>78 |title= Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders |edition = 2nd ed |editor= Volkmar FR |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |isbn=0521549574}}</ref> The rise of parent organizations and the [[Social stigma|destigmatization]] of childhood ASD have deeply affected how we view ASD, its boundaries, and its treatments.<ref name=Wolff/> The [[Internet]] has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely.<ref>{{cite news|author=Biever C|title=Web removes social barriers for those with autism|work=New Scientist|issue=2610|date=[[2007-06-27]]|url=http://www.newscientisttech.com/channel/tech/mg19426106.100-web-removes-social-barriers-for-those-with-autism.html|accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref> [[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism]] have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that autism is simply another way of being.<ref name=Rajendran/><ref name=Gal>{{cite news|author=Gal L|title=Who says autism's a disease?|work=Haaretz|date=[[2007-06-28]]|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/876283.html|accessdate=2007-07-16}}</ref>
