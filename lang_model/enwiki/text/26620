'''Nine Inch Nails''' (abbreviated as '''NI<!--Please do not use <U+0418>; it is the Cyrillic letter I -->N''') is an [[industrial rock]] band, founded [[1988 in music|in 1988]] by [[Trent Reznor]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. As its main [[Producer (music)|producer]], singer, songwriter, and instrumentalist, Reznor is the only official member of Nine Inch Nails and remains solely responsible for its musical direction.<ref name = "AMG" /> NIN's music straddles a wide range of genres, while retaining a characteristically intense sound using [[electronic instruments]] and processing. After recording a new album, Reznor usually assembles [[Nine Inch Nails live performances|a live band]] to perform with him; this live component is a separate entity from Nine Inch Nails in the recording studio.<ref name="Industrial Introspection" /><ref name="Wigney" /> On stage, NIN often employs spectacular visual elements to accompany its performances, which frequently culminate with the band [[instrument destruction|destroying musical instruments]].<ref name="Reimink" />

[[Underground music]] audiences warmly received Nine Inch Nails in its early years. The band produced several highly influential records in the 1990s that achieved widespread popularity: many Nine Inch Nails songs became radio hits,<ref name = "BillboardHistory" /> two NIN recordings won [[Grammy Award]]s, and the band has sold over 20 million albums worldwide,<ref name="Yahoo!Court" /> with 10.5 million sales certified in the [[United States]] alone.<ref name="RIAAbestsellers" /> In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed Nine Inch Nails at 94 on their list of the 100 greatest music artists of all time.<ref name="Bowie" /> In spite of this acclaim, the band has had several feuds with the corporate side of the recording industry. Trent Reznor announced in 2007 that Nine Inch Nails would proceed independently of record labels.<ref name="BBFreeAgent" />

In the past, NI<!--Please do not use <U+0418> -->N released major studio albums infrequently; remixes and live albums bridged these gaps in the band's catalog. Reznor cites his personal issues as the cause of these delays, and his songs often confront dark explorations of the self.<ref name="SMH" /> The most recent Nine Inch Nails album, ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]'', is an exception to the usually introspective nature of Reznor's songwriting and the long gestation between major releases.

===Early years===
[[Image:Nine Inch Nails Logo.svg|The NIN logo designed by Reznor and Gary Talpas|thumb|right|150px]]
Initial ambitions for Nine Inch Nails in 1988 were to release one [[12-inch single]] on a small European label.<ref name= "AP90">{{cite journal |title= Getting Down in It |date= March 1990 |journal= [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] |issue= 27}}</ref> Reznor was employed at that time as an assistant engineer and janitor at [[Midtown Recording|Right Track Studios]] in Cleveland,<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |author= Huey, Steve |url= http://wm04.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:jxkcikv6bbf9~T10 |title= Nine Inch Nails |accessdate= 2006-11-24 |publisher= [[All Music Guide]]}}</ref> and asked studio owner Bart Koster for permission to record some [[Demo (music)|demos]] of his own songs for free during unused studio time. Koster agreed, remarking that it cost him "just a little wear on [his] tape heads".<ref>{{cite journal  |title= The music of rage |journal= [[People (magazine)|People]] |volume=43 |issue=5 |last=Dougherty |first= Steve |coauthors=Bryan Alexander, Tom Nugent, John Hannah |date= [[1995-02-06]] |pages=105<U+2013>107}}</ref> While assembling these, the earliest NIN recordings, Reznor was unable to find a band that could articulate his songs as he wanted. Instead, inspired by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], he played all the instruments except drums himself.<ref>{{cite journal |title= The Truth About Trent |journal=Option |last=Fine |first=Jason |date=July/August 1994}}</ref> This role remains Reznor's on most of the band's studio recordings, though he has occasionally involved other musicians and assistants. Several labels responded favorably to the demo material, and Reznor signed with [[TVT Records]].<ref name= "AMG" /> Nine selections from the Right Track demos were unofficially released in 1994 as ''[[Purest Feeling]]''; many of these songs would appear in revised form on ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'' in 1989.

Several rumors have persisted about the origins of the name "Nine Inch Nails", one being that Reznor chose to reference the story of Jesus' crucifixion with nine inch spikes.<ref name = "Shock">{{cite book |first= Greg |last= Rule |title= Electro Shock!: Groundbreakers of Synth Music |publisher= Backbeat Books |year= 1999 |id= ISBN 0-8793-0582-7}}</ref> [[Chuck Klosterman]] surmised that Reznor was inspired by the sight of nine inch fingernails on [[Freddy Krueger]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.spin.com/features/magazine/columns/chuck_klosterman/2006/03/0603_chuck/ |title= Arriving late to the Nine Inch Nails party |last= Klosterman |first= Chuck |authorlink= Chuck Klosterman |publisher = [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date= March 1992 |accessdate = 2006-11-01}}</ref> Reznor maintains that he coined the name because it "abbreviated easily", rather than for "any literal meaning".<ref name = "Axcess">{{cite journal |title= Talking about Nothing with Trent Reznor |journal= Axcess |volume= 2 |date= 1994}}</ref> Reznor and Gary Talpas designed the Nine Inch Nails logo, which consists of the letters "NIN" set inside a border with the second "N" reversed. The logo first appeared on NIN's debut, "[[Down in It]]", and was inspired by [[Tibor Kalman]]'s typography on the [[Talking Heads]] album ''[[Remain in Light]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nin.com/access/7_21_04/questions5.gif |title= Response from Trent |date= [[2004-07-21]] |last= Reznor |first=Trent |authorlink = Trent Reznor |publisher= [http://nin.com/ The official NIN website] |accessdate= 2006-10-22}}</ref> Talpas, a native of Cleveland, would continue to design NIN packaging art until 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url=

===''Pretty Hate Machine''===
{{main|Pretty Hate Machine}}
Written, arranged, and performed by Trent Reznor, NIN's first album '''''Pretty Hate Machine''''' debuted in 1989. It marked Reznor's first collaboration with [[Adrian Sherwood]] (who produced the lead single "Down in It" in [[London, England]] without having met Reznor face-to-face)<ref name = "AP90" /> and [[Flood (producer)|Mark "Flood" Ellis]]. Flood's production would appear on each major Nine Inch Nails release until 1994, and Sherwood has done remixes for the band as recently as 2000. Reznor and his co-producers expanded upon the ''Purest Feeling'' demos, and added future singles "[[Head Like a Hole]]" and "[[Sin (Nine Inch Nails song)|Sin]]". ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s [[Michael Azerrad]] described the album as "industrial-strength noise over a pop framework" and "harrowing but catchy music";<ref name="RS Azerrad">{{cite journal |last= Azerrad |first= Michael |authorlink= Michael Azerrad |title= Nine Inch Nails |journal= [[Rolling Stone]] |date= 1990}}</ref> Reznor proclaimed this combination "a sincere statement" of "what was in [his] head at the time".<ref>{{cite journal |author= Martin, Steve |title= Nine Inch Nails |journal= [[Thrasher (magazine)|Thrasher]] |date= 1990}}</ref> After spending 113 weeks on the [[Billboard 200]],<ref name="PHM 200">{{cite web |title= The Billboard 200 - Pretty Hate Machine |publisher= Billboard |url= http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/chart_display.jsp?cfi=305&cfgn=Albums&cfn=The+Billboard+200&ci=3012164&cdi=6609861&cid=04%2F18%2F1992   |accessdate= 2007-10-08}}</ref> ''Pretty Hate Machine'' became one of the first [[Indie (music)|independently released]] records to attain [[RIAA certification|platinum certification]].<ref name="AMG" /> [[MTV]] aired videos for "Down in It" and "Head Like a Hole", but an explicit video for "Sin" was only released on the 1997 home video ''[[Closure (Nine Inch Nails VHS)|Closure]]''.

In 1988, Reznor assembled a live band and toured North America as an opening act for [[Skinny Puppy]], later supporting [[alternative rock]] artists such as [[Peter Murphy (musician)|Peter Murphy]] and [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]].<ref name="AMG" /> On the latter tours, Reznor began smashing his equipment while on stage; ''Rockbeat'' interviewer Mike Gitter attributed NIN's early success in front of rock oriented audiences to this aggressive attitude.<ref name = "Rockbeat">{{cite journal |title= The man behind the machine |author= Gitter, Mike |journal= Rockbeat |date= 1992}}</ref> Nine Inch Nails then embarked on a world tour that continued through the first [[Lollapalooza]] festival in 1991, where the band "stole the show" from headliners [[Jane's Addiction]] despite numerous equipment problems.<ref name = "Huxley">{{cite book |last= Huxley |first= Martin |title= Nine Inch Nails: Self Destruct |year= 1997 |month= September |publisher= St. Martin's Griffin |id= ISBN 0-3121-5612-X}}</ref> After a disastrous European reception opening for [[Guns N' Roses]], NIN returned to America amid pressure from TVT to produce a more commercial follow-up to ''Pretty Hate Machine''. In response, Reznor secretly began recording under various pseudonyms to avoid record company interference.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Nine Inch Nails |journal= [[Musician (magazine)|Musician]] |date= March 1994}}</ref>

===''Broken''===
{{main|Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)}}
[[Image:Happiness in Slavery video.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Bob Flanagan]] being tortured in the music video for "[[Happiness in Slavery]]"]]
In his liner notes, Trent Reznor credits the 1991 Nine Inch Nails touring band as an influence on the 1992 '''''Broken''''' [[Extended Play|EP]]'s six songs and two bonus tracks. Reznor characterized the EP as a guitar-based "blast of destruction", which was intentionally "a lot harder[...] than ''Pretty Hate Machine''".<ref name="Shock" /> Songs from ''Broken'' have garnered NIN their only two Grammy Awards: a performance of the EP's first single "[[Happiness in Slavery]]" from [[Woodstock '94]],<ref name = "AwardsDatabase" /> and the second single "[[Wish (song)|Wish]]".<ref name="AwardsDatabase" />

[[Peter Christopherson|Peter "Sleazy" Christopherson]] of the bands [[Coil (band)|Coil]] and [[Throbbing Gristle]] directed a performance video for "Wish",<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.9inchnails.com/gallery/wish.php |title= Wish |publisher= Painful Convictions |date= 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-07}}</ref> but the EP's most infamous video accompanied the song "Happiness in Slavery". The video was almost universally banned for its graphic depiction of [[performance art]]ist [[Bob Flanagan]] disrobing in front of the camera and lying on a machine that pleasures, tortures, then kills him.<ref name="Stone94">{{cite journal |title= Love it to death |last=Gold |first=Jonathan |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |issue= 690 |pages= 50 |date=[[September 8]], [[1994]]}}</ref> A third video for "Pinion", partially incorporated into MTV's ''Alternative Nation'' opening sequence, showed a toilet that apparently flushes into the mouth of an individual in bondage.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.9inchnails.com/gallery/pinion.php |title= Pinion |publisher= Painful Convictions |date= 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-07}}</ref> Reznor and Christopherson compiled these three clips along with videos for "Help Me I Am In Hell" and "Gave Up" into a longform music video also called ''[[Broken (film)|Broken]]''. "Broken" depicts the murder of a young man who is kidnapped and tortured while forced to watch the videos. This footage was never officially released, but instead appeared covertly among tape trading circles.<ref name="Stone94" />

A separate performance video for "Gave Up" featuring [[Richard Patrick]] and [[Marilyn Manson (person)|Marilyn Manson]] was filmed at [[10050 Cielo Drive]] (then renamed "Le Pig studios" by Reznor), site of the [[Charles Manson#Tate murders|Tate murders]];<ref name = "AMG" /> a live recording of "Wish" was also filmed, and both videos appeared on the ''Closure'' compilation in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.9inchnails.com/gallery/gave-up.php |title= Gave Up |publisher= Painful Convictions |date= 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-07}}</ref> ''Broken'' was followed by the remix EP ''[[Fixed (EP)|Fixed]]'' in late 1992. Rather than tour in support of the new material, Reznor began living and recording full-time at Le Pig, working on a follow-up free of restrictions from his record label. ''The Downward Spiral'' was the result of this creative environment.

===''The Downward Spiral''===
{{main|The Downward Spiral}}
[[Image:Closer Monkey.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An image from the music video for "[[Closer to God|Closer"]]]]
Nine Inch Nails' second full-length album, '''''The Downward Spiral''''', entered the Billboard 200 in 1994 at number two,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cleveland.com/kidsnewsday/content.ssf?/homegrown/index.ssf?/homegrown/more/reznor/timeline.html |title= Trent Reznor: Timeline |publisher= Cleveland.com |accessdate= 2006-12-18}}</ref> and it remains the highest-selling NIN release in the United States.<ref name="RIAA.com" /> Inspired by late-1970s rock albums ''[[Low (album)|Low]]'' and ''[[The Wall (album)|The Wall]]'', ''The Downward Spiral'' features a wide range of textures and moods to illustrate the mental progress of a central character.<ref name = "Details">{{cite journal |title= The art of darkness |last= Heath |first= Chris | authorlink = Chris Heath |journal= [[Details (magazine)|Details]] |date= April 1995}}</ref>  In his last work with the band to date, Flood once again co-produced several tracks; his longtime collaborator [[Alan Moulder]] [[mix engineer|mixed]] most of ''The Downward Spiral'' and took on more extensive production duties for subsequent NIN releases.

The album spawned two singles: "[[March of the Pigs]]" and "[[Closer to God|Closer]]"; "[[Hurt (song)|Hurt]]" and "Piggy" were issued to radio without a commercial single release. The music video for "Closer", directed by [[Mark Romanek]], received frequent rotation on MTV after the network made edits to it.<ref name="Closer video">{{cite web |title= Nine Inch Nails: Closure (VHS) |publisher= DeepFocus.com |url= http://www.deep-focus.com/flicker/closure.html |accessdate= 2007-08-26}}</ref>  A radio edit that partially mutes the song's explicit lyrics also received extensive airtime.<ref name= "BillboardHistory" /> "Hurt" enjoyed renewed success when it was [[Cover version|covered]] by [[Johnny Cash]] in 2002, and Reznor has stated that hearing Cash's cover revitalized his interest in writing music.<ref>{{cite book |last= DeCurtis |first= Anthony |authorlink= Anthony DeCurtis |title= In Other Words |chapter= Trent Reznor on 'Hurt' |publisher= Hal Leonard |origyear= 2005 |id= ISBN 0-6340-6655-2}}</ref>  The ''Closure'' video documented highlights from NIN's ''Self Destruct'' tour, including full live videos of "Eraser", "Hurt" and a [[Long take|one-take]] "March of the Pigs" clip made for MTV. 

Critical response to ''The Downward Spiral'' has generally been favorable: in 2005 the album was ranked 25th in [[Spin (magazine)|''Spin'''s]] list of the "100 Greatest Albums, 1985<U+2013>2005",<ref name="Spin100">{{cite journal |year= 2005 |month= June |title= 100 Greatest Albums, 1985<U+2013>2005 |journal= [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |issue= June 2005}}</ref> and in 2003 ''Rolling Stone'' ranked the album number 200 on their "[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 greatest albums of all time]]" list.<ref name="200great500">{{cite web |title= The RS 500 Greatest Albums of All Time |publisher= [[Rolling Stone]] |date= [[2003-11-18]] |url= http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6599404/200_the_downward_spiral |accessdate= 2007-08-26}}</ref> After ''The Downward Spiral'', Reznor produced a remix album entitled ''[[Further Down the Spiral]]'', the only non-major NIN release to be certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] in the United States.<ref name="RIAA.com" /> It featured contributions from electronic musician [[Aphex Twin]], producer [[Rick Rubin]], and former [[Jane's Addiction]] guitarist [[Dave Navarro]]. Two versions of ''Further Down the Spiral'' were released in 1995, both featuring exclusive content.

===''The Fragile''===
{{main|The Fragile}}
Five years elapsed between ''The Downward Spiral'' and NIN's next major album, '''''The Fragile''''', which arrived as a [[double CD]] in September 1999.<ref name= "Bleak" /> On the heels of NIN's previous successes, media anticipation surrounded ''The Fragile'' more than a year before its arrival,<ref>{{cite news |title= NIN Album on Horizon |work= Daily News Online |date= August 1998}}</ref> when it was already described as "oft-delayed".<ref>{{cite journal |title= Nine Inch Nails - Ball of confusion |journal = [[Hit Parader]] |date= September 1998 |last= Hargrove |first= Brandon}}.</ref> When the album was finally released, it debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 228,000 copies in one week and receiving favorable reviews.<ref name= "Bleak"/> ''Spin'' hailed ''The Fragile'' as the "album of the year", and several songs from it were regular features on alternative rock radio stations.<ref>{{cite news |title= Rock radio pumps up volume |author = Kaufman, Gil |work = SonicNet News |date=[[1999-12-02]] |accessdate= 2006-10-28}}</ref> However, the album slipped out of the Billboard Top 10 only a week after its release, and Reznor was forced to pay for the subsequent North American tour out of his own pocket.<ref name="Bleak">{{cite journal | title= Rock's outlook bleak, but this Nail won't bend | author= Soeder, John |journal = Cleveland.com |date=[[2000-04-09]]}}</ref>

According to Reznor, ''The Fragile'' was conceived by making "songwriting and arranging and production and sound design [...] the same thing. A song would start with a drum loop or a visual and eventually a song would emerge out of it and that was the song."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mtv.com/bands/n/nin/news_feature_050509/index2.jhtml |title= The upward spiral |publisher= [[MTV]] |author= Moss, Corey |date= May 2005 |accessdate= 2006-12-18}}</ref> Canadian rock producer [[Bob Ezrin]] was consulted on the album's track listing; the liner notes state that he "provided final continuity and flow."

Before the album's release, the song "[[Starfuckers, Inc.]]" provoked media speculation about whom Reznor had intended its acerbic lyrics to satirize.<ref>{{cite news |title= Provocative, pounding new NIN songs leaked to radio |author = Kaufman, Gil |work = SonicNet News |date= [[1999-07-14]] |accessdate= 2006-10-28}}.</ref> [[Cinesexuality]] critic Patricia MacCormack interprets the song as a "scathing attack on the alternative music scene", particularly Reznor's former friend and prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9> [[Marilyn Manson (person)|Marilyn Manson]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.popmatters.com/music/videos/n/nin-starfuckers.shtml |title=All the fun of the (not so) fair |last= MacCormack |first= Patricia |publisher=[[PopMatters]] |accessdate= 2007-08-26}}</ref> The two artists put aside their differences when Manson co-directed and appeared in the song's music video, retitled "Starsuckers, Inc." and performed on stage with NIN at [[Madison Square Garden]] in 2000. Nine Inch Nails released three commercial singles from the album in different territories: "[[The Day the World Went Away]]" in North America; "[[We're in This Together]]" in the [[EU]] and Japan (on three separate discs); and an EP with "[[Into the Void (Nine Inch Nails song)|Into the Void]]" as its lead track in Australia. MTV aired videos for the latter two tracks, as well as "Starsuckers, Inc."

Reznor followed ''The Fragile'' with another remix album, ''[[Things Falling Apart]]'', released after the 2000 ''Fragility'' tour, which itself was recorded and released on CD, DVD, and VHS in 2002 as ''[[And All that Could Have Been]]''. A deluxe edition of the live CD came with the companion disc ''[[Still (Nine Inch Nails album)|Still]]'', featuring stripped-down re-interpretations of songs from the band's entire career along with several new pieces of music.

Nine Inch Nails' latest studio album, '''''Year Zero''''', was released only two years after ''With Teeth''. With its lyrics written from the perspective of multiple fictitious characters, Reznor described ''Year Zero'' as a [[concept album]] criticizing the [[United States government]]'s current policies and how they will impact the world 15 years in the future.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gigwise.com/news.asp?contentid=29753 |title=Trent Reznor Blasts the American Government |publisher=Gigwise.com |first=Jason |last=Gregory |date=[[2007-03-26]] |accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref> Critical response to the album was generally favorable, with an average rating of 76% on [[MetaCritic]].

== Influence ==
Nine Inch Nails has influenced many newer artists, which according to Reznor range from "generic imitations" dating from NIN's initial success to younger bands echoing his style in a "truer, less imitative way".<ref>{{cite journal |title= Geoff Rickly interviews Trent Reznor |last= Rickly |first= Geoff |authorlink= Geoff Rickly |journal= [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] |date= [[2004-06-26]]}}</ref> Following the release of ''The Downward Spiral'', mainstream artists began to take notice of Nine Inch Nails' influence: David Bowie compared NIN's impact to that of [[The Velvet Underground]].<ref name= "Bowie">{{cite journal |title= Nine Inch Nails |last= Bowie |first= David |authorlink=David Bowie |journal= [[Rolling Stone]] |issue=972 |date=[[2005-04-21]] |url = http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7250012/94_nine_inch_nails |accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref> In 1997, Reznor appeared in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's list of the year's most influential people, and ''Spin'' magazine described him as "the most vital artist in music".<ref name="Time">{{cite journal |title= Time's 25 most influential Americans |journal= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= [[1997-04-21]] |volume=149 |issue=16 |pages= 66}}</ref> The [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] certified sales for 10.5 million units of the band's albums in the United States,<ref name="RIAAbestsellers">{{cite web |url= http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=3&table=tblTopArt&action=|title= Best Sellers: Gold & Platinum Top Artists |publisher= [[Recording Industry Association of America]] |date= [[2006-07-31]] |accessdate= 2007-02-05}}</ref> which accounts for roughly half of the band's reported sales worldwide.<ref name="Yahoo!Court">{{cite web | last = Amter | first = Charlie | title = Reznor Bares Teeth in Court | publisher = ''[[Yahoo!

== Musical characteristics ==
{{Inline audio|section}}
[[Image:NineInchNails.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Nine Inch Nails live on tour in 2005]]
[[All Music Guide]]'s Steve Huey states that "Nine Inch Nails were the most popular [[Industrial music|industrial]] group ever and were largely responsible for bringing the music to a mass audience."<ref name="AMG" /> Reznor has never referred to his own work as industrial music, but admits to borrowing techniques from such early industrial bands as [[Throbbing Gristle]] and [[Test Dept.]]<ref name="Axcess" /> Despite the disparity between those artists initially operating under the term "industrial" and Nine Inch Nails, it has become common in journalistic descriptions of Reznor's body of work to describe it as such. In actuality, the band's output has covered a wide range of genres: though Reznor acknowledged in ''Spin'' magazine that "Down in It" was influenced by early [[Skinny Puppy]], particularly their song "[[Dig It (single)|Dig It]]", other songs from ''Pretty Hate Machine'' were described in the same interview as [[synth-pop]].<ref>{{cite journal |title= Sympathy for the devil |journal= [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date= March 1996}}</ref> Reviewing ''The Fragile'', critic Steve Cooper noted that the album juxtaposes widely varied genres, such as solo piano in "The Frail" and [[drum and bass]] elements in "Starfuckers, Inc."<ref>{{cite web |title= NIN's new effort threads the line between beauty and destruction |first= Steve |last= Cooper |publisher= The Cavalier Daily |url= http://www.cavalierdaily.com/CVArticle.asp?ID=768&pid=469 |date= [[1999-09-24]] |accessdate= 2007-08-26}}</ref>

Certain techniques and styles can be found throughout NIN's catalog. Songs such as "Wish" ({{audio-nohelp|Wish.ogg|sample}}) and "The Day the World Went Away" ({{audio-nohelp|TDtWWA.ogg|sample}}) exhibit changes in [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], changing from quiet to loud and back again, and end with an abrupt stop. Reznor's singing follows a similar pattern, frequently moving from whispers to screams. The band's music also occasionally features complex [[time signatures]], notably in "The Collector", from ''With Teeth'',<ref name = "PopMatters review">{{cite web |url= http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/n/nineinchnails-withteeth.shtml |title= "Nine Inch Nails: With Teeth" |publisher= [http://www.popmatters.com/ PopMatters] |author= Schiller, Mike |date= [[2005-05-18]] |accessdate= 2006-12-20}}</ref> and concert favourite "March of the Pigs".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20050405/ai_n13498487 |title= Arts reviews: Nine Inch Nails |work= [[The Independent]] |date=[[2005-04-05]] |author= Nash, Rob |accessdate= 2006-12-20}}  Archived at [http://www.findarticles.com/ FindArticles.com].</ref> Reznor also uses [[Noise (audio)|noise]] and distortion in his song arrangements, and incorporates [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] with [[chromatic]] melody and/or harmony. These techniques are all used in the song "Hurt" ({{audio-nohelp|Hurt.ogg|sample}}), which features a highly dissonant [[tritone]] played on guitar during the verses, a B5#11, emphasized when Reznor sings the [[eleventh]] note on the word "I" every time the B/F [[Dyad (music)|dyad]] is played.<ref>{{cite book |author= Reynolds, Tom |title= I Hate Myself and I Want to Die |pages= 227 |id= ISBN 978-1860746284 |date= [[2005-06-13]] |publisher= Sanctuary Publishing}}</ref> "Closer" ({{audio-nohelp|Closer.ogg|sample}}) concludes with a chromatic piano [[Motif (music)|motif]]: the same melody that recurs on the title track of ''The Downward Spiral''.<ref name = "PopMatters review" /> On ''The Fragile'', Reznor revisits this technique of repeating a motif multiple times throughout different songs, either on a different musical instrument, with a transposed harmony, or in an altered tempo.<ref>{{cite web |title= The Fragile |publisher= Lollipop Online |url=http://www.lollipop.com/archive_temp.php3?content=issue50/50-04a-13.php3 |date= May 2000 |author= Marburger, Lex |accessdate= 2006-12-20}}</ref>

==Band members==
{{main|Nine Inch Nails live performances}}
Nine Inch Nails as a live band is generally understood to be a separate entity from its recording studio-based component.<ref name="Industrial Introspection">{{cite web |url= http://gopher.well.sf.ca.us:70/0/Publications/authors/Gareth_Branwyn/gar4.cv |title= Industrial Introspection |last= Branwyn |first= Gareth |authorlink= Gareth Branwyn |publisher= ''[[Mondo 2000]]'' '''5''' |date= [[1991-06-19]] |accessdate= 2007-02-10}} Archived at [[WELL]].</ref><ref name="Wigney">{{cite web | url = http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/N/Nine_Inch_Nails/2006/03/03/1471299-sun.html |title= NIN keyboardist having a blast |author= Allan Wigney |publisher= ''[[Ottawa Sun]]'' |date= [[2006-03-03]] |accessdate= 2007-02-10}} Archived at [[Canadian Online Explorer]].</ref> Occasionally, past band members are invited to participate in the process, but when not directly involved with recording new material, Nine Inch Nails' lineup tends to change drastically between major tours. Aside from Trent Reznor remaining on lead vocals and guitar, nothing about the live band has remained constant since its inception. Reznor cited the long gestation period between studio albums as part of the reason for these frequent personnel changes.<ref>{{cite episode |title= Trent Reznor talks to Ian Camfield |network= [[Xfm London]] |airdate=2005-07-22}}</ref> Beginning in late 2005, the live band featured [[Aaron North]] on guitar, [[Jeordie White]] on bass guitar, [[Alessandro Cortini]] on keyboards, and [[Josh Freese]] on drums, though all occasionally performed with different instruments.<ref name = "Reimink">{{cite news |author=Reimink, Troy |title= Changes in songs, lineup keep Nails sharp |work= [[Grand Rapids Press]] |pages= D1 |date= [[2007-03-05]]}}</ref> This lineup toured Europe, Asia, Australia, and America through 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nin.com/tour/index.html |title= Performance 2007 tour dates |date= [[2006-02-03]] |accessdate = 2006-02-07}}</ref> Trent Reznor reported that he would disband the "rock band configuration" of his touring lineup after their concert in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] on [[September 18]], [[2007]], and would explore other means to perform Nine Inch Nails material on subsequent tours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://starbulletin.com/2007/09/14/features/story05.html |title=Reznor's edge cuts NIN's bleak outlook |last=Chun |first=Gary |publisher=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |date=[[2007-09-14]] |accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref>

==Corporate entanglements==

Trent Reznor is an outspoken critic of the music industry, particularly corporate influence on his artistic freedom. As a result, Nine Inch Nails has clashed with several corporations, culminating in a decision to proceed as a free agent without any recording label contracts.

* In the early 1990s, Nine Inch Nails was involved in a much-publicized feud with TVT Records, the first record label to sign the band. Reznor objected to the label's attempted interference with his intellectual property.<ref name = "Shock" /> Ultimately, they entered into a joint venture with Interscope Records in which Reznor forfeited a portion of his publishing rights to TVT Music in exchange for the freedom of having his own [[Nothing Records]] imprint.<ref name = "Huxley" /> In 2005, Reznor sued his former friend and manager [[John Malm, Jr.]], co-founder of Nothing, for breach of contract and fiduciary duty.<ref>{{cite journal |title= NIN's Reznor: I was duped by my manager |date= [[2005-05-17]] |journal= [[Associated Press]]}} </ref> Their relationship was formally severed in a New York courtroom, with damages awarded to Reznor in excess of three million US dollars.<ref name = "E! Online">{{cite web |url= http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=0d53d346-74a1-496c-a624-3ce5e8054ae4 |title= Reznor bails on MTV, nails manager |author= Amter, Charlie |publisher= [[E! Online]] |date= [[2005-05-27]] |accessdate= 2006-11-28}}</ref>

* At the behest of [[Prudential Financial|Prudential Securities]] bankruptcy proceedings, TVT put the rights to Reznor's recordings for the label on auction in 2005. This offer included the whole TVT catalog, including ''Pretty Hate Machine'' and a percentage of royalties from Reznor's song publishing company, Leaving Hope Music/TVT Music. [[Rykodisc]], who did not win the auction but were able to license the rights from Prudential, re-issued the out-of-print ''Pretty Hate Machine'' CD on [[November 22]], [[2005]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://theninhotline.net/news/archives/backissue/05/10#1130439320 |title= Rykodisk to reissue pretty hate machine *updated* |publisher=The NIN Hotline |date= [[2005-10-27]] |accessdate= 2006-11-28}}</ref> Ryko also reissued the "Head Like a Hole" CD and a vinyl edition of ''Pretty Hate Machine'' on [[January 31]], [[2006]]. They considered releasing a deluxe edition, just as Interscope had done for ''The Downward Spiral''; however, Reznor declined to produce it for them without payment.<ref name = "Toronto Sun">{{cite news |url= http://www.torontosun.com/Entertainment/Music/2005/11/08/1297497-sun.html |title= Reznor grits his teeth |author= Ladouceur, Liisa |work= [[The Toronto Sun]] |date= [[2005-11-08]] |accessdate= 2006-10-22}}</ref>

* Nine Inch Nails was scheduled to perform at the 2005 [[MTV Movie Awards]], but dropped themselves from the show due to a disagreement with the network over the use of an unaltered image of [[George W. Bush]] as a backdrop to the band's performance of "[[The Hand that Feeds]]". Soon afterwards, Reznor wrote on the official NIN website: "apparently, the image of our president is as offensive to MTV as it is to me".<ref name= "E! Online" /> MTV replied that they respected Reznor's point of view, but were "uncomfortable" with the performance being "built around partisan political statements". A performance by the [[Foo Fighters]] replaced NIN's time slot on the show.<ref name="MTV Awards">{{cite web |url= http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1503082/story.jhtml |last= Montgomery |first= James |title= Nine Inch Nails Drop Out Of MTV Movie Awards Over Bush Dispute |publisher= [[MTV]] |date= [[2005-05-27]] |accessdate= 2007-08-20}}</ref>

* In [[2006]], after being alerted by a fan website, Reznor issued a [[cease and desist]] to [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] for using three songs from ''The Fragile'' on air without permission. The songs "La Mer", "The Great Below", and "The Mark Has Been Made" appeared in an episode of ''[[War Stories with Oliver North]]'' detailing the [[battle of Iwo Jima]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://theninhotline.net/news/archives/backissue/06/10#1161617908 |title= Fox News, War Stories, and Nine Inch Nails |publisher=The NIN Hotline |date= [[2006-10-23]] |accessdate= 2006-11-29}}</ref> A post appeared on Reznor's blog, which read: "Thanks for the Fox News heads-up.
