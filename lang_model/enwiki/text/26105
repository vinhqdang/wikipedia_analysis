The '''music of the Lesser Antilles''' encompasses the [[music]] of this chain of small islands making up the eastern and southern portion of the [[West Indies]]. [[Lesser Antilles|Lesser Antillean]] music is part of the broader category of [[Caribbean music]]; much of the [[folk music|folk]] and [[popular music]] is also a part of the [[Afro-American music]]al complex, being a mixture of African, European and indigenous American elements. The Lesser Antilles' musical cultures are largely based on the music of [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]] brought by European traders and colonizers. The [[music of Africa|African music]]al elements are a hybrid of instruments and styles from numerous [[West Africa]]n tribes, while the European slaveholders added their own musics into the mix, as did immigrants from [[India]]. In many ways, the Lesser Antilles can be musically divided based on which nation colonized them.

The ex-[[British colonization of the Americas|British colonies]] include [[Trinidad and Tobago]], whose [[calypso music|calypso]] style is an especially potent part of the music of the other former British colonies, which also share traditions like the [[Big Drum]] dance.  The [[French colonial empires|French islands]] of Martinique and Guadeloupe share the popular ''[[zouk]]'' style and have also had extensive musical contact with the [[music of Haiti]], itself once a French colony though not part of the Lesser Antilles. The [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch colonies]] of [[Cura<U+00E7>ao]], [[Bonaire]] and [[Aruba]] share the [[combined rhythm]] popular style. The islands also share a passion for [[kaseko]], a genre of [[music of Suriname|Surinamese music]]; Suriname and its neighbors [[Guyana]] and [[French Guiana]] share folk and popular styles that are connected enough to the Antilles and other Caribbean islands that both countries are studied in the broader context of Antillean or Caribbean music.

==Characteristics==
While Lesser Antillean music is very often discussed as a [[music area]], this division is of limited usefulness. The islands of the Lesser Antilles divide musically along linguistic lines, with the most significant overlap coming from [[Dominica]] and [[Saint Lucia]], both primarily [[Caribbean English|Anglophone]] but strongly influenced by a French colonial past. Because the islands are divided linguistically, the term ''Antillean music'' is usually used in reference to one such music area. Thus, for example, the ''Rough Guide to World Music'' features a chapter on "Antillean music", which is entirely about the French Antillean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe, with a brief sidebar specifically about the Dutch Antilles. 

In the context of Anglophone music, the term ''Antillean music'' most commonly refers to [[Trinidad and Tobago]], home to the well-known calypso style. Music author Peter Manuel, for example, treats all the Anglophone islands as a subject of Trinidadian calypso traditions, while using the title ''Music of the Lesser Antilles'' for Francophone Antillean music. Manuel also, like many authors, treats Suriname and Guyana as integral aspects of Caribbean music; due to the Dutch colonial history of both countries, they are often grouped with Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles.<ref>De Ledesma and Scaramuzzo, pgs. 289<U+2013>303</ref><ref>Manuel, ''Caribbean Currents'', pgs. 140<U+2013>145, 183<U+2013>208</ref>

Nevertheless, Antillean music can be characterized by the prominence of the [[Caribbean Carnival|Carnival]] celebration (prominently from [[Trinidad and Tobago]]), and the importance of calypso-like song traditions. The Lesser Antilles is also home to a strong Indo-Caribbean population; though Indo-Caribbean music is found elsewhere in the Caribbean, the prominence of Indian-influenced styles is a hallmark of the Antillean music scenes. Regional forms can also be found outside of the Caribbean entirely, most notably in [[New York City]], where [[Brooklyn]]'s [[Labor Day Carnival]] features music and parades, mas and [[steelpan|steel bands]]; this Carnival is distinct to New York, and reflects elements of a pan-Caribbean nature.<ref>Manuel, ''Caribbean Currents'', pg. 210</ref>

===Calypso and calypso-like traditions===
{{see|list of calypso-like genres}}

[[Calypso music|Calypso]] is most closely associated with the island of [[Trinidad]], but it has spread throughout the Lesser Antilles, and abroad. Similar traditions can be found natively on many of Caribbean islands. Within the Antilles, most of the popular calypso stars have come from [[Trinidad and Tobago]]; the majority of the exceptions, such as [[Arrow (musician)|Arrow]] from Montserrat, have come from other Anglophone islands. Music author Peter Manuel has argued that, despite the modern Anglophone focus to calypso-like song forms, their origins lie in the "Afro-French creole culture", and notes that the ancestor of the word ''calypso'', ''cariso'', was first used to refer to a Martinican singer.<ref>Manuel, ''Caribbean Currents'', pg. 208</ref>

The calypso song complex is characterized by [[satire|satirical]], political, risque and humorous lyricism, a competitive and celebratory nature and its function in social organization and informal communication. Jamaican ''[[mento]]'' is perhaps the most well-known form of calypso-like music. The island of [[Carriacou]] is home to a calypso-like song style, as well as [[canboulay]] feasts, [[calinda]] songs and steel bands, all similar to though distinct from the related Trinidadian traditions. Modern influences from Trinidad have organized the Carriacou song style, and there are competitions similar to [[calypso tent]]s on the island.<ref>Manuel, pgs. 209<U+2013>210; Manuel specifically cites much of the material on Carriacou to Donald Hill, ''Calypso Calaloo: Early Carnival Music in Trinidad'' (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 1993)''</ref> The Antiguan [[benna]] is part of the same song complex, featuring news-oriented and ribald, often satirical lyrics and a rhythmic, uptempo style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antiguamuseums.org/cultural.htm#Calypso|title=Calypso|work=Antigua and Barbuda's Cultural Heritage|accessdate=December 3|accessyear=2005}}</ref>

===Carnival===
{{details|Caribbean Carnival}}
[[Image:VICarnivaltroupe.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Carnival troupe in the Virgin Islands]]

Annual [[Caribbean Carnival|Carnival]] celebrations are an important part of the culture of all the Lesser Antillean islands. Carnival is celebrated at varying times of year, either pre-[[Lent]], [[Christmas]]time or in July and August, and feature a wide variety of dances, songs and parades. Contests are common, especially Calypso King and Queen contests, which are held on most of the British Antillean islands, the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] as well as French [[Saint Martin]] and elsewhere. The British Antillean Carnivals are also mostly united by the [[J'ouvert]] tradition, which involves calypso and [[Soca music|soca]] band parades and are the highlight of their celebrations.

Summer Carnivals include those on [[Antigua]], Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, [[Sint Eustatius]], [[Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint John]], Saint Lucia, Grenada, [[Saba]], [[Nevis]] and Anguilla, the latter two of which are especially known for popular calypso competitions. Christmastime Carnivals are held on Montserrat, [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Croix]], Saint Martin and [[Saint Kitts]]; Montserrat's distinctive Carnival includes [[masquerade]]s and steelbands, and both islands also feature calypso competitions. The Carnival of Sint Maarten, which takes place a month after [[Easter]], is known for the burning of King Moui-Moui as the culmination of the festival. Many islands, especially the French and Dutch Antilles, are home to pre-Lenten Carnivals, including Martinique, Aruba, [[Saint-Barth<U+00E9>lemy]], Bonaire, Cura<U+00E7>ao, Dominica, [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]] and Guadeloupe.<ref>Cameron, pgs. 480, 502, 525, 536, 573, 593</ref>

There are many popular traditions common to the English-speaking islands of the Lesser Antilles. [[Calypso music|Calypso]], originally from the island of [[Trinidad]], has spread to the neighboring islands; other Trinidadian popular traditions, like [[soca music|soca]], are also well-known throughout the region. [[Steelpan|Steel drum]] ensembles is also found throughout the English-speaking Lesser Antilles (and abroad), especially in Trinidad and Tobago as well as Antigua and Barbuda. The British Antilles also share in certain folk traditions. Trinidadian folk calypso is found throughout the area, as are African-Caribbean religious music styles like the [[Shango]] music of Trinidad.<ref name="Manuel183">Manuel, ''Caribbean Currents'', pgs. 183<U+2013>211</ref>  Variants of the [[Big Drum]] festival occur throughout the [[Windward Islands]], especially in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Carnival is an important folk music celebration on all the islands of the Lesser Antilles, and the rest of the Caribbean.

Calypso is part of a spectrum of similar folk and popular Caribbean styles that spans [[benna]] and [[mento]], but remains the most prominent genre of Lesser Antillean music. Calypso's roots are  somewhat unclear, but we know it can be traced to 18th-century [[Trinidad]]. Modern calypso, however, began in the 19th century, a fusion of disparate elements ranging from the [[masquerade]] song ''[[lavway]]'', French Creole ''[[belair (dance)|belair]]'' and the [[stick fighting]] [[chantwell]]. Calypso's early rise was closely connected with the adoption of Carnival by [[Trinidadian]] slaves, including [[camboulay]] drumming and the music masquerade processions. Popular calypso arose in the early 20th century, with the rise of internationally known [[calypsonian]]s like [[Attila the Hun (calypsonian)|Attila the Hun]]<ref>Quevedo, Raymond (Atilla the Hun). 1983. ''Atilla's '''Kaiso''': a short history of Trinidad calypso''. [[University of the West Indies]], [[Saint Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago|St. Augustine]], Trinidad. (Includes the words to many old calypsos as well as musical scores for some of Atilla's calypsos.)</ref>  and [[Roaring Lion]].<ref name="Manuel183"/> [[Trinidadian]] calypso remained popular throughout the Caribbean in the later 20th century, and other Antillean islands like [[Antigua]] began producing calypso stars. In the 1970s, a calypso variant called [[Soca music|soca]] arose, characterized by a focus on dance rhythms rather than lyricism. Soca has since spread across the Caribbean and abroad.<ref name="Manuel183"/>

[[Image:MongoosePlay.jpg|thumb|left|320px|The Mongoose Play, a popular Kittitian production of folk theatre and music]]

Steel drums are a distinctively [[Trinidadian]] ensemble that evolved from improvised percussion instruments used in Carnival processions. By the late 1930s, [[bamboo]] tubes, a traditional instrumental, were supplemented by pieces of metal used percussively; over time, these metal percussion instruments were pitched to produce as many as twenty-some tones. Steel bands were large orchestras of these drums, and were banned by the British colonial authorities. Nevertheless, steel drums spread across the Caribbean, and are now an entrenched part of the culture of [[Trinidad and Tobago]].<ref name="Manuel183"/>

Though [[Trinidadian]] popular music is by far the most well-known style of Lesser Antillean music, the other Anglophone islands are home to their own musical traditions. [[Carriacou]] and [[Grenada]] are home to Carnival celebrations that feature distinct form of calypso, [[canboulay]] feasts, [[calinda]] stick-fighting songs and the steelband accompanied [[jouvert]], as well as the Big Drum dance, which is also found in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.<ref name="Manuel183"/> Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines share other musics as well including the funereal music of the [[saraca]] rite, a [[call-and-response]] form with both European and African lyrics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.paradise-inn-carriacou.com/tombstone.php |title=Paradise Inn |accessdate=2006-11-08 |author=J.

French Creole music is most famously associated with [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]], though the islands of [[Saint Lucia]] and [[Dominica]] are also home to French Antillean music. Creole music is characterized by the prominence of the [[quadrille]] dance, distinct from the French version and related to the Haitian ''[[mereng]]''.  The quadrille is a potent symbol of French Antillean culture.<ref name="Manuel140">Manuel, ''Caribbean Currents'', pgs. 140<U+2013>141</ref>  Martinique and Guadeloupe are also home to their own distinct folk traditions, most influentially including Guadeloupan ''[[gwo ka]]'' and Martinican ''[[tambour]]'' and ''[[twi ba]]''. ''Gwo ka'' is a type of percussion music which consists of seven basic rhythms and variations on them. It has been modernized into ''[[gwo ka moderne]]'', though traditional rural performances (''[[lewoz]]'') are still common.<ref name="WorldMusic">De Ledesma, Charles and Gene Scaramuzzo</ref> Tambour and twi ba ensembles are the origin of several important Martinican popular styles, including ''[[chouval bwa]]'' and ''[[biguine]]'', and also exterted an influence on zouk. Lucian folk music features ensembles of [[fiddle]], [[cuatro]], [[banjo]], [[guitar]] and [[chak-chak]] (a [[rattle]]), with the banjo and cuatro being of iconic importance, and recreational, often lyric song forms called ''[[jw&eacute;]]''.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Saint Lucia|author=Guilbault, Jocelyne|title=Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, Volume Two: South America, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean|id=ISBN 0-8153-1865-0|year=1999|publisher=Routledge}}</ref> The French Creole folk music of Dominica are based around the quadrille, accompanied by ensembles called ''[[jing ping]]''. Folk [[storytelling]] (''kont'') and songs (''b&eacute;l&eacute;'') are also a major part of the country's musical identity.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Dominica|author=Guilbault, Jocelyne|title=Garland Encyclopedia of World Music|volume=Volume 2|id=ISBN 0-8153-1865-0|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|pages=pp 840<U+2013>844}}</ref>

Music authors Charles De Ledesma and Gene Scaramuzzo trace zouk's development to the Guadeloupan gwo ka and Martinican ''tambour'' and ''twi ba'' folk traditions. Ethnomusicologist Jocelyn Guilbault, however, describes zouk as a synthesis of Caribbean popular styles, especially [[cadence-lypso]], ''biguine'', ''[[kompa direk]]'' and ''[[kadans rampa]]''.<ref>Guilbault, Jocelyn, Gage Averill, <U+00C9>douard Benoit and Gregory Rabess, ''Zouk: World Music in the West Indies'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993), cited in Manuel, pg. 142</ref> Zouk arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s, using elements of previous styles of Antillean music, as well as imported genres. In the 1950s, Haitian [[compas]] and [[cadence rampa]] became the dominant pop sounds of the Lesser Antilles, especially [[Webert Sicot]] and [[Nemours Jean Baptiste]]. These were followed by the Antillean [[mini-jazz]] bands like [[Les Gentlemen]], [[Les Leopards]] and [[Les Vikings de Guadeloupe]] in the late 1970s, who drew on the Haitian sound of Sicot and Baptiste. Later in the decade and into the 1980s, the French Antilles became home to a style of cadence music called cadence-lypso. [[Gordon Henderson]]'s [[Exile One]] innovated this style by adding calypso [[horn section|horns]], and turned the mini-jazz combos into guitar-dominated big bands, paving the way for the success of large groups like [[Malavoi]], among others. Drawing on these influences, the supergroup [[Kassav']] invented zouk and popularized it with hit songs like "Zouk-La-Se Sel Medikaman Nou Ni". Kassav' formed from Paris in 1978. Kassav' soon added elements of [[rock music|rock]] and other influences and became some of the biggest stars in the Caribbean, France and elsewhere as zouk diversified into multiple subgenres. These include [[zouk-love]], pop ballads by artists like [[Edith Lefel]] and [[Gilles Floro]], and [[zouk funk]] and [[ragga-zouk]] bands like [[Lord Kossity]] who fused the genre with other influences.<ref name="WorldMusic"/>

Though zouk is the most well-known form of modern French Antillean music, the island of Martinique has also produced the ''chouval bwa'' and ''biguine'' styles, which were especially popular in the early 20th century. Chouval bwa is includes multiple distinctive instruments and internationally famous performers like [[Claude Germany]], [[Dede Saint-Prix]], [[Pakatak]] and [[Tumpak]], while biguine has achieved international fame since the 1920s and has since been modernized and adapted for pop audiences, making it a major influence on zouk.<ref name="WorldMusic">De Ledesma, Charles and Gene Scaramuzzo</ref> Between the 1930s and 1950s, the dance ''biguine'' was popular among the islands' dance orchestras. The ''biguine'' uses a ''cinquillo'' variant related to that found in other Caribbean genres like ''mereng'' and ''kompa direk''. In the 1940s and 1950s, these dance bands absorbed influences from Cuban, American and Haitian popular music.<ref name="Manuel140"/>

The islands of [[Cura<U+00E7>ao]], [[Bonaire]], [[Aruba]], [[Sint Eustatius]] and [[Saint Martin]] share musical styles, as well as maintain their own sets of folk and popular dances, ranging from the impromptu Statian [[roadblock (disambiguation)|road block]] to calypso, zouk and [[Soca music|soca]].<ref>Cameron, pgs. 549<U+2013>582</ref> African, indigenous and European ancestry predominate, though more recent immigrants have brought musical styles from [[Lebanon]], [[China]] and India. In popular music, the islands are known for the [[Combined Rhythm]], like local favorites the [[Happy Peanuts]] and [[Expresando Rimto i Ambiente]]. [[Kaseko]] music from the mainland country [[Suriname]] is also popular.<ref name="WorldMusic"/> Traditional music of Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles, however, is primarily African, characterized by the use of complex, highly developed polyrhythms, dance styles and drums like the ''tamb<U+00FA>''. Other African-derived instruments include metal percussion rods, ''agan'', the [[rasp]] ''wiri'', aerophones like the ''cachu'' trumpet, ''becu'' transverse double-reed wind instrument, and the [[bow (musical instrument)|bow]] ''benta''.<ref name="Garland">''Garland Encyclopedia of World Music'', pp. 927<U+2013>931</ref>

The ''tambu'' is an instrument, and a form of music and dance found on Aruba, Bonaire (where it is sometimes known as ''bari''), and Cura<U+00E7>ao. The ''tambu'' is an especially important symbol of Cura<U+00E7>aoan identity. Instrumentation for the ''tambu'' uses the ''agan'', ''chapi'', [[triangle (instrument)|triangle]], ''wiri'' and other instruments, many of which are also part of the African-derived ''muziek di zumbi'', or ''spirit music'', of Cura<U+00E7>ao.<ref name="NewGrove">''New Grove Encyclopedia of Music'', pp 775<U+2013>777</ref> Cura<U+00E7>ao's folk music also includes a rich tradition of [[work song]]s with apentatonic lyrics sung in [[Guene language|Guene]] or a [[Papiamento]] variant called ''seshi''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.Curacao-travelguide.com/culture/index.html |title=Cura<U+00E7>ao Culture & Folklore |accessdate=2006-11-08}}</ref> The [[Simadan]] harvest festival is found across the islands, and features the ''cachu'' trumpet, made from a cowhorn. Bonaire's Simadan festival is also notable for the use of the ''becu'', an aerophone made from the stalk of a [[sorghum]] plant, and the ''kinkon'', made from a [[conch]] shell and known elsewhere as the ''carco''. Folk song forms range from the harvest ''seu'', ''simadan'' and ''wapa''. Other songs were imported beginning in the 19th century, including the South American ''[[joropo]]'' and ''[[pasillo]]'', Spanish Caribbean ''[[merengue music|merengue]]'' and other new songs, dances and instruments. This diverse mixture was the origin of the Dutch Antilles' most distinctive and long-standing popular tradition, the ''[[tumba]]''.<ref name="NewGrove"/>

The smaller islands of Saint Martin, Saba and Sint Eustatius largely share in the same folk instruments, dances and songs as their neighbors; however, these islands remain largely unstudied. Saba is home to a vital percussive music tradition, most closely associated with private parties, using instrumentation similar to Curacau, Bonaire and Aruba. Saint Martin is home to a national dance form called the ''[[ponum]]'', which dates to the 19th century and was only displaced by string bands in the mid-20th century. Saint Martin is also home to a calypso-like ''[[quimbe]]'' song form, that remains a major part of the island's culture.<ref name="NewGrove"/>

[[Indo-Caribbean people]] in the Lesser Antillean music area are clustered in Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. Indo-Caribbean folk traditions include the ''[[chowtal]]'' songs from the springtime festival ''phagwa'', and [[Hindi language|Hindi]] ''[[bhajan]]s'' which are still sung at temples despite there being few people who understand Hindi. Guyanese and Trinidadian Indo-Caribbeans developed a tradition that fused elements of calypso with the folk music of North India, a style that was referred to as ''local music''.<ref name="Manuel214">Manuel, ''East Indian Music in the West Indies'', pgs. 212<U+2013>221</ref>

Indo-Caribbean music plays a vital role in various annual festivals like the springtime phagwa, where chowtal is traditionally performed competitively and in teams. Indo-Caribbean [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]] celebrate ''Hosay'' ([[Muharram]]) with [[float]]s accompanied by barrel drums called [[tassa]]. [[Wedding music]] is another important part of Indo-Caribbean music, and is dominated by [[tan singing]]. Tan singing is based around the ''[[dholak]]'' drum and ''dantal'', and sometimes includes verbal duels influenced by [[picong]].<ref name="Manuel214"/> Indo-Caribbean popular music gained international attention in the late 1980s, with the rise of [[chutney music]].  Chutney is a dance music, in its modern form accompanied by [[soca music|soca]] instrumentation, such as synthesizers and pressure drums. This style is called [[chutney-soca]].<ref name="Manuel214"/>
