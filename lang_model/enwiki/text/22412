The separation of the stereoisomers is one of the easier in organic chemistry and is described in the original patent.  It involves "treatment of racemic methadone base with d-(+)-tartaric acid in an acetone/water mixture [which] precipitates almost solely the dextro-methadone levo-tartrate, and the more potent levo-methadone can easily be retrieved from the mother liquor in a high state of optical purity" <ref>https://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/methadone.html</ref>

== Regulatory status ==
Levomethadone is listed under the Single Convention On Narcotic Drugs 1961 and is a Schedule II Narcotic controlled substance in the US as an isomer of methadone (ACSCN 9250) and is not listed separately, nor is dextromethadone.<ref>http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/quotas/conv_factor/index.html</ref>  It  is similarly controlled under the German [[Bet<U+00E4>ubungsmittelgesetz]] and similar laws in practically every other country.
