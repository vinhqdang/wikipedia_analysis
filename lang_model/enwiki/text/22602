'''<U+00C6>thelbald''' (also spelled '''Ethelbald''', or '''Aethelbald''')<ref>The spelling "<U+00C6>thelbald" uses the [[Old English language#Orthography|Anglo-Saxon alphabet]], and so can be considered the most authentic; however, it has occasionally been modernized in secondary sources to "Ethelbald" or "Aethelbald".</ref> (died 757) was the [[List of monarchs of Mercia|King]] of [[Mercia]], in what is now the [[English Midlands]], from 716 until 757. During his long reign, Mercia became the dominant kingdom of the Anglo-Saxons, and recovered the position of pre-eminence it had enjoyed during the seventh century under the strong Mercian kings [[Penda of Mercia|Penda]] and [[Wulfhere of Mercia|Wulfhere]]. [[Mercian Supremacy|Mercian domination of England]] continued until the end of the eighth century; [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]], the grandson of <U+00C6>thelbald's cousin Eanwulf, ruled for an additional thirty-nine years, starting shortly after <U+00C6>thelbald's murder.

<U+00C6>thelbald came to the throne on the death of his cousin, King [[Ceolred of Mercia|Ceolred]]. Both [[Wessex]] and [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] were ruled by strong kings at that time, but within fifteen years the contemporary chronicler [[Bede]] describes <U+00C6>thelbald as ruling all England south of the river [[Humber]]. The [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] does not list <U+00C6>thelbald as a [[bretwalda]], or "Ruler of Britain", though this may be due to the West Saxon origin of the Chronicle.

[[Saint Boniface|St Boniface]] wrote to <U+00C6>thelbald in about 745, reproving him for various dissolute and irreligious acts. The subsequent 747 [[council of Clovesho]], and a charter <U+00C6>thelbald issued at Gumley in 749&mdash;which freed the church from some of its obligations&mdash;may have been responses to Boniface's letter. <U+00C6>thelbald was killed in 757 by his bodyguards. He was succeeded briefly by [[Beornrad of Mercia|Beornrad]], of whom little is known, but within a year Offa had seized the throne.

==Early life and accession==
<U+00C6>thelbald came of the Mercian royal line, although his father, Alweo, was never king. Alweo<U+2019>s father was Eowa, who may have shared the throne for some time with his brother, Penda of Mercia. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle does not mention Eowa; though it does date Penda<U+2019>s reign as the thirty years from 626 to 656, when Penda was killed at the [[battle of the Winwaed]]. However, two later sources name Eowa as king as well: the [[Historia Brittonum]] and the [[Annales Cambriae]]. The Annales Cambriae is the source for Eowa's death in 644 at the [[battle of Maserfield]], where Penda defeated [[Oswald of Northumbria]]. Details on Penda<U+2019>s reign are scarce, and it is a matter for speculation whether Eowa was an underking, owing allegiance to Penda, or if instead Eowa and Penda had divided Mercia between them. If they did divide the kingdom, it is likely that Eowa ruled northern Mercia, as Penda<U+2019>s son Peada was established later as the king of southern Mercia by the Northumbrian [[Oswiu of Northumbria|Oswiu]], who defeated the Mercians and killed Penda in 656. It is possible that Eowa fought against Penda at Maserfield.<ref name=Kirby_91>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 91.</ref>

During <U+00C6>thelbald's youth, Penda's dynasty ruled Mercia; [[Ceolred of Mercia|Ceolred]], a grandson of Penda and therefore a second cousin of <U+00C6>thelbald, was king of Mercia from 709 to 716.<ref name=Kirby_227>See the genealogy in figure 8 of the appendix, in Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 227.</ref>  An early source, Felix's ''Life of Saint Guthlac'', reveals that it was Ceolred who drove <U+00C6>thelbald into exile.<ref name=Kirby_129>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 129.</ref> [[Saint Guthlac|Guthlac]] was a Mercian nobleman who abandoned a career of violence to become first a monk at [[Repton]], and later a hermit living in a [[tumulus|barrow]] at [[Crowland]], in the East Anglian fens.<ref name=Campbell_82>Campbell, ''The Anglo-Saxons'', p. 82.</ref>  During <U+00C6>thelbald's exile he and his men also took refuge in the Fens in the area, and visited Guthlac.<ref name=Kirby_129 /> Guthlac was sympathetic to <U+00C6>thelbald's cause, perhaps because of Ceolred's oppression of the monasteries.<ref name=Stenton_203>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 203<U+2013>205.</ref>   Other visitors of Guthlac's included Bishop Haedde of [[Lichfield]], an influential Mercian, and it may be that Guthlac's support was politically useful to <U+00C6>thelbald in gaining the throne. After Guthlac's death, <U+00C6>thelbald had a dream in which Guthlac prophesied greatness for him, and <U+00C6>thelbald later rewarded Guthlac with a shrine when he had become king.<ref name=Kirby_129 /><ref name=Campbell_94>Campbell, ''The Anglo-Saxons'', p. 94.</ref>

When Ceolred died of a fit at a banquet,<ref name=Whitelock_177>{{cite book |last= Whitelock|first= Dorothy|title= English Historical Documents: Vol. 1 c500<U+2013>1042|pages=755|year= 1968|publisher= Oxford University Press}}</ref> <U+00C6>thelbald returned to Mercia and became ruler. It is possible that a king named Ceolwald, perhaps a brother of Ceolred, reigned for a short while between Ceolred and <U+00C6>thelbald.<ref name=Kirby_129 /><ref>{{cite book |last= Yorke|first= Barbara|title= Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England|pages=111|year= 1990|publisher= Seaby|isbn=1-85264-027-8}}</ref>  <U+00C6>thelbald's accession ended Penda's line of descent; <U+00C6>thelbald's reign was followed, after a brief interval, by that of Offa, another descendant of Eowa.<ref name=Kirby_227 />

==Mercian dominance==
[[Image:British seventh century kingdoms.gif|thumb|right|200px|The kingdoms of Britain in the late seventh century, when <U+00C6>thelbald was born.]]

<U+00C6>thelbald's reign marked a resurgence of Mercian power, which would last until the end of the eighth century.<ref name=BlairRBaEE_168>Hunter Blair, ''Roman Britain'', p. 168.</ref>  With the exception of the short reign of [[Beornrad of Mercia|Beornrad]], who succeeded <U+00C6>thelbald for less than a year, Mercia was ruled for eighty years by two of the most powerful Anglo-Saxon kings, <U+00C6>thelbald and Offa.<ref name=Swanton_46>Beornrad was "put to flight" by Offa in one version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle; according to another, he held the kingdom for "a little while, and unhappily". Swanton, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 46<U+2013>50.</ref>  These long reigns were unusual at this early date; during the same period eleven kings reigned in [[Northumbria]], many of whom died violent deaths.<ref name=BlairAITASE_52>Hunter Blair, ''An Introduction'', p. 755.</ref>

By 731, <U+00C6>thelbald had all the English south of the Humber under his overlordship.<ref name=Bede_PC_324>Bede, p. 324, translated by Leo Sherley-Price.</ref>  There is little direct evidence of the relationship between <U+00C6>thelbald and the kings who were dependent on him.<ref name=Stenton_203 />  Generally, a king subject to an overlord such as <U+00C6>thelbald would still be regarded as a king, but would have his independence curtailed in some respects. [[Charter]]s are an important source of evidence for this relationship; these were documents which granted land to followers or to churchmen, and were witnessed by the kings who had power to grant the land.<ref name=BlairRBaEE_14>Hunter Blair, ''Roman Britain'', pp. 14<U+2013>15.</ref><ref name=Campbell_95_2>Campbell, ''The Anglo-Saxons'', pp. 95-98.</ref>  A charter granting land in the territory of one of the subject kings might record the names of the king as well as the overlord on the witness list appended to the grant; such a witness list can be seen on the [[Ismere Diploma]], for example. The titles given to the kings on these charters could also be revealing: a king might be described as a "subregulus", or underking.<ref name=Campbell_123>For an account of the progression from Offa's overlordship of the Hwicce to suppression of the ruling dynasty, and consequent absorption of the kingdom into Mercia, see Campbell, ''The Anglo-Saxons'', p.123.</ref>

Enough information survives to suggest the progress of <U+00C6>thelbald's influence over two of the southern kingdoms, [[Wessex]] and [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]]. At the start of <U+00C6>thelbald's reign, both Kent and Wessex were ruled by strong kings; [[Wihtred of Kent|Wihtred]] and [[Ine of Wessex|Ine]], respectively. Wihtred of Kent died in 725, and Ine of Wessex, one of the most formidable rulers of his day, abdicated in 726 to go on a pilgrimage to Rome. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Ine's successor, [[Aethelheard of Wessex|Aethelheard]], fought that year with an [[ealdorman]] named Oswald, whom the Chronicle provides with a genealogy showing descent from [[Ceawlin of Wessex|Ceawlin]], an early king of Wessex.<ref name=Swanton_42>Swanton, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 42<U+2013>43.</ref> Aethelheard ultimately succeeded in this struggle for the throne, and there are subsequent indications that he ruled subject to Mercian authority. Hence it may be that <U+00C6>thelbald helped establish both Aethelheard and his brother, Cuthred, who succeeded Aethelheard in 739.<ref name=Kirby_133>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 133.</ref>  There is also evidence of South Saxon territory breaking away from West Saxon dominance in the early 720s, and this may indicate <U+00C6>thelbald's increasing influence in the area, though it could have been Kentish, rather than Mercian, influence that was weakening West Saxon control.<ref name=Kirby_131>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 131.</ref>

As for Kent, there is evidence from Kentish [[Chartulary|charters]] that shows that <U+00C6>thelbald was a patron of Kentish churches.<ref name=Campbell_95>Campbell, ''The Anglo-Saxons'', p. 95.</ref>  There is, however, no charter evidence showing <U+00C6>thelbald's consent to Kentish land grants; and charters of [[Aethelberht of Kent|Aethelberht]] and [[Eadbert I of Kent|Eadberht]], both kings of Kent, survive in which they grant land without <U+00C6>thelbald's consent.<ref name=Kirby_132>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.132.</ref> It may be that charters showing <U+00C6>thelbald's overlordship simply do not survive, but the result is that there is no direct evidence of the extent of <U+00C6>thelbald's influence in Kent.

Less is known about events in Essex, but it was at about this time that London became attached to the kingdom of Mercia rather than that of Essex. Three of <U+00C6>thelbald's predecessors&mdash;[[<U+00C6>thelred of Mercia|<U+00C6>thelred]], [[Coenred of Mercia|Coenred]], and Ceolred&mdash;had each confirmed an East Saxon charter granting Twickenham to Waldhere, the [[List of bishops of London|bishop of London]]. From Kentish charters it is known that <U+00C6>thelbald was in control of London, and from <U+00C6>thelbald's time on, the transition to Mercian control appears to be complete; an early charter of Offa's, granting land near Harrow, does not even include the king of Essex on the witness list.<ref name=Stenton_203 /><ref name=Campbell_95 />  For the South Saxons, there is very little charter evidence, but as with Kent, what there is does not show any requirement for <U+00C6>thelbald's consent to land grants.<ref name=Kirby_132 />   The lack of evidence should not obscure the fact that Bede, who was after all a contemporary chronicler, summarized the situation of England in 731 by listing the bishops in office in southern England, and adding that "all these provinces, together with the others south of the river Humber and their kings, are subject to <U+00C6>thelbald, King of the Mercians."<ref name=Bede_PC_324 />

There is evidence that <U+00C6>thelbald had to go to war to maintain his overlordship. In 733 <U+00C6>thelbald undertook an expedition against Wessex and captured the royal [[manorialism|manor]] of [[Somerton]]. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle also tells how when [[Cuthred of Wessex|Cuthred]] succeeded Aethelheard to the throne of Wessex, in 740, he "boldly made war against Aethelbald, king of Mercia".<ref name=Swanton_44>Swanton, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp 44<U+2013>45.</ref>  Three years later, Cuthred and <U+00C6>thelbald are described as fighting against the Welsh. This could have been an obligation placed on Cuthred by Mercia; earlier kings had similarly assisted [[Penda of Mercia|Penda]] and [[Wulfhere of Mercia|Wulfhere]], two strong seventh-century Mercian rulers.<ref name=Kirby_133 />  In 752, <U+00C6>thelbald and Cuthred are again on opposite sides of the conflict, and according to one version of the manuscript, Cuthred "put him [<U+00C6>thelbald] to flight" at [[Battle Edge|Burford]].<ref name=Swanton_46_2>Swanton, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', 46<U+2013>47.</ref> <U+00C6>thelbald seems to have reasserted his authority over the West Saxons by the time of his death, since a later West Saxon king, [[Cynewulf of Wessex|Cynewulf]], is recorded as witnessing a charter of <U+00C6>thelbald at the very beginning of his reign, in 757.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+96 | title = Anglo-Saxons.net: S 96 | accessdate=28 April 2007 }}</ref>

In 740, a war between the Picts and the Northumbrians is reported. <U+00C6>thelbald, who might have been allied with [[<U+00D3>engus I of the Picts|<U+00D3>engus]],<ref name=Campbell_95 /> the king of the Picts, took advantage of [[Eadberht of Northumbria|Eadberht]]'s absence from Northumbria to ravage his lands, and perhaps burn [[York]].<ref>Anderson, ''Scottish Annals'', pp. 55<U+2013>56.</ref>

==Titles and Bretwaldaship==
[[Image:Aethelbald charter Cyneberht 736.jpg|thumb|200px|The ''[[Ismere Diploma]]'', a charter of King <U+00C6>thelbald's to Ealdorman Cyneberht in 736.]]

Earlier in Bede's ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'' chronicle, he lists seven kings who governed the southern provinces of the English, with reigns dating from the late fifth to the late seventh century. Subsequently, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&mdash;another important source for the period&mdash;describes these seven as ''[[bretwalda]]s'' or ''brytenwaldas'', a title translated as "Britain-ruler" or "Wide-ruler".<ref name=Swanton_60>The different versions of the title, "bretwalda" and "brytenwalda", are in the A and E texts of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, in the entry for 827. Swanton, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 60<U+2013>61.</ref>  The Chronicle adds just one king to the list: [[Egbert of Wessex]], who reigned in the ninth century. The resulting list of eight ''bretwaldas'' omits several strong Mercian kings. It is possible that the chronicler was merely adding Egbert's name to Bede's original list of seven, rather than claiming that no other kings achieved similar powers in England. The chronicler was almost certainly a West Saxon, and since neither <U+00C6>thelbald nor Offa were kings of Wessex it is possible the chronicler does not mention them out of regional pride.<ref name=KL_11>See comment and footnote 2 in {{cite book |last= Keynes|first= Simon|coauthors=Lapidge , Michael|title= Alfred the Great: Asser's Life of King Alfred and other contemporary sources|pages=11, 210|year= 2004|publisher= Penguin Classics|isbn=0-140-44409-2}}</ref><ref name=BlairAITASE_201>Hunter Blair, ''An Introduction'', p. 201.</ref>  The meaning of the term "bretwalda", and the nature of the power that these eight kings wielded, has had much academic scrutiny. One suggested interpretation is that since Bede was writing during <U+00C6>thelbald's reign, the original seven he listed were essentially those kings who could be seen as prototypes of <U+00C6>thelbald in their domination of England south of the Humber.<ref name=Kirby_19>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 19.</ref>

Further evidence of <U+00C6>thelbald's power, or at least his titles, is provided by an important charter of 736, the [[Ismere Diploma]], which survives in a contemporary (and possibly original) copy. It starts by describing <U+00C6>thelbald as "king not only of the Mercians but also of all the provinces which are called by the general name South English"; in the witness list he is further named "Rex Britanniae", "King of Britain".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&type=charter&id=89 | title = Anglo-Saxons.net: S 89 | accessdate=27 April 2007 }}</ref><ref name=Fletcher_98>Fletcher, ''Who's Who'', pp. 98-100.</ref> One historian described this title as "a phrase which can only be interpreted as a Latin rendering of the English title ''Bretwalda''";<ref name=Stenton_203 /> but it may be that at that time these titles would not have been acknowledged much beyond [[Worcester]], where this and other documents from the 730s that use similar titles were written.<ref name=Kirby_130>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.130.</ref>

==Relations with the church==
In 745&ndash;746, the leading Anglo-Saxon missionary in Germany, [[Saint Boniface|St Boniface]], along with seven other bishops, sent <U+00C6>thelbald a scorching letter reproaching him for many sins&mdash;stealing ecclesiastical revenue, violating church privileges, imposing forced labour on the clergy, and fornicating with nuns.<ref name=Fletcher_98 /> The letter implored <U+00C6>thelbald to take a wife and abandon the sin of lust:

<blockquote>We therefore, beloved son, beseech Your Grace by Christ the son of God and by His coming and by His kingdom, that if it is true that you are continuing in this vice you will amend your life by penitence, purify yourself, and bear in mind how vile a thing it is through lust to change the image of God created in you into the image and likeness of a vicious demon. Remember that you were made king and ruler over many not by your own merits but by the abounding grace of God, and now you are making yourself by your own lust the slave of an evil spirit.<ref>Emerton, ''Letters'', p. 105.</ref></blockquote>

Boniface first sent the letter to [[Ecgbert, Archbishop of York|Ecgberht]], the archbishop of York, asking him to correct any inaccuracies and reinforce whatever was right; and he requested Herefrith, a priest whom <U+00C6>thelbald had listened to in the past, to read and explain it to the king in person.<ref>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 135; Emerton, ''Letters'', pp. 108-109.</ref> Though Boniface's letter praises <U+00C6>thelbald's faith and alms-giving, its criticisms have strongly coloured subsequent opinion of <U+00C6>thelbald.<ref name=Fletcher_98 />  A claim made in a ninth-century list of donations from the abbey of Gloucester that <U+00C6>thelbald had "stabbed<U+2014>or smitten" to death the kinsman of a Mercian abbess has also contributed negatively to his reputation.<ref name=Kirby_134>Kirby (''Earliest English Kings'', p.134) cites two documents: Birch CS 535 (Sawyer 209), and Sawyer 1782. The CS 535 text can be seen in the original Latin at {{cite web | url = http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&type=charter&id=209 | title = Anglo-Saxons.net: S 209 | accessdate=28 April 2007 }}. See also: , F.M (1970). ''Anglo-Saxon England''. Oxford University Press; 3Rev Ed edition, 205. ISBN 0-19-821716-1.</ref> 

<U+00C6>thelbald may have influenced the appointment of successive archbishops of Canterbury in [[Tatwin]]e, [[Nothelm]], and [[Cuthbert, Archbishop of Canterbury|Cuthbert]], the latter probably the former bishop of Hereford;<ref name=Kirby_132 />  and despite Boniface's strong criticisms, there is evidence of <U+00C6>thelbald's positive interest in church affairs. A subsequent letter of Boniface's to Cuthbert, Archbishop of Canterbury, provided a good deal of information about Frankish [[synod]]s, especially one held in 747, the decrees of which Boniface included in the letter. Boniface does not explicitly suggest to Cuthbert that he, too, should hold a synod, but it seems clear that this was Boniface's intent.<ref name=Kirby_135_2>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 135<U+2013>136.</ref>  A council was, in fact, subsequently held at Clovesho (the location of which is now lost); <U+00C6>thelbald attended and perhaps presided. The council was concerned with the relationship between the church and the secular world, and it condemned many excesses on the part of the clergy.<ref name=FC>Richard Fletcher (''Who's Who'', p. 100) says that Archbishop Cuthbert of Canterbury presided, though he adds that the council could not have been convened without royal sanction; James Campbell (''The Anglo-Saxons'', p. 78) says that Aethelbald presided.</ref>  The council limited relations between monks and laymen and ruled that secular activities were impermissible for monks: secular business and secular songs were both forbidden, especially "ludicrous songs".  

[[Image:Repton crypt.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A 19th century engraving of the crypt at Repton where <U+00C6>thelbald was interred.]]

Two years after this, in 749, at the synod of [[Gumley]], <U+00C6>thelbald issued a charter that freed [[ecclesiastical]] lands from all obligations except the requirement to build forts and bridges&mdash;obligations which lay upon everyone, as part of the [[trinoda necessitas]]. This charter was witnessed only by Mercian bishops, and it is possible it had no effect outside Mercia, but it is also possible that it was essentially part of a reform programme inspired by Boniface and instigated at Clovesho.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&type=charter&id=92 | title = Anglo-Saxons.net: S 92 | accessdate=28 April 2007 }}</ref><ref name=Campbell_100>Campbell, ''The Anglo-Saxons'', p. 100.</ref>

==Death==
In 757, <U+00C6>thelbald was killed at [[Seckington]], [[Warwickshire]], near the royal seat of [[Tamworth]]. According to a later continuation of [[Bede]]'s ''Ecclesiastical History'', he was "treacherously murdered at night by his own bodyguards", though the reason why is unrecorded.<ref name=CCEL>The "continuation of Bede" is by other hands than Bede's, though the first few entries may be by Bede himself. See {{cite web | url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bede/history.v.v.xxiii.html| title = Bede's Ecclesiastical History of England: Christian Classic Ethereal Library | accessdate=3 June 2007 }}</ref>  He was succeeded, briefly, by [[Beornrad of Mercia|Beornrad]]. <U+00C6>thelbald was buried at [[Repton]], in a crypt which still can be seen; a contemporary is reported to have seen a vision of him in hell, reinforcing the impression of a king not universally well-regarded.<ref name=Kirby_134_2>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 134.</ref>  The monastery church on the site at that time was probably constructed by <U+00C6>thelbald to house the royal mausoleum; other burials there include that of [[Wigstan]].<ref name=Fletcher_98 /><ref name=Swanton_48>Swanton, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 48<U+2013>49.</ref><ref name=Fletcher_116>Fletcher, ''Who's Who'', p. 116.</ref>

A fragment of a stone cross survives at Repton which includes on one face a carved image of a man which, it has been suggested, may be a memorial to <U+00C6>thelbald. The figure is of a man wearing mail armour and carrying a sword and shield, with a [[diadem]] bound around his head.<ref name=Blackwell_Repton>{{cite book |last=Lapidge|first=Michael|title=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England|pages=392|year=1999|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=0-631-22492-0}}</ref>

==The Legend of Alfred III, King of Mercia==

According to a story recorded by the 16th century antiquarian [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]], and derived by him from a now lost book in the possession of the Earls of Rutland at [[Belvoir Castle]], there was once a King Alfred III of Mercia, who reigned in the 730s.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wCPVQe8J5_MC&pg=PA300&lpg=PA300&dq=%22alfred+iii+of+mercia%22&source=web&ots=9bwT7tLe_W&sig=1LWg8AAw7CBa6_6SYzZHBkoeLMA&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result Anglo-Saxon England (Michael Lapidge, Malcolm R. Godden & Simon Keynes)]</ref> Though no Mercian king was ever named Alfred, let alone three, if this story has any historical basis (which Leland himself rejected) it must presumably relate to <U+00C6>thelbald. The legend states that Alfred III had occasion to visit a certain William de Albanac, alleged ancestor of the Earls of Rutland, at his castle near [[Grantham]], and took a fancy to Willam's three comely daughters. It was the king's intention to take one as his mistress, but William threatened to kill whichever he chose rather than have her dishonoured in this way, whereupon Alfred "answerid that he meant to take one of them to wife, and chose Etheldrede that had fat bottoks, and of her he had Alurede that wan first all the Saxons the monarchy of England." A painting of this supposed incident was commissioned in 1778 by the then Duke of Rutland, but was destroyed in a fire in 1816.<ref>[http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/sdk13/histpaint/ashistpaint.html#alfthird1 Images of Anglo-Saxon England (Simon Keynes)]</ref>
