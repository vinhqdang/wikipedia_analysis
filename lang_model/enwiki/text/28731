==Description and behaviour==
[[Image:Blue whale tail.JPG|thumb|left|A blue whale lifting its tail flukes]]
[[Image:Blue Whale 001 body bw.jpg|thumb|Adult blue whale]]
The blue whale has a long tapering body that appears stretched in comparison with the stockier build of other whales.<ref name="des" /> The head is flat, ''U''-shaped and has a prominent ridge running from the [[Blowhole (biology)|blowhole]] to the top of the upper lip.<ref name="des" /> The front part of the mouth is thick with [[baleen]] plates; around 300 plates (each around one metre (3.2&nbsp;ft) long)<ref name="des" /> hang from the upper jaw, running 0.5&nbsp;m (1.6&nbsp;ft) back into the mouth. Between 70 and 118 grooves (called ventral pleats) run along the throat parallel to the body length. These pleats assist with evacuating water from the mouth after lunge feeding (see feeding below).

The [[dorsal fin]] is small,<ref name="des" /> ranging in height from {{convert|8|-|70|cm|in|sp=us}} (usually {{convert|20|-|40|cm|in|sp=us}}) and averaging about {{convert|28|cm}}.<ref name="MacWheel1929">{{cite journal

Located around three-quarters of the way along the length of the body, it varies in shape from one individual to another; some only have a barely perceptible lump, but others may have prominent and falcate (sickle-shaped) dorsals. When surfacing to breathe, the blue whale raises its shoulder and blowhole out of the water to a greater extent than other large whales, such as the fin or sei whales. Observers can use this trait to differentiate between species at sea. Some blue whales in the North Atlantic and North Pacific raise their tail fluke when diving. When breathing, the whale emits a spectacular vertical single-column spout up to {{convert|12|m|ft}}, typically {{convert|9|m|ft}}. Its [[lung]] capacity is 5,000&nbsp;litres (1320 U.S. gallons). Blue whales have twin blowholes shielded by a large splashguard.<ref name="des" />

The flippers are {{convert|3|-|4|m|ft}} long. The upper sides are grey with a thin white border; the lower sides are white. The head and tail fluke are generally uniformly grey. The whale's upper parts, and sometimes the flippers, are usually mottled. The degree of mottling varies substantially from individual to individual. Some may have a uniform slate-grey color, but others demonstrate a considerable variation of dark blues, greys and blacks, all tightly mottled.<ref name="factsheet">{{cite web

Blue whales can reach speeds of {{convert|50|km/h|mph}} over short bursts, usually when interacting with other whales, but {{convert|20|km/h|mph}} is a more typical traveling speed.<ref name="factsheet" /> When feeding, they slow down to {{convert|5|km/h|mph}}.

Blue whales most commonly live alone or with one other individual. It is not known how long traveling pairs stay together. In locations where there is a high concentration of food, as many as 50 blue whales have been seen scattered over a small area. They do not form the large, close-knit groups seen in other baleen species.

Blue whales are difficult to weigh because of their size. As is the case with most large whales targeted by whalers, adult blue whales have never been weighed whole, but cut up into manageable pieces first. This caused an underestimate of the total weight of the whale, due to the loss of blood and other fluids. As a whole, blue whales from the Northern Atlantic and Pacific appear to be smaller on average than those from sub-Antarctic waters. Nevertheless, measurements between {{convert|150|-|170|metric ton |short ton}} were recorded of animals up to {{convert|27|m|ft}} in length.

Blue whales gorge on krill in the rich waters of the Antarctic before migrating to their breeding grounds in the warmer, less-rich waters nearer the equator. The blue whale can take in up to 90 times as much energy as it expends, allowing it to build up considerable energy reserves.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19841-blue-whale-feeding-methods-are-ultraefficient.html Michael Marhsall.

Because krill move, blue whales typically feed at depths of more than {{convert|100|m|ft}} during the day and only surface-feed at night. Dive times are typically 10&nbsp;minutes when feeding, though dives of up to 20&nbsp;minutes are common. The longest recorded dive is 36&nbsp;minutes.{{Citation needed|reason=These claims had an inline citation of "Sears 1998" with no corresponding full citation, nor could any be found: a search of the internet and the literature only yielded theses and studies citing, at longest, a physiological dive duration limit of 21 minutes; in that light, these claims seem unusual. They should be rewritten if verifiable source material is not provided.|date=August 2013}} The whale feeds by lunging forward at groups of krill, taking the animals and a large quantity of water into its mouth. The water is then squeezed out through the baleen plates by pressure from the ventral pouch and tongue. Once the mouth is clear of water, the remaining krill, unable to pass through the plates, are swallowed. The blue whale also incidentally consumes small fish, crustaceans and squid caught up with krill.<ref>{{cite journal

As this phenomenon has not been seen in any other populations, researchers believe it may be unique to the ''B. m. brevicauda'' (pygmy) subspecies.

Because of disputes with the local fishermen, the last whaling station in Finnmark was closed down in 1904.

Soon, blue whales were being hunted off Iceland (1883), the Faroe Islands (1894), [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] (1898), and [[Spitsbergen]] (1903). In 1904<U+2013>05 the first blue whales were taken off [[South Georgia]]. By 1925, with the advent of the stern slipway in factory ships and the use of steam-driven whale catchers, the catch of blue whales, and baleen whales as a whole, in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic began to increase dramatically. In the 1930<U+2013>31 season, these ships caught 29,400 blue whales in the Antarctic alone. By the end of [[World War II]], populations had been significantly depleted, and, in 1946, the first quotas restricting international trade in whales were introduced, but they were ineffective because of the lack of differentiation between species. Rare species could be hunted on an equal footing with those found in relative abundance.

[[Arthur C. Clarke]], in his 1962 book ''Profiles of the Future'', was the first prominent [[intellectual]] to call attention to the plight of the blue whale. He mentioned its large brain and said, "we do not know the true nature of the entity we are destroying."<ref>[[Arthur C. Clarke|Clarke, Arthur C.]] ''Profiles of the Future; an Inquiry into the Limits of the Possible''. New York: Harper & Row, 1962</ref>

Since the introduction of the whaling ban, studies have failed to ascertain whether the [[conservation reliant species|conservation reliant]] global blue whale population is increasing or remaining stable. In the Antarctic, best estimates show a significant increase at 7.3% per year since the end of illegal Soviet whaling, but numbers remain at under 1% of their original levels.<ref name=Ant/> It has also been suggested that Icelandic and Californian populations are increasing but these increases are not statistically significant. The total world population was estimated to be between 5,000 and 12,000 in 2002, although there are high levels of uncertainty in available estimates for many areas.<ref name=pop/>

The [[IUCN Red List]] counts the blue whale as "endangered" as it has since the list's inception. In the United States, the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] lists them as endangered under the [[Endangered Species Act]].<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/laws/esa/

}}</ref> The largest known concentration, consisting of about 2,800 individuals, is the northeast Pacific population of the northern blue whale (''B. m. musculus'') subspecies that ranges from [[Alaska]] to [[Costa Rica]], but is most commonly seen from California in summer.<ref>Blue Whale (''Balaenoptera musculus''): Eastern North Pacific Stock (''NOAA Stock Reports'', 2009), p. 178.</ref> Infrequently, this population visits the northwest Pacific between [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] and the northern tip of Japan.

In the North Atlantic, two stocks of ''B. m. musculus'' are recognised. The first is found off [[Greenland]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], Nova Scotia and the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]]. This group is estimated to total about 500. The second, more easterly group is spotted from the [[Azores]] in spring to Iceland in July and August; it is presumed the whales follow the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] between the two volcanic islands. Beyond Iceland, blue whales have been spotted as far north as [[Spitsbergen]] and [[Jan Mayen]], though such sightings are rare. Scientists do not know where these whales spend their winters. The total North Atlantic population is estimated to be between 600 and 1,500.

In the Southern Hemisphere, there appear to be two distinct subspecies, ''B. m. intermedia'', the Antarctic blue whale, and the little-studied pygmy blue whale, ''B. m. brevicauda'', found in Indian Ocean waters. The most recent surveys (midpoint 1998) provided an estimate of 2,280 blue whales in the Antarctic<ref>{{cite journal

A fourth subspecies, ''B. m. indica'', was identified by [[Edward Blyth|Blyth]] in 1859 in the northern Indian Ocean, but difficulties in identifying distinguishing features for this subspecies led to it being used as a synonym for ''B. m. brevicauda'', the pygmy blue whale. Records for Soviet catches seem to indicate that the female adult size is closer to that of the Pygmy Blue than ''B. m. musculus'', although the populations of ''B. m. indica'' and ''B. m. brevicauda'' appear to be discrete, and the breeding seasons differ by almost six months.<ref name = SHDistribution>{{cite journal

Migratory patterns of these subspecies are not well known. For example, pygmy blue whales have been recorded in the northern Indian Ocean ([[Oman]], Maldives and [[Sri Lanka]]), where they may form a distinct resident population.<ref name= SHDistribution /> In addition, the population of blue whales occurring off [[Chile]] and [[Peru]] may also be a distinct population. Some Antarctic blue whales approach the eastern South Atlantic coast in winter, and occasionally, their vocalizations are heard off Peru, Western Australia, and in the northern Indian Ocean.<ref name= SHDistribution /> In Chile, the [[Cetacean Conservation Center]], with support from the [[Chilean Navy]], is undertaking extensive research and conservation work on a recently discovered feeding aggregation of the species off the coast of [[Chiloe Island]] in the [[Gulf of Corcovado]], where 326 blue whales were spotted in 2007.<ref>{{cite web

The [[Natural History Museum, London#Major specimens and exhibits|Natural History Museum]] in London contains a famous mounted skeleton and life-size model of a blue whale, which were both the first of their kind in the world, but have since been replicated at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]. Similarly, the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City has a full-size model in its Milstein Family Hall of Ocean Life. A juvenile blue whale skeleton is installed at the [[New Bedford Whaling Museum]] in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]].

The [[Aquarium of the Pacific]] in [[Long Beach, California]] features a life-size model of a mother blue whale with her calf suspended from the ceiling of its main hall.<ref>{{cite web

The Museum of Natural History in Gothenburg, Sweden contains the only stuffed blue whale in the world. There one can also find the skeleton of the whale mounted beside the whale.

The [[Melbourne Museum]] features a skeleton of the [[pygmy blue whale]].

The [[North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] features a mounted skeleton of a blue whale which visitors can view from both the first and second floors.
