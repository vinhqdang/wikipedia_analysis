'''Terrance Stanley "Terry" Fox''', {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Canada|CC]], [[Order of the Dogwood|OD]]}} (July 28, 1958 <U+2013> June 28, 1981) was a Canadian [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]], athlete, and [[cancer research]] activist. In 1980, as a one-legged amputee, he embarked on a cross-Canada run to raise money and awareness for cancer research. Though the spread of his cancer forced him to end his quest after 143 days and {{convert|5280|km|mi}}, and ultimately cost him his life, his determination and example created a lasting, worldwide legacy. The annual [[Terry Fox Run]], first held in 1981, has grown to involve millions of participants in over 60 countries and is now the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research; over [[Canadian Dollar|C$]]500 million has been raised in his name.

Fox was a distance runner and [[basketball]] player for his [[Port Coquitlam]], [[British Columbia]] high school and [[Simon Fraser University]].  His right leg was amputated in 1977 after he was diagnosed with [[osteosarcoma]], though he continued to run using an artificial leg. He also played [[wheelchair basketball]] in Vancouver, winning three national championships.

In 1980, he began the Marathon of Hope, a cross-country run to raise money for cancer research. Fox hoped to raise one dollar for each of Canada's 24 million people. He started with little fanfare from [[St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] in April and ran the equivalent of a full [[marathon]] every day. Fox had become a national star by the time he reached [[Ontario]]; he made numerous public appearances with businessmen, athletes, and politicians in his efforts to raise money for research. He was forced to end his run outside of [[Thunder Bay]] when the cancer spread to his lungs. His hopes of overcoming the disease and completing his marathon ended when he died nine months later. 
 
Fox was the youngest person ever named a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]], the nation's highest civilian award. He won the 1980 [[Lou Marsh Award]] as the nation's top sportsman and was named Canada's [[Canadian Newsmaker of the Year|Newsmaker of the Year]] in both 1980 and 1981.  Considered a national hero, he has had many buildings, roads and parks named in his honour across the country.

==Early life and cancer==
Fox was born July 28, 1958 in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]] to Rolly and Betty Fox. Rolly was a switchman for the [[Canadian National Railway]].<ref name="MtlGazette42880">{{cite news |last=Scrivener |first=Leslie |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=kBQyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aaQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1162,4206618 |title=Terry's running for the cancer society |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |date=1980-04-28 |accessdate=2010-02-25 |page=21}}</ref>  Terry had an elder brother, Fred, a younger brother, Darrel and a younger sister, Judith.<ref name="Greatest Canadian">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/greatest/top_ten/nominee/fox-terry.html |title=The Greatest Canadian: Terry Fox |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2010-02-25}}</ref> His family moved to [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], [[British Columbia]] in 1966, then settled in [[Port Coquitlam, British Columbia|Port Coquitlam]] in 1968.<ref name="Greatest Canadian" />  His parents were dedicated to their family, and his mother was especially protective of her children; it was through her that Fox developed his stubborn dedication to whatever task he committed to do.<ref name="Scrivener13">Scrivener, 2000, pp. 13<U+2013>14</ref>  His father recalled that he was extremely competitive, noting that Terry hated to lose so much that he would continue at any activity until he succeeded.<ref name=Inwood>{{cite news |first=Damian |last=Inwood |title=Terry  Fox: 25 years; Celebrating his dream: a 12-page special section honouring the 25th Annual Terry Fox Run |newspaper=Vancouver Province |date=2005-09-18}}</ref>

He was an enthusiastic athlete, playing [[soccer]], [[Rugby football|rugby]] and [[baseball]] as a child.<ref name="Scrivener16">Scrivener, 2000, pp. 16<U+2013>17</ref> His passion was for [[basketball]] and though he stood only five feet tall and was a poor player at the time, Fox sought to make his school team in grade eight. His physical education teacher and basketball coach at Mary Hill Junior High School felt he was better suited to be a distance runner and encouraged him to take up the sport.  Fox had no desire for cross-country running, but took it up because he respected and wanted to please his coach.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 18</ref> He was determined to continue playing basketball, even if he was the last substitute on the team.  Fox played only one minute in his grade eight season but dedicated his summers to improving his play. He became a regular player in grade nine and earned a starting position in grade ten.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, pp. 19<U+2013>20</ref> In grade 12, he won his high school's athlete of the year award jointly with his best friend Doug Alward.<ref name="Greatest Canadian" /> 

Initially unsure if he wanted to go to university, Fox's mother convinced him to enroll at [[Simon Fraser University]], where he studied [[kinesiology]] as a stepping stone to becoming a physical education teacher.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 23</ref>  He tried out for the junior varsity basketball team, earning a spot ahead of more talented players due to his determination.<ref name="Greatest Canadian" />

On November 12, 1976, as Fox was driving home to Port Coquitlam, he became distracted by nearby bridge construction, and crashed into the back of a pickup truck.  While his car was left undriveable, Fox emerged with only a sore right knee. He again felt pain in December, but chose to ignore it until the end of basketball season.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 25</ref> By March 1977, the pain had intensified and he finally went to hospital, where he was diagnosed with [[osteosarcoma]], a form of cancer that often starts near the knees.<ref name="Greatest Canadian" /> Fox believed his car accident weakened his knee and left it vulnerable to the disease, though his doctors argued there was no connection.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 27</ref> He was told that his leg had to be amputated, he would require [[chemotherapy]] treatment, and that recent medical advances meant he had a 50 percent chance of survival. Fox learned that two years before the figure would have been only 15 percent; the improvement in survival rates impressed on him the value of cancer research.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 30</ref>

With the help of an artificial leg, Fox was walking three weeks after the amputation.<ref name="Greatest Canadian" /> He then progressed to playing golf with his father.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 36</ref> Doctors were impressed with Fox's positive outlook, stating it contributed to his rapid recovery.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 35</ref> He endured sixteen months of chemotherapy and found the time he spent in the British Columbia Cancer Control Agency facility difficult as he watched fellow cancer patients suffer and die from the disease.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, pp. 37<U+2013>38</ref> Fox ended his treatment with new purpose: he felt he owed his survival to medical advances and wished to live his life in a way that would help others find courage.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 41</ref>

In the summer of 1977 [[Rick Hansen]], working with the Canadian Wheelchair Sports Association, invited Fox to try out for his [[wheelchair basketball]] team.<ref>{{cite news |last=Edwards |first=Peter |title=Man in Motion set to honour pal Terry Fox |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=1987-01-03 |page=A13}}</ref> Although he was undergoing chemotherapy treatments at the time, Fox's energy impressed Hansen.<ref name="Greatest Canadian" />  Less than two months after learning how to play the sport, Fox was named a member of the team for the national championship in Edmonton.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 45</ref> He won three national titles with the team,<ref name="Greatest Canadian" /> and was named an all-star by the North American Wheelchair Basketball Association in 1980.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 47</ref>

==Marathon of Hope==
[[File:Marathon of Hope path.png|thumb|right|Fox's path across eastern Canada.  He began at St. John's on the east coast and ran west.|alt= refer to caption]]
The night before his cancer surgery, Fox had been given an article about [[Dick Traum]], the first amputee to complete the [[New York Marathon]].<ref name="Greatest Canadian" /> The article inspired him; he embarked on a 14-month training program, telling his family he planned to compete in a marathon himself.<ref name="MtlGazette42880" />  In private, he devised a more extensive plan. His hospital experiences had made Fox angry at how little money was dedicated to cancer research in Canada. He intended to run the length of Canada in the hope of increasing cancer awareness, a goal he had initially only divulged to his friend Doug Alward.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 58</ref>

Fox ran with an unusual gait, as he was required to hop-step on his good leg due to the extra time the springs in his artificial leg required to reset after each step.<ref name="MtlGazette62380">{{cite news |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=2FQ0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=abkFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3901,1065955 |title=Runner wants to cross nation on one leg |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |date=1980-06-23 |accessdate=2010-02-26 |page=1}}</ref>  He found the training painful as the additional pressure he had to place on both his good leg and his stump led to bone bruises, blisters and intense pain.  Fox found that after about 20 minutes of each run, he crossed a pain threshold and the run became easier.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 57</ref>

In August 1979, Fox competed in a marathon in [[Prince George, British Columbia]]. He finished in last place, ten minutes behind everyone else, but his effort was met with tears and applause from the other participants.<ref name="Greatest Canadian" />  Following the marathon, he revealed his full plan to his family.<ref>Coupland, 2005, p. 29</ref> His mother discouraged him, angering Fox, though she later came to support the project. She recalled, "He said, 'I thought you'd be one of the first persons to believe in me.' And I wasn't. I was the first person who let him down."<ref name=maclean/> Fox initially hoped to raise $1&nbsp;million,<ref name=maclean>{{cite news |last=MacQueen |first=Ken |url=http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=M1ARTM0012749 |title=25th anniversary of Terry Fox's Marathon of Hope |newspaper=Macleans Magazine |publisher=Historica-Dominion Institute of Canada |date=2005-04-04 |accessdate=2010-03-20}}</ref> but later sought to raise $1 for each of Canada's 24 million people.<ref name="CBCLegacy">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/fox_terry/ |title=Terry Fox's legacy of hope |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2006-06-27 |accessdate=2010-02-25}}</ref>

===Preparation===
On October 15, 1979, Fox sent a letter to the [[Canadian Cancer Society]] in which he announced his goal and appealed for funding. He stated that he would "conquer" his disability, and promised to complete his run, even if he had to "crawl every last mile". Explaining why he wanted to raise money for research, Fox described his personal experience of cancer treatment:

{{quote|I soon realized that that would only be half my quest, for as I went through the 16 months of the physically and emotionally draining ordeal of chemotherapy, I was rudely awakened by the feelings that surrounded and coursed through the cancer clinic. There were faces with the brave smiles, and the ones who had given up smiling. There were feelings of hopeful denial, and the feelings of despair. My quest would not be a selfish one. I could not leave knowing these faces and feelings would still exist, even though I would be set free from mine. Somewhere the hurting must stop....and I was determined to take myself to the limit for this cause.<ref name=Inwood/>}}

[[File:Terry Fox Denkmal.jpg|thumb|left|Terry Fox statue in [[Beacon Hill Park]], Victoria, British Columbia|alt= Statue of Fox running set on a plinth engraved with "Somewhere the hurting must stop..."  ]]
Fox made no promises that his efforts would lead to a cure for cancer, but he closed his letter with the statement: "I believe in miracles. I have to."<ref name=Inwood/> The Cancer Society was skeptical of his dedication, but agreed to support Fox once he had acquired sponsors, and requested he get a medical certificate from a heart specialist stating that he was fit to attempt the run.  Fox was diagnosed with [[left ventricular hypertrophy]] <U+2014> an enlarged heart <U+2014> a condition commonly associated with athletes.  Doctors warned Fox of the potential risks he faced, though they did not consider his condition a significant concern.  They endorsed his participation when he promised that he would stop immediately if he began to experience any heart problems.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, pp. 69<U+2013>70</ref>

A second letter was sent to several corporations seeking donations for a vehicle, running shoes and to cover the other costs of the run.<ref name="Scrivener63">Scrivener, 2000, p. 63</ref> Fox sent other letters asking for grants to buy a running leg. He observed that while he was grateful to be alive following his cancer treatment, "I remember promising myself that, should I live, I would rise up to meet this new challenge [of fundraising for cancer research] face to face and prove myself worthy of life, something too many people take for granted."<ref name="Scrivener63" /> The [[Ford Motor Company]] donated a camper van,<ref name="Scrivener13" /> while [[Imperial Oil]] contributed fuel, and [[Adidas]] his running shoes.<ref name="Murphy33">Murphy, 2005, p.  33</ref>  Fox turned away any company that requested he endorse their products and refused any donation that carried conditions as he insisted that nobody was to profit from his run.<ref name="Scrivener13" />

===Trek across Canada===
The Marathon began on April 12, 1980 when Fox dipped his right leg in the Atlantic Ocean near [[St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], and filled two large bottles with ocean water. He intended to keep one as a souvenir and pour the other one into the Pacific Ocean upon completing his journey at [[Victoria, British Columbia]].<ref name="CBCLegacy" />  Fox was supported on his run by Doug Alward, who drove the van and cooked meals.<ref name="Murphy33" />  

Fox was met with gale force winds, heavy rain and a snowstorm in the first days of his run.<ref name="MtlGazette42880" /> He was initially disappointed with the reception he received, but was heartened upon arriving in [[Channel-Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador|Port aux Basques,  Newfoundland]] where the town's 10,000 residents presented him with a donation of over $10,000.<ref name="Murphy33" /> Throughout the trip, Fox frequently expressed his anger and frustration to those he saw as impeding the run, and he fought regularly with Alward. By the time they reached [[Nova Scotia]], they were barely on speaking terms, and it was arranged that Fox's fun, lively brother Darrell, then 17, would join them as a buffer.<ref name=maclean/> Fox left the [[Maritimes]] on June 10 and faced new challenges entering [[Quebec]] due to his group's inability to speak French,<ref name="Scrivener232">Scrivener, 2000,  p. 232</ref> and from drivers who continually forced him off the road.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 97</ref>  Fox arrived in [[Montreal]] on June 22, one-third of the way through his {{convert|8000|km|mi}} journey, having collected over $200,000 in donations.<ref name="MtlGazette62380" /> Convinced by the Canadian Cancer Society that arriving in [[Ottawa]] for [[Canada Day]] would aid fundraising efforts, he remained in Montreal for a few extra days.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 97</ref>

Fox crossed into Ontario at the town of [[Hawkesbury, Ontario|Hawkesbury]] on the last Saturday in June. He was met by a brass band and thousands of residents who lined the streets to cheer him on while the [[Ontario Provincial Police]] gave him an escort throughout the province.<ref name="Murphy34">Murphy, 2005, p. 34</ref> Despite the sweltering heat of summer, he continued to run {{convert|26|mi|km}} per day.<ref name="Scrivener232" /> On arrival in [[Ottawa]], Fox met [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] and [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Edward Schreyer|Ed Schreyer]] and was the guest of honour at numerous sporting events in the city.<ref name="Murphy34" />  In front of 16,000 fans, he performed a ceremonial kickoff at a [[Canadian Football League]] game and was given a standing ovation.  Fox's journal reflected his growing excitement at the reception he had received as he began to understand how deeply moved Canadians were by his efforts.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 118</ref>

A crowd of 10,000 people met Fox in [[Toronto]], where he was honoured in [[Nathan Phillips Square]].  As he ran to the square, he was joined on the road by many people, including [[National Hockey League]] star [[Darryl Sittler]], who presented Fox with his 1980 All-Star Game jersey. The Cancer Society estimated it collected $100,000 in donations that day alone.<ref name="Greatest Canadian" /> As he continued through southern Ontario, he was met by [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]r [[Bobby Orr]] who presented him with a cheque for $25,000.  Fox considered meeting Orr the highlight of his journey.<ref  name="Greatest Canadian" />

As Fox's fame grew, the Cancer Society scheduled him to attend more functions and give more speeches.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 123</ref> Fox attempted to accommodate any request that he believed would raise money, no matter how far out of his way it took him.<ref>Coupland, 2005, p. 91</ref> He bristled, however, at what he felt were media intrusions into his personal life, for example when the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' reported that he had gone on a date.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 130</ref>  Fox was left unsure of who he could trust in the media after negative articles began to emerge, including one by the ''[[Globe and Mail]]'' that characterized him as a "tyrannical brother" who verbally abused Darryl and claimed he was running because he held a grudge against a doctor who had misdiagnosed his condition, allegations he referred to as "trash".<ref name="Scrivener144" />

The physical demands of running a marathon every day took its toll on Fox's body. Apart from the rest days in Montreal taken at the request of the Cancer Society, he refused to take a day off, even on his 22nd birthday.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 138</ref>  He frequently suffered shin splints and an inflamed knee.  He developed cysts on his stump and experienced dizzy spells.<ref>Coupland, 2005, p. 47</ref>  At one point, he suffered a soreness in his ankle that would not go away.  Although he feared he had acquired a stress fracture, he ran for three more days before seeking medical attention, and was then relieved to learn it was [[tendonitis]] and could be treated with painkillers.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 147</ref>  Fox rejected calls for him to seek regular medical checkups,<ref>{{cite news |last=Harper |first=Tim |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=EaMyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ie4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=980,3731630 |title=Medical check 'stupid', cancer marathoner scoffs |newspaper=Ottawa Citizen |date=1980-07-30 |accessdate=2010-02-28 |page=1}}</ref> and dismissed suggestions he was risking his future health.<ref name="Scrivener144">Scrivener, 2000, p. 144</ref>

In spite of his immense recuperative capacity,<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 133</ref> Fox found that by late August he was exhausted before he began his day's run.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 150</ref> On September 1, outside of Thunder Bay, he was forced to stop briefly after he suffered an intense coughing fit and experienced pains in his chest.  Unsure of what else to do, he resumed running as the crowds along the highway shouted out their encouragement.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, pp. 153<U+2013>154</ref> A few miles later, short of breath and with continued chest pain, he asked Alward to drive him to a hospital. He feared immediately that he had run his last mile.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 155</ref> The next day, Fox held a tearful press conference during which he announced that his cancer had returned and spread to his lungs. He was forced to end his run after 143 days and {{convert|5280|km|mi}}.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=uTMyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qaQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1332,393909 |title=Weeping amputee ends Canada run: 'It's cancer again' |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |date=1980-09-03 |accessdate=2010-02-28 |page=1}}</ref> Fox refused offers to complete the run in his stead, stating that he wanted to complete his marathon himself.<ref name="Greatest Canadian" />

===National response===

Fox had raised $1.7 million by the time he was forced to abandon the Marathon.  He realized that the nation was about to see the consequences of the disease, and hoped that this might lead to greater generosity.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 163</ref> A week after his run ended, the [[CTV Television Network]] organized a nationwide [[telethon]] in support of Fox and the Canadian Cancer Society.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=vTMyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qaQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2345%2C3013106 |title=TV show raises $9 million for cancer |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |date=1980-09-08 |page=1 |accessdate=2010-02-28}}</ref> Supported by Canadian and international celebrities, the five-hour event raised $10.5 million.<ref name="Greatest Canadian" /> Among the donations were $1 million each by the governments of British Columbia and Ontario, the former to create a new research institute to be founded in Fox's name, and the latter an endowment given to the Ontario Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 168</ref>  Donations continued throughout the winter, and by the following April, over $23 million had been raised in Fox's name.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=-CMiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-IcFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1251,3421230 |title=Fox's dream raised $23.4 million |newspaper=Tri-City Herald |date=1981-04-12 |accessdate=2010-02-28 |page=44}}</ref>

One of Fox's earliest supporters was [[Isadore Sharp]], founder of the [[Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts|Four Seasons Hotels]].

A second movie, titled ''[[Terry (film)|Terry]]'', focused on the Marathon of Hope, was produced by the [[CTV television network]] in 2005. Fox was portrayed by [[Shawn Ashmore]]. He is not an amputee; digital editing was used to superimpose a prosthesis over his real leg. The film was endorsed by Fox's family, and portrayed his attitude more positively than the first movie.<ref name="MacleansFilm" /> Canadian [[National Basketball Association]] star [[Steve Nash]], who himself was inspired by Fox when he was a child, directed a 2010 documentary ''Into the Wind'', which will be aired on [[ESPN]] as part of its [[30 for 30]] series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/westcoastnews/story.html?id=006545a4-a2d6-4867-9adf-d60125176f14 |title=Nash to make film about Terry Fox |newspaper=Vancouver Sun |date=2008-07-12 |accessdate=2010-03-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://30for30.espn.com/film/into-the-wind.html |title=Into the Wind |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2010-03-06}}</ref>
