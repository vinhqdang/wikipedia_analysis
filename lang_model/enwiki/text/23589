===Chief of Defence staff===
Fonseka was appointed Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) by President Rajapaksa effective 15 July 2009. He was the first person appointed CDS under the newly approved Chief of Defence Staff Act, which was supposed to give the CDS more responsibilities in coordinating the armed forces.

==Politics==

===Post-war politics===
There were newspaper reports published about General Fonseka entering politics after the war victory, beginning in August 2009. One of the articles explains it as follows, "General Fonseka launches political campaign <U+2013> I will make a supreme sacrifice to defend my land against the politicos who ever they may be joining hands with India. Now we have a daunting task to protect our motherland from India".<ref>[http://www.lankanewspapers.com/news/2009/8/46939_space.html General Fonseka launches political campaign].

Fonseka entering politics was a debate even during the war against LTTE.<ref>[http://transcurrents.com/tc/2008/12/post_125.html Is Lt.Gen Sarath Fonseka nurturing a Political Ambition After Retirement?]</ref>

Gen. Fonseka was installed as the common candidate by a coalition of political parties mainly United National Party (UNP) and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). Gen. Fonseka however declared himself as a non party candidate.

With support of UNP and JVP Fonseka claimed that he himself defeated the LTTE. {{Disputed|date=March 2010}} Immediately after declaration that Fonseka was ready for candidacy, President Rajapakse called for new presidential election two years before expiration of his term.

[[File:Sarath Fonseka addressing the media.jpg|thumb|320px|left|a|Sarath Fonseka addressing media after 2010 election]]Gen. Fonseka, UNP and JVP led a fierce battle against President Rajapakse. They claimed that Gen Fonseka was the real hero who won the war against LTTE and Fonseka government was ready for good governance along with the support of all the minorities, eliminate prevailing corruption under Mahinda Rajapaka government and also promised a massive salary increase for public servants which had been denied thus far. They also promised to change the constitution to remove executive powers from the presidency and transfer such powers to the parliament. Further they promised to establish the 17 amendment to authorise independent commissions as a measure to counter the ongoing mishandling of public money.<ref>[http://indi.ca/2010/01/sarath-fonsekas-election-manifesto/ Sarath Fonseka<U+2019>s Election Manifesto]. indi.ca (2010-01-07). Retrieved on 2011-03-23.</ref>

Fonseka suffered a number of setbacks in his election campaign. In December 2009, A news item was published in local newspaper "Sunday Leader" quoting Sarath Fonseka saying that during the final few days of the war against LTTE, Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapakse (who is a brother of the President) gave orders to the army senior officers to execute LTTE cadres who surrendered to the Army.<ref>[http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2009/12/13/%E2%80%9Cgota-ordered-them-to-be-shot%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-general-sarath-fonseka/ <U+201C>Gota Ordered Them To Be Shot<U+201D> <U+2013> General Sarath Fonseka | The Sunday Leader]. Thesundayleader.lk (2009-12-13). Retrieved on 2011-03-23.</ref> Due to the massive publicity given in the state media, this statement was taken by the whole country as betrayal of army officers by the retired army commander himself.<ref>[http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2010/01/24/rajapaksa-gets-astounding-98-of-time-on-state-media/ Rajapaksa Gets Astounding 98% Of Time On State Media | The Sunday Leader]. Thesundayleader.lk (2010-01-24). Retrieved on 2011-03-23.</ref> Although Gen. Fonseka later issued a statement saying that his original statement has been published by the Sunday Leader out of context, many analysts say that Fonseka lost the election from that moment.<ref>http://lankainfoonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=32:fonseka-denies-sunday-leader-report&catid=3:news&Itemid=1</ref>

Meanwhile, in the next attempt government put some evidence before public that Gen Fonseka was corrupt while he was the commander of the Sri Lanka Army. There was evidence that he removed the tender board chairman from the office and he himself became the chairman only to offer all the tenders to a company owned by his son-in-law. Adding fuel to the fire, one of his close friends living in Oklahoma USA "Upul Illangamge" spilled the beans by disclosing to the media in a press conference how the company was formed, registered in USA and Fonseka's son-in-law sold 3&nbsp;million rupees worth equipment necessary for the war during the final three years of the war. Fonska claimed that the company referred in the accusation has no connection to his son-in-laws company although both companies share one name: Hicorp. But this allegation was on all public & state media supporting the government day and night and it had been used as a mean of discredit his reputation and attempts were also made to label him as a traitor by key spokespeople in the government.

Then Sri Lanka's Tamil political party faithful to LTTE- Tamil National Alliance (TNA) agreed to support Sarath Fonseka in the Presidential Election after having several discussions with both Mahinda Rajapakse and Gen. Sarath Fonseka. Then government disclosed a secret agreement between TNA and Gen Fonseka in which Fonseka had promised merger of North and East provinces and an autonomous status for Tamils in return for the support of the north and east Tamil population in the Presidential election.But opposition leaders prove that agreement was a fake one with fake signatures adapted by another resources.But some Sinhalese reacted with anger to this agreement since the army fought 30 year old bloody war against LTTE only to reject similar autonomous state "Ealam" claimed by the LTTE. Also opposition revealed a secret written agreement between Mahinda Rajapaksa and EPDP Leader [[Douglas Devananda]] who was a Tamil politician faithful to Rajapakse.<ref>[http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2009/12/20/the-mahinda-rajapakse-douglas-devananda-agreement/ The Mahinda Rajapakse-Douglas Devananda Agreement: | The Sunday Leader].

Sarath Fonseka however sincerely expected that he was set for a massive win on 26 January 2010. There were reports that say that he intended to arrest President Mahinda Rajapakse and immediately execute Gotabaya Rajapakse and Basil Rajapakse(two brothers of the president). He booked 70 rooms of a five star hotel some hundred metres away from the President's House for the night of 26 January 2010. {{Disputed|date=March 2010}} State Media reports say that a large number (some 400) of deserted army soldiers spent the night with Gen Fonseka at the hotel to enjoy the election results. It was then learned that the whole allegation was false! because the government arrested 9 persons that official body guards of Gen. Sarath Fonseka that provided for his personal security by Army.<ref>[http://www.lankatruth.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4624:a-senior-army-officer-netted-in-on-wild-card-charges&catid=35:local&Itemid=62 A senior army officer netted in on wild card charges].

Later he stated in a press conference that he does not intend to leave the country, rather would stay with the people who voted him to see the justice is established.

On 28 January 2010 CID began its new investigations on claims made by several ministers of Rajapakse government that Fonseka was planning a coup to remove Rajapakse in case of close election results on 26 January In connection with this investigation, a media institution "Lanka" run by JVP who helped Fonseka during presidential election was sealed on 30 January 2010 by the CID with a court order.

Sri Lanka Army has arrested Sarath Fonseka for committing military offences on 8 February 2010.

===Arrest===

The military tribunal in which the case was heard has been challenged on multiple issues including the [http://www.groundreport.com/World/General-Fonsekas-Lawyers-To-Challenge-His-Court-Ma/2919678 suitability and qualifications of the judges] and the hearing of the case during an official holiday period of lawyers (9 August to 13th, 2010), and his lawyers were not present. Furthermore, because the witnesses were summoned during the aforementioned period, the lawyers of the accused never had a chance to interrogate the witnesses.

Later,on 14 [[August 2010]] the President authorised 1st court martial to strip Sarath Fonseka of all Military ranks. It is reported that an appeal is to be made to the high court soon.
