'''Ants''' are [[Eusociality|eusocial]] [[insect]]s of the family '''Formicidae''' {{IPAc-en|f|<U+0254>r|<U+02C8>|m|<U+026A>|s|<U+0268>|d|i<U+02D0>}} and, along with the related [[wasp]]s and [[bee]]s, belong to the order [[Hymenoptera]]. Ants [[evolution|evolved]] from wasp-like ancestors in the mid-[[Cretaceous]] period between 110 and 130&nbsp;million years ago and [[Evolutionary radiation|diversified]] after the rise of [[flowering plant]]s. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 [[List of ant genera (alphabetical)|species]] have been classified.<ref>{{cite web

Ants form [[Ant colony|colonies]] that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies that may occupy large territories and consist of millions of individuals. Larger colonies consist mostly of sterile, wingless females forming castes of "workers", "soldiers", or other specialised groups. Nearly all ant colonies also have some fertile males called "drones" and one or more fertile females called "[[Queen ant|queens]]". The colonies are described as [[superorganism]]s because the ants appear to operate as a unified entity, collectively working together to support the colony.<ref>{{cite book|author=Oster GF, Wilson EO|year=1978|title=Caste and ecology in the social insects|publisher=Princeton University Press, Princeton|pages=21<U+2013>22|isbn=0-691-02361-1}}</ref><ref name="Flannery2011">{{cite book|last=Flannery|first=Tim|title=A Natural History of the Planet|year=2011|publisher=[[Grove/Atlantic, Inc.]]|isbn=9780802195609|page=79}}</ref>

Ants have colonised almost every landmass on [[Earth]]. The only places lacking indigenous ants are [[Antarctica]] and a few remote or inhospitable islands. Ants thrive in most ecosystems and may form 15<U+2013>25% of the [[terrestrial animal]] [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]].<ref name="schultz"/> Their success in so many environments has been attributed to their social organisation and their ability to modify habitats, tap resources, and defend themselves. Their long [[co-evolution]] with other species has led to [[mimicry|mimetic]], [[commensalism|commensal]], [[parasitism|parasitic]], and [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationships.<ref name=TheAntsRelations>H<U+00F6>lldobler & Wilson (1990), p. 471</ref>

Ant societies have [[division of labour]], communication between individuals, and an ability to [[Problem solving|solve complex problems]].<ref name="SANdisk"/> These parallels with [[Civilization|human societies]] have long been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication, and rituals. Some species are valued in their role as [[biological pest control]] agents.<ref name="HolldoblerWilsonAnts3"/> Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they can damage crops and invade buildings. Some species, such as the [[red imported fire ant]] (''Solenopsis invicta''), are regarded as [[invasive species]], establishing themselves in areas where they have been introduced accidentally.<ref name="pests"/>

==Etymology==
The word "ant" is derived from ''{{lang|enm|ante}}'', ''{{lang|enm|emete}}'' of [[Middle English]] which are derived from ''{{lang|ang|<U+01E3>mette}}'' of [[Old English]], and is related to the dialectal [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''{{lang|nl|emt}}'' and the [[Old High German]] ''{{lang|goh|<U+0101>meiza}}'', hence the modern [[German language|German]] ''{{lang|de|Ameise}}''. All of these words come from West Germanic ''*{{lang|gmw|<U+0113>maitij<U+01ED>}}'', and the original meaning of the word was "the biter" (from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*{{lang|gem|ai-}}'', "off, away" + ''*{{lang|gem|mait-}}'' "cut").<ref>{{cite web

The family Formicidae belongs to the order [[Hymenoptera]], which also includes [[sawfly|sawflies]], [[bee]]s, and [[wasp]]s. Ants evolved from a lineage within the [[Aculeata|aculeate]] wasps, and a 2013 study suggests they are a sister group of the [[Apoidea]].<ref name=phylo /> In 1966, [[E. O. Wilson]] and his colleagues identified the [[fossil]] remains of an ant (''[[Sphecomyrma]]'') that lived in the Cretaceous period. The specimen, trapped in amber [[absolute dating|dating]] back to around 92&nbsp;million years ago, has features found in some wasps, but not found in modern ants.<ref>{{cite journal

During the Cretaceous period, a few species of primitive ants ranged widely on the [[Laurasia]]n supercontinent (the Northern Hemisphere). They were scarce in comparison to the populations of other insects, representing only about 1% of the entire insect population. Ants became dominant after [[adaptive radiation]] at the beginning of the [[Paleogene period]]. By the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]], ants had come to represent 20<U+2013>40% of all insects found in major fossil deposits. Of the species that lived in the [[Eocene]] epoch, around one in 10 genera survive to the present. Genera surviving today comprise 56% of the genera in [[Baltic amber]] fossils (early Oligocene), and 92% of the genera in [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] amber fossils (apparently early Miocene).<ref name="grimaldi2001"/><ref name=TheAntEvo>H<U+00F6>lldobler & Wilson (1990), pp. 23<U+2013>24</ref>

[[Termite]]s, although sometimes called 'white ants', are not ants. They belong to the sub-order [[Isoptera]] within order [[Blattodea]]. Termites are more closely related to [[cockroach]]es and [[mantid]]s. Termites are [[eusociality|eusocial]], but differ greatly in the genetics of reproduction. The similarity of their social structure to that of ants is attributed to [[convergent evolution]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Thorne|first=Barbara L|year=1997|title=Evolution of eusociality in termites|journal=Annu.

==Morphology==
Ants are distinct in their [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] from other insects in having elbowed [[antenna (biology)|antennae]], [[metapleural gland]]s, and a strong constriction of their second [[Abdomen|abdominal]] segment into a node-like [[petiole (insect anatomy)|petiole]]. The head, [[mesosoma]], and [[metasoma]] are the three distinct body segments. The petiole forms a narrow waist between their mesosoma ([[Thorax (insect anatomy)|thorax]] plus the first abdominal segment, which is fused to it) and [[gaster (insect anatomy)|gaster]] (abdomen less the abdominal segments in the petiole). The petiole may be formed by one or two nodes (the second alone, or the second and third abdominal segments).<ref>Borror, Triplehorn & Delong (1989), p. 737</ref>

Like other insects, ants have an [[exoskeleton]], an external covering that provides a protective casing around the body and a point of attachment for muscles, in contrast to the internal skeletons of humans and other [[vertebrate]]s. Insects do not have lungs; oxygen and other gases such as [[carbon dioxide]] pass through their exoskeleton via tiny valves called [[spiracle]]s. Insects also lack closed blood vessels; instead, they have a long, thin, perforated tube along the top of the body (called the "dorsal aorta") that functions like a heart, and pumps [[haemolymph]] toward the head, thus driving the circulation of the internal fluids. The [[nervous system]] consists of a [[ventral nerve cord]] that runs the length of the body, with several [[ganglia]] and branches along the way reaching into the extremities of the appendages.<ref name="insectmorph">Borror, Triplehorn & Delong (1989), pp. 24<U+2013>71</ref>

===Head===
An ant's head contains many sensory organs. Like most insects, ants have [[compound eye]]s made from numerous tiny lenses attached together. Ant eyes are good for acute movement detection, but do not offer a high [[Optical resolution|resolution]] image. They also have three small [[ocellus|ocelli]] (simple eyes) on the top of the head that detect light levels and [[polarization (waves)|polarization]].<ref>{{cite journal

Two [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] ("feelers") are attached to the head; these organs detect chemicals, air currents, and vibrations; they also are used to transmit and receive signals through touch. The head has two strong jaws, the [[Mandible (insect)|mandibles]], used to carry food, manipulate objects, construct nests, and for defence.<ref name="insectmorph"/> In some species a small pocket (infrabuccal chamber) inside the mouth stores food, so it may be passed to other ants or their larvae.<ref>{{cite journal

===Legs===
All six [[arthropod leg|legs]] are attached to the [[mesosoma]] ("thorax") and terminate in a hooked [[Chelae|claw]].

===Wings===
Only reproductive ants, [[Queen (insect)|queens]] and males, have [[insect wing|wings]]. Queens shed the wings after the [[nuptial flight]], leaving visible stubs, a distinguishing feature of queens. Wingless queens ([[ergatoid]]s) and males occur in a few species, however.<ref name="insectmorph"/>

===Metasoma===
The [[metasoma]] (the "abdomen") of the ant houses important internal organs, including those of the reproductive, respiratory (tracheae), and excretory systems. Workers of many species have their [[ovipositor|egg-laying structures]] modified into [[stinger (organ)|stings]] that are used for subduing [[predation|prey]] and defending their nests.<ref name="insectmorph"/>

===Polymorphism===
[[Image:Atta.cephalotes.gamut.selection.jpg|thumb|right|Seven [[Leafcutter ant]] workers of various castes (left) and two Queens (right)]]
In the colonies of a few ant species, there are physical castes<U+2014>workers in distinct size-classes, called minor, median, and major workers. Often, the larger ants have disproportionately larger heads, and correspondingly stronger [[mandible (insect)|mandibles]]. Such individuals are sometimes called "soldier" ants because their stronger mandibles make them more effective in fighting, although they still are workers and their "duties" typically do not vary greatly from the minor or median workers. In a few species, the median workers are absent, creating a sharp divide between the minors and majors.<ref>{{cite journal |author=[[E. O.

==Development and reproduction==
[[Image:Meat eater ant nest swarming02.jpg|thumb|Meat eater ant nest during swarming]]
The life of an ant starts from an [[egg (biology)|egg]]. If the egg is fertilised, the progeny will be female ([[diploid]]); if not, it will be male ([[haploid]]). Ants develop by [[complete metamorphosis]] with the [[larva]] stages passing through a [[pupa]]l stage before emerging as an adult. The larva is largely immobile and is fed and cared for by workers. Food is given to the larvae by [[trophallaxis]], a process in which an ant [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitates]] liquid food held in its [[Crop (anatomy)|crop]]. This is also how adults share food, stored in the "social stomach". Larvae, especially in the later stages, may also be provided solid food such as [[trophic egg]]s, pieces of prey, and seeds brought by workers.

The larvae grow through a series of four or five [[moult]]s and enter the pupal stage. The pupa has the appendages free and not fused to the body as in a [[Chrysalis|butterfly pupa]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Gillott, Cedric|year=1995|title=Entomology|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-306-44967-6|page=325}}</ref> The differentiation into queens and workers (which are both female), and different [[caste (biology)|caste]]s of workers (when they exist), is influenced in some species by the nutrition the larvae obtain. Genetic influences and the [[polyphenism|control of gene expression]] by the developmental environment are complex and the determination of caste continues to be a subject of research.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The causes and consequences of genetic caste determination in ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)|first1=Kirk E.|last1=Anderson|first2=Timothy A. |last2=Linksvayer|first3=Chris R. |last3=Smith|journal=Myrmecol.

A new worker spends the first few days of its adult life caring for the queen and young. She then graduates to digging and other nest work, and later to defending the nest and foraging. These changes are sometimes fairly sudden, and define what are called temporal castes. An explanation for the sequence is suggested by the high casualties involved in foraging, making it an acceptable risk only for ants who are older and are likely to die soon of natural causes.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|year=1989|volume=34|pages=191<U+2013>210|title=Foraging strategies of ants|author=Traniello JFA|doi=10.1146/annurev.en.34.010189.001203}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Sorensen A, Busch TM, Vinson SB|title=Behavioral flexibility of temporal sub-castes in the fire ant, ''Solenopsis invicta'', in response to food|journal=Psyche|volume=91|pages=319<U+2013>332|year=1984|url=http://psyche.entclub.org/91/91-319.html|doi=10.1155/1984/39236|issue=3<U+2013>4}}</ref>

Most ant species have a system in which only the queen and breeding females have the ability to mate. Contrary to popular belief, some ant nests have multiple queens, while others may exist without queens. Workers with the ability to reproduce are called "[[gamergate]]s" and colonies that lack queens are then called gamergate colonies; colonies with queens are said to be queen-right.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Peeters C, Holldobler B|year=1995|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=92|pages=10977<U+2013>10979|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/92/24/10977.pdf|format=PDF|title=Reproductive cooperation between queens and their mated workers: the complex life history of an ant with a valuable nest|doi=10.1073/pnas.92.24.10977|pmid=11607589|issue=24|pmc=40553|bibcode = 1995PNAS...9210977P }}</ref> The winged male ants, called drones, emerge from pupae along with the breeding females (although some species, such as [[army ant]]s, have wingless queens), and do nothing in life except eat and mate.

Typically, the males take flight before the females. Males then use visual cues to find a common mating ground, for example, a landmark such as a pine tree to which other males in the area converge. Males secrete a mating pheromone that females follow. Females of some species mate with just one male, but in others they may mate with as many as ten or more different males.<ref name=TheAntsRelations>H<U+00F6>lldobler & Wilson (1990)</ref>

Mated females then seek a suitable place to begin a colony. There, they break off their wings and begin to lay and care for eggs.
The females store the [[Spermatozoon|sperm]] they obtain during their nuptial flight to selectively fertilise future eggs.
The first workers to hatch are weak and smaller than later workers, but they begin to serve the colony immediately. They enlarge the nest, forage for food, and care for the other eggs. This is how new colonies start in most ant species. Species that have multiple queens may have a queen leaving the nest along with some workers to found a colony at a new site,<ref name = HolldoblerWilsonAnts2>H<U+00F6>lldobler & Wilson (1990), pp. 143<U+2013>179</ref> a process akin to [[Swarming (honey bee)|swarming]] in [[honeybee]]s.

[[Image:FlyingAnts.jpg|thumb|Ants mating]]
A wide range of reproductive strategies have been noted in ant species. Females of many species are known to be capable of reproducing asexually through [[thelytoky|thelytokous parthenogenesis]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heinze|first=Jurgen|year=1995|title=Ant reproductive strategies|journal=Res.

Ant colonies can be long-lived. The queens can live for up to 30&nbsp;years, and workers live from 1 to 3&nbsp;years. Males, however, are more transitory, being quite short-lived and surviving for only a few weeks.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Keller L|year=1998 |title=Queen lifespan and colony characteristics in ants and termites |journal=[[Insectes Sociaux]] |volume=45 |pages=235<U+2013>246 |doi=10.1007/s000400050084 |issue=3}}</ref> Ant queens are estimated to live 100 times longer than solitary insects of a similar size.<ref name=insencyc>{{cite book|author=Franks NR, Resh VH, Card<U+00E9> RT (eds)|year=2003|title=Encyclopedia of Insects|pages=29<U+2013>32|isbn=0-12-586990-8|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego}}</ref>

Ants are active all year long in the tropics, but, in cooler regions, they survive the winter in a state of dormancy or inactivity. The forms of inactivity are varied and some temperate species have larvae going into the inactive state, ([[diapause]]), while in others, the adults alone pass the winter in a state of reduced activity.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kipyatkov VE|year=2001|title=Seasonal life cycles and the forms of dormancy in ants (Hymenoptera, Formicoidea)|journal=Acta Societatis Zoologicae Bohemicae|volume=65|issue=2|pages=198<U+2013>217}}</ref>

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Communication===
[[File:Camponotus_sericeus_Senegal.jpg|thumb|Two ''[[Camponotus sericeus]]'' workers communicating through touch and pheromones]]
Ants communicate with each other using [[pheromone]]s, sounds, and touch.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jackson DE, Ratnieks FL |title=Communication in ants |journal=Curr. Biol. |volume=16 |issue=15 |pages=R570<U+2013>R574 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16890508 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.07.015 |url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/retrieve/pii/S0960982206018343}}</ref> The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the [[red harvester ant]], than in other [[hymenopteran]] groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Goss|first1=S.|last2=Aron|first2=S.|last3=Deneubourg |first3=J.L.|last4=Pasteels |first4=J.M.|year=1989|title=Self-organized shortcuts in the Argentine ant|journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=76 |pages=579<U+2013>581 |doi=10.1007/BF00462870 |issue=12|url=http://www.ulb.ac.be/sciences/use/publications/JLD/56.pdf|bibcode = 1989NW.....76..579G }}</ref>

Ants use pheromones for more than just making trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away.

Ants attack and defend themselves by biting and, in many species, by stinging, often injecting or spraying chemicals, such as [[formic acid]] in the case of [[formicine]] ants, [[alkaloids]] and [[piperidines]] in [[fire ants]], and a variety of protein components in other ants.

The ants were also observed to use their jaws as a [[catapult]] to eject intruders or fling themselves backward to escape a threat.<ref name="TrapJawPatek" /> Before striking, the ant opens its mandibles extremely widely and locks them in this position by an internal mechanism. Energy is stored in a thick band of [[muscle]] and explosively released when triggered by the stimulation of [[sensory receptor|sensory]] organs resembling hairs on the inside of the mandibles. The mandibles also permit slow and fine movements for other tasks.

A Malaysian species of ant in the ''[[Camponotus]]'' ''cylindricus'' [[superspecies|group]] has enlarged mandibular glands that extend into their gaster. When disturbed, workers rupture the membrane of the gaster, causing a burst of secretions containing [[acetophenone]]s and other chemicals that immobilise small insect attackers. The worker subsequently dies.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Jones, T.H.; Clark, D.A.; Edwards, A.A.; Davidson, D.W.; Spande, T.F. & Snelling, Roy R.|year=2004|title=The Chemistry of Exploding Ants, ''Camponotus'' spp. (''Cylindricus'' complex)|journal= Journal of Chemical Ecology |volume=30|issue=8|pages=1479<U+2013>1492|doi=10.1023/B:JOEC.0000042063.01424.28|pmid=15537154}}</ref>

===Learning===
Many animals can learn behaviours by imitation, but ants may be the only group apart from [[mammal]]s where interactive teaching has been observed. A knowledgeable forager of ''[[Temnothorax albipennis]]'' will lead a naive nest-mate to newly discovered food by the process of [[tandem running]]. The follower obtains knowledge through its leading tutor. The leader is acutely sensitive to the progress of the follower and slows down when the follower lags and speeds up when the follower gets too close.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Franks NR, Richardson T| year=2006 |title=Teaching in tandem-running ants|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=439 |issue=7073 |page=153|pmid=16407943 |doi=10.1038/439153a|bibcode = 2006Natur.439..153F }}</ref>

Controlled experiments with colonies of ''[[Cerapachys biroi]]'' suggest that an individual may choose nest roles based on her previous experience. An entire generation of identical workers was divided into two groups whose outcome in food foraging was controlled. One group was continually rewarded with prey, while it was made certain that the other failed. As a result, members of the successful group intensified their foraging attempts while the unsuccessful group ventured out fewer and fewer times. A month later, the successful foragers continued in their role while the others had moved to specialise in brood care.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ravary F, Lecoutey E, Kaminski G, Ch<U+00E2>line N, Jaisson P| year=2007 |title=Individual experience alone can generate lasting division of labor in ants|journal=[[Current Biology]] |volume=17 |issue=15 |pages=1308<U+2013>1312 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.06.047 |pmid=17629482}}</ref>

===Nest construction===
{{Main|Ant colony}}
[[Image:WeaverAntNest.JPG|thumb|Leaf nest of [[weaver ants]], [[Pamalican]], [[Philippines]]]]
Complex nests are built by many ant species, but other species are nomadic and do not build permanent structures. Ants may form subterranean nests or build them on trees. These nests may be found in the ground, under stones or logs, inside logs, hollow stems, or even acorns. The materials used for construction include soil and plant matter,<ref name = HolldoblerWilsonAnts2/> and ants carefully select their nest sites; ''Temnothorax albipennis'' will avoid sites with dead ants, as these may indicate the presence of pests or disease. They are quick to abandon established nests at the first sign of threats.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Franks NR, Hooper J, Webb C, Dornhaus A|year= 2005|title=Tomb evaders: house-hunting hygiene in ants|journal=[[Biology Letters]]|volume=1|issue=2|pages=190<U+2013>192|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0302|pmid=17148163|pmc=1626204}}</ref>

The [[army ant]]s of South America, such as the ''[[Eciton burchellii]]'' species, and the [[driver ant]]s of Africa do not build permanent nests, but instead, alternate between nomadism and stages where the workers form a temporary nest ([[bivouac (ants)|bivouac]]) from their own bodies, by holding each other together.<ref>H<U+00F6>lldobler & Wilson (1990), p. 573</ref>

[[Weaver ant]] (''Oecophylla'' spp.) workers build nests in trees by attaching leaves together, first pulling them together with bridges of workers and then inducing their larvae to produce silk as they are moved along the leaf edges. Similar forms of nest construction are seen in some species of ''[[Polyrhachis]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Robson SK, Kohout RJ|year=2005|title=Evolution of nest-weaving behaviour in arboreal nesting ants of the genus ''Polyrhachis'' Fr.

''[[Formica polyctena]]'', among other ant species, constructs nests that maintain a relatively constant interior temperature that aids in the development of larvae. The ants maintain the nest temperature by choosing the location, nest materials, controlling ventilation and maintaining the heat from solar radiation, worker activity and metabolism, and in some moist nests, microbial activity in the nest materials.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Frouz|first=J.|title=The Effect of Nest Moisture on Daily Temperature Regime in the Nests of ''Formica polyctena'' Wood Ants.|journal=Insectes Sociaux| volume=47 |year=2000|pages=229<U+2013>235|doi=10.1007/PL00001708}}</ref>

Some ant species, such as those that use natural cavities, can be opportunistic and make use of the controlled micro-climate provided inside human dwellings and other artificial structures to house their colonies and nest structures.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal= Biological Conservation| volume= 115 |issue= 2| year=2004| pages= 279<U+2013>289| title= Impact of human dwellings on the distribution of the exotic Argentine ant: a case study in the Do<U+00F1>ana National Park, Spain|first1= Soledad |last1=Carpintero| first2= Joaqu<U+0131><U+0301>n |last2=Reyes-L<U+00F3>pez| first3= Luis Arias|last3= de Reynac|doi=10.1016/S0006-3207(03)00147-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.eeescience.utoledo.edu/Faculty/Philpott/Publications_files/Friedrich_2009%20Nest%20Site%20Limitation.pdf |title = Nest-site Limitation and Nesting Resources of Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in Urban Green Spaces |first1=Russell| last1=Friedrich| first2=Stacy M. |last2=Philpott| journal= Environmental Entomology| volume=38| issue=3| pages=600<U+2013>607| year=2009 | doi=10.1603/022.038.0311}}</ref>

Most ants are generalist predators, scavengers, and indirect herbivores,<ref name=riseofants/> but a few have evolved specialised ways of obtaining nutrition.

They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens. Workers specialise in related tasks according to their sizes. The largest ants cut stalks, smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus. Leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called ''[[gongylidia]]''. [[Symbiosis|Symbiotic]] bacteria on the exterior surface of the ants produce antibiotics that kill bacteria introduced into the nest that may harm the fungi.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Nature|year=1999|volume=398|title=Ants, plants and antibiotics|author=Schultz TR|pages=747<U+2013>748 | doi = 10.1038/19619|issue=6730 |url=http://www.insecta.ufv.br/Entomologia/ent/disciplina/ban%20160/AULAP/aula2/AntsandBacteria.pdf|bibcode = 1999Natur.398..747S }}</ref>

===Locomotion===
The female worker ants do not have wings and reproductive females lose their wings after their mating flights in order to begin their colonies. Therefore, unlike their wasp ancestors, most ants travel by walking. Some species are capable of leaping.

Other species of ants can form chains to bridge gaps over water, underground, or through spaces in vegetation. Some species also form floating rafts that help them survive floods.

===Cooperation and competition===
[[File:Ants eating cicada, jjron 22.11.2009.jpg|thumb|right|[[Meat ant|Meat-eater ants]] feeding on a [[cicada]], social ants cooperate and collectively gather food]]
Not all ants have the same kind of societies. The Australian [[bulldog ant]]s are among the biggest and most [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] of ants. Like virtually all ants, they are [[Eusociality|eusocial]], but their social behaviour is poorly developed compared to other species. Each individual hunts alone, using her large eyes instead of chemical senses to find prey.<ref name=Crosland1988>{{cite journal

Some species (such as ''[[Tetramorium caespitum]]'') attack and take over neighbouring ant colonies. Others are less expansionist, but just as aggressive; they invade colonies to steal eggs or larvae, which they either eat or raise as workers or slaves.

Ants identify kin and nestmates through their scent, which comes from [[hydrocarbon]]-laced secretions that coat their exoskeletons. If an ant is separated from its original colony, it will eventually lose the colony scent. Any ant that enters a colony without a matching scent will be attacked.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Henderson G, Andersen JF, Phillips JK, Jeanne RL|year=2005 |title=Internest aggression and identification of possible nestmate discrimination pheromones in polygynous ant ''Formica montana'' |journal=[[Journal of Chemical Ecology]] |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=2217<U+2013>2228 |doi=10.1007/BF01026932}}</ref> Also, the reason why two separate colonies of ants will attack each other even if they are of the same species is because the genes responsible for pheromone production are different between them. The [[Argentine ant]], however, does not have this characteristic, due to lack of genetic diversity, and has become a global pest because of it.

Parasitic ant species enter the colonies of host ants and establish themselves as social parasites; species such as ''[[Strumigenys xenos]]'' are entirely parasitic and do not have workers, but instead, rely on the food gathered by their ''Strumigenys perplexa'' hosts.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ward PS|year=1996|title=A new workerless social parasite in the ant genus ''Pseudomyrmex'' (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), with a discussion of the origin of social parasitism in ants|journal=[[Systematic Entomology]]|volume= 21|pages=253<U+2013>263|url=http://www.archive.org/details/ants_08424|doi=10.1046/j.1365-3113.1996.d01-12.x|issue=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Taylor RW|year=1968|title=The Australian workerless inquiline ant, ''Strumigenys xenos'' Brown (Hymenoptera-Formicidae) recorded from New Zealand|journal= New Zealand Entomologist|volume=4|issue=1|pages=47<U+2013>49|url=http://www.archive.org/details/ants_10687|doi=10.1080/00779962.1968.9722888}}</ref> This form of parasitism is seen across many ant genera, but the parasitic ant is usually a species that is closely related to its host. A variety of methods are employed to enter the nest of the host ant. A parasitic queen may enter the host nest before the first brood has hatched, establishing herself prior to development of a colony scent. Other species use pheromones to confuse the host ants or to trick them into carrying the parasitic queen into the nest. Some simply fight their way into the nest.<ref name=TheAntParasites>H<U+00F6>lldobler & Wilson (1990), pp. 436<U+2014>448</ref>

A [[sexual conflict|conflict between the sexes]] of a species is seen in some species of ants with these reproducers apparently competing to produce offspring that are as closely related to them as possible. The most extreme form involves the production of clonal offspring. An extreme of sexual conflict is seen in ''[[Wasmannia auropunctata]]'', where the queens produce diploid daughters by thelytokous parthenogenesis and males produce clones by a process whereby a diploid egg loses its maternal contribution to produce haploid males who are clones of the father.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Clonal reproduction by males and females in the little fire ant|author=Fournier, D, Estoup A, Orivel J, Foucaud J, Jourdan H, Le Breton J, Keller L|year=2005|journal=Nature|volume=435|doi=10.1038/nature03705|pages=1230<U+2013>1234|pmid=15988525|issue=7046|bibcode = 2005Natur.435.1230F }}</ref>

===Relationships with other organisms===
[[File:Myrmarachne plataleoides female thailand.jpg|thumb|The spider ''[[Myrmarachne plataleoides]]'' (female shown) mimics [[weaver ant]]s to avoid predators.]]
Ants form [[symbiotic]] associations with a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These [[inquiline]]s may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this [[ant mimicry]] (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving [[Batesian mimicry]], where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show [[Wasmannian mimicry]], a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Ant-mimicry in Panamanian clubionid and salticid spiders (Araneae: Clubionidae, Salticidae)|author=Reiskind J|journal=Biotropica|volume=9|issue=1|year=1977|pages=1<U+2013>8|doi=10.2307/2387854|jstor=2387854}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Myrmecomorphy and myrmecophily in spiders: A Review|author=Cushing PE|journal=The Florida Entomologist|volume=80|issue=2|year=1997|pages=165<U+2013>193|doi=10.2307/3495552|url=http://www.fcla.edu/FlaEnt/fe80p165.pdf|format=PDF|jstor=3495552}}</ref>


[[Image:Ant Receives Honeydew from Aphid.jpg|thumb|left|An ant collects [[honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]] from an [[aphid]]]]
[[Aphid]]s and other [[hemiptera]]n insects secrete a sweet liquid called [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]], when they feed on [[plant sap]]. The sugars in honeydew are a high-energy food source, which many ant species collect.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Styrsky JD, Eubanks MD |title=Ecological consequences of interactions between ants and honeydew-producing insects |journal=Proc.

The ants in turn keep predators away from the aphids and will move them from one feeding location to another. When migrating to a new area, many colonies will take the aphids with them, to ensure a continued supply of honeydew. Ants also tend [[mealybug]]s to harvest their honeydew. Mealybugs may become a serious pest of pineapples if ants are present to protect mealybugs from their natural enemies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jahn GC, Beardsley JW |year=1996 |title=Effects of ''Pheidole megacephala'' (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) on survival and dispersal of ''Dysmicoccus neobrevipes'' (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae) |journal=[[Journal of Economic Entomology]] |volume=89 |pages=1124<U+2013>1129}}</ref>

[[Myrmecophile|Myrmecophilous]] (ant-loving) [[caterpillar]]s of the butterfly family [[Lycaenidae]] (e.g., blues, coppers, or hairstreaks) are herded by the ants, led to feeding areas in the daytime, and brought inside the ants' nest at night.

[[Anteater]]s, [[aardvark]]s, [[pangolin]]s, [[echidna]]s and [[numbat]]s have special [[adaptation]]s for living on a diet of ants. These adaptations include long, sticky tongues to capture ants and strong claws to break into ant nests. [[Brown bear]]s (''Ursus arctos'') have been found to feed on ants.

==Relationship with humans==
[[Image:AntsStitchingLeave.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Weaver ant]]s are used as a [[biological control]] for citrus cultivation in southern China]]
Ants perform many ecological roles that are beneficial to humans, including the suppression of [[Pest (organism)|pest]] populations and aeration of the [[soil]]. The use of [[weaver ant]]s in citrus cultivation in southern China is considered one of the oldest known applications of [[biological control]].<ref name = HolldoblerWilsonAnts3>H<U+00F6>lldobler & Wilson (1990), pp. 619<U+2013>629</ref> On the other hand, ants may become nuisances when they invade buildings, or cause economic losses.

In some parts of the world (mainly Africa and South America), large ants, especially [[army ant]]s, are used as [[surgical suture]]s. The wound is pressed together and ants are applied along it. The ant seizes the edges of the wound in its mandibles and locks in place. The body is then cut off and the head and mandibles remain in place to close the wound.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gottrup F, Leaper D|year=2004 |title=Wound healing: Historical aspects |journal=[[EWMA Journal]] |volume=4 |issue=2 |url=http://www.ewma.org/pdf/fall04/Historical_Aspects.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070616090223/http://www.ewma.org/pdf/fall04/Historical_Aspects.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-16|format=PDF|page=5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Gudger EW|year=1925|title=Stitching wounds with the mandibles of ants and beetles|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=84|pages=1861<U+2013>1864|doi=10.1001/jama.1925.02660500069048|issue=24}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Robert M.|last=Sapolsky|year=2001|title=A Primate's Memoir: A Neuroscientist's Unconventional Life Among the Baboons|page=156|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=0-7432-0241-4}}</ref>

In [[South Africa]], ants are used to help harvest [[rooibos]] (''Aspalathus linearis''), which are small seeds used to make a herbal tea. The plant disperses its seeds widely, making manual collection difficult. Black ants collect and store these and other seeds in their nest, where humans can gather them ''en masse''. Up to half a pound (200&nbsp;g) of seeds may be collected from one ant-heap.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ciel.org/Publications/InnovativeMechanisms.pdf|format=PDF|title=Innovative mechanisms for sharing benefits of biodiversity and related knowledge|author=Downes D, Laird SA|year=1999|publisher=The Center for International Environmental Law|accessdate=8 June 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080423211123/http://www.ciel.org/Publications/InnovativeMechanisms.pdf| archivedate= 23 April 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Economic Botany|title=Rooibos tea, a South African contribution to world beverages|volume=17|issue=3|pages=186<U+2013>194|year=1963|author=Cheney RH, Scholtz E|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/321875k510720085/|doi=10.1007/BF02859435}}</ref>

Although most ants survive attempts by humans to eradicate them, a few are highly endangered. These tend to be island species that have evolved specialized traits and risk being displaced by introduced ant species. Examples include the critically endangered [[Sri Lankan relict ant]] (''Aneuretus simoni'') and ''[[Adetomyrma venatrix]]'' of Madagascar.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The influence of sociality on the conservation biology of social insects|author=Chapman, RE; Bourke, Andrew FG|journal= Ecology Letters|volume=4|issue=6|year=2001|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/120712743/PDFSTART|format=PDF|pages=650<U+2013>662|doi=10.1046/j.1461-0248.2001.00253.x}}</ref>

It has been estimated by [[E.O. Wilson]] that the total number of individual ants alive in the world at any one time is between one and ten [[1,000,000,000,000,000|quadrillion]] ([[short scale]]) (i.e. between 10<sup>15</sup> and 10<sup>16</sup>).

Ants and their larvae are eaten in different parts of the world. The eggs of two species of ants are used in Mexican ''[[escamoles]]''. They are considered a form of insect [[caviar]] and can sell for as much as US$40 per pound ($90/kg) because they are seasonal and hard to find. In the [[Colombia]]n department of [[Santander Department|Santander]], ''hormigas culonas'' (roughly interpreted as "large-bottomed ants") ''[[Atta laevigata]]'' are toasted alive and eaten.<ref>{{cite journal|author=DeFoliart GR|title=Insects as food: Why the western attitude is important|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|volume=44|pages=21<U+2013>50|year=1999|doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.44.1.21|pmid=9990715}}</ref>
<!-- In many [[movie theater]]s in Colombia, these ants are served as an alternative to [[popcorn]]. -->

In areas of [[India]], and throughout [[Burma]] and [[Thailand]], a paste of the green weaver ant (''[[Oecophylla smaragdina]]'') is served as a condiment with curry.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bingham CT|year=1903|title=Fauna of British India.

[[William Saville-Kent|Saville-Kent]], in the ''Naturalist in Australia'' wrote "Beauty, in the case of the green ant, is more than skin-deep. Their attractive, almost sweetmeat-like translucency possibly invited the first essays at their consumption by the human species". Mashed up in water, after the manner of lemon squash, "these ants form a pleasant acid drink which is held in high favor by the natives of North Queensland, and is even appreciated by many European palates".<ref name="beq">{{cite journal |author=Bequaert J|year=1921 |title=Insects as food: How they have augmented the food supply of mankind in early and recent times|journal=Natural History Journal|volume=21|pages=191<U+2013>200}}</ref>

In his ''First Summer in the Sierra'', [[John Muir]] notes that the [[Paiute|Digger Indians]] of [[California]] ate the tickling, acid gasters of the large jet-black [[carpenter ant]]s.

[[File:Monomorium pharaonis.jpg|thumb|The tiny [[pharaoh ant]] is a major pest in hospitals and office blocks; it can make nests between sheets of paper]]

Some ant species are considered as pests. The presence of ants can be undesirable in places meant to be sterile. They can also come in the way of humans by their habit of raiding stored food, damaging indoor structures, causing damage to agricultural crops either directly or by aiding sucking pests or because of their stings and bites.<ref name="pests">{{cite web|url=http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7411.html|title=Pest Notes: Ants (Publication 7411)|publisher=University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources|year=2007|accessdate=5 June 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080705125812/http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7411.html| archivedate= 5 July 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The adaptive nature of ant colonies make it nearly impossible to eliminate entire colonies and most pest management practices aim to control local populations and tend to be temporary solutions.

Some of the ants classified as pests include the [[pavement ant]], [[yellow crazy ant]], [[sugar ant]]s, the [[Pharaoh ant]], [[carpenter ants]], [[Argentine ant]], [[Tapinoma sessile|odorous house ants]], [[red imported fire ant]], and [[Myrmica rubra|European fire ant]]. Ant populations are managed by a combination of approaches that make use of chemical, biological and physical methods. Chemical methods include the use of insecticidal bait which is gathered by ants as food and brought back to the nest where the poison is inadvertently spread to other colony members through [[trophallaxis]]. Management is based on the species and techniques can vary according to the location and circumstance.<ref name="pests" />

Observed by humans since the dawn of history, the behaviour of ants has been documented and the subject of early writings and fables passed from one century to another. Those using scientific methods, [[Myrmecology|myrmecologists]], study ants in the laboratory and in their natural conditions. Their complex and variable social structures have made ants ideal [[model organism]]s. [[Ultraviolet vision]] was first discovered in ants by [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|Sir John Lubbock]] in 1881.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lubbock|first=J.|year=1881|title=Observations on ants, bees, and wasps.

The successful techniques used by ant colonies have been studied in computer science and robotics to produce distributed and fault-tolerant systems for solving problems, for example [[Ant colony optimization]] and [[Ant robotics]].

[[Anthropomorphism|Anthropomorphised]] ants have often been used in fables and children's stories to represent industriousness and cooperative effort. They also are mentioned in religious texts.<ref>{{cite book |title=Quran |chapter=27:18<U+2013>19 |url=http://www.wright-house.com/religions/islam/Quran/27-ant.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Sahih Bukhari|chapter=Vol 4, Book 54, Number 536 |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/054.sbt.html}}</ref> In the [[Book of Proverbs]] in the [[Bible]], ants are held up as a good example for humans for their hard work and cooperation.

Ant society has always fascinated humans and has been written about both humorously and seriously. [[Mark Twain]] wrote about ants in his 1880 book ''[[A Tramp Abroad]]''.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=22 The Black Forest and Its Treasures|title=A Tramp Abroad|last=Twain|first=Mark|year=1880|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/119/|isbn=0-19-510137-5|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}</ref> Some modern authors have used the example of the ants to comment on the relationship between society and the individual. Examples are [[Robert Frost]] in his poem "Departmental" and [[T. H. White]] in his fantasy novel ''[[The Once and Future King]]''. The plot in French entomologist and writer [[Bernard Werber]]'s ''[[Les Fourmis]]'' science-fiction trilogy is divided between the worlds of ants and humans; ants and their behaviour is described using contemporary scientific knowledge. [[H.G. Wells]] wrote about intelligent ants destroying human settlements in Brazil and threatening human civilization in his 1905 science-fiction short story, ''[[Empire of the Ants|The Empire of the Ants]].'' In more recent times, animated cartoons and 3-D animated films featuring ants have been produced including ''[[Antz]]'', ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', ''[[The Ant Bully (film)|The Ant Bully]]'', ''[[The Ant and the Aardvark]]'', and ''[[Atom Ant]].'' Renowned [[Myrmecology|myrmecologist]] [[E. O. Wilson]] wrote a short story, "Trailhead" in 2010 for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine, which describes the life and death of an ant-queen and the rise and fall of her colony, from an ants' point of view.<ref name="Trailhead">{{cite web|author=Wilson, EO|url=http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2010/01/25/100125fi_fiction_wilson?currentPage=all |title=Trailhead|publisher=The New Yorker|date=25 January 2010|pages=56<U+2013>62}}</ref>

From the late 1950s through the late 1970s, [[formicarium|ant farms]] were popular educational children's toys in the United States. Later versions use transparent gel instead of soil, allowing greater visibility.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Guri, Assaf|title=Habitat media for ants and other invertebrates (US Patent 5803014)|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office|date=8 September 1998}}</ref> In the early 1990s, the video game [[SimAnt]], which simulated an ant colony, won the 1992 [[Codie awards|Codie award]] for "Best Simulation Program".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.siia.net/codies/2009/pw_1992.asp |title= 1992 Excellence in Software Awards Winners |accessdate=3 April 2008|publisher=Software & Information Industry Association}}</ref>

Ants also are quite popular inspiration for many [[science-fiction]] [[insectoid]]s, such as the Formics of ''[[Ender's Game]]'', the Bugs of ''[[Starship Troopers]]'', the giant ants in the films ''[[Them!]]'' and ''[[Empire of the Ants (film)|Empire of the Ants]],'' [[Marvel Comics]]' super hero [[Ant-Man]], and ants mutated into super-intelligence in ''[[Phase IV]]''. In computer [[strategy games]], ant-based species often benefit from increased production rates due to their single-minded focus, such as the Klackons in the ''[[Master of Orion]]'' series of games or the ChCht in ''[[Deadlock II]]''. These characters are often credited with a [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]], a common misconception about ant colonies.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Robots, insects and swarm intelligence|journal=Artificial Intelligence Review|volume=26|issue=4|year=2006|author=Sharkey AJC|doi=10.1007/s10462-007-9057-y|pages=255<U+2013>268}}</ref>
