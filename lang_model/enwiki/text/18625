The '''SS ''Edmund Fitzgerald''''' was an American [[lake freighter|Great Lakes freighter]] that made headlines after sinking in a [[Lake Superior]] storm on November&nbsp;10, 1975, with the loss of the entire crew of 29. When launched on June&nbsp;8, 1958, she was the largest boat on [[North America]]'s [[Great Lakes]], and she remains the largest boat to have sunk there. Nicknamed the "Mighty Fitz", "Fitz", or "Big Fitz", the ship suffered a series of mishaps during her launch: it took three attempts to break the champagne bottle used to christen her, and she collided with a pier when she entered the water.

For seventeen&nbsp;years the ''Fitzgerald'' carried [[taconite]] [[iron|iron ore]] from mines near [[Duluth, Minnesota]], to iron works in [[Detroit]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], and other Great Lakes ports. As a "workhorse" she set seasonal haul records six different times, often beating her own previous record.{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=164}}{{sfn|Kantar|1998|p=9}} Her size, record-breaking performance, and "[[Disc jockey|DJ]] captain" endeared the ''Fitzgerald'' to boat watchers. Captain Peter Pulcer was known for piping music day or night over the ship's intercom system while passing through the [[St. Clair River|St. Clair]] and [[Detroit River|Detroit]] Rivers (between Lakes [[Lake Huron|Huron]] and [[Lake Erie|Erie]]), and entertaining spectators at the [[Soo Locks]] (between Lakes [[Lake Superior|Superior]] and [[Lake Huron|Huron]]) with a running commentary about the ''Fitzgerald''.{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=164}}

Carrying a full cargo of [[taconite]] ore pellets with Captain [[Ernest M. McSorley]] in command, the ''Edmund Fitzgerald'' embarked on her final voyage from [[Superior, Wisconsin]] (near Duluth), on the afternoon of November&nbsp;9, 1975. En route to a steel mill near [[Detroit, Michigan]], she joined a second freighter, the [[SS Arthur M. Anderson|SS ''Arthur M. Anderson'']]. By the next day the two ships were caught in the midst of a massive winter storm on Lake Superior, with near [[Saffir<U+2013>Simpson Hurricane Scale|hurricane-force]] winds and waves up to {{convert|35|ft}} high. Shortly after 7:10&nbsp;p.m. the ''Fitzgerald'' suddenly sank in Canadian waters {{convert|530|ft}} deep, approximately {{convert|17|mi|nmi km|abbr=off|sp=us}} from the entrance to [[Whitefish Bay]] near the twin cities of  [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan]] and [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario]]. Although the ''Fitzgerald'' had reported being in difficulty earlier, no distress signals were sent before she sank. Her crew of 29 all perished, and no bodies were recovered.

Many theories, books, studies and expeditions have examined the cause of the sinking. The ''Fitzgerald'' may have fallen victim to the high waves of the storm, suffered structural failure, been swamped with water entering through her cargo hatches or deck, experienced topside damage, or [[shoal]]ed in a shallow part of Lake Superior. The sinking of the ''Edmund Fitzgerald'' is one of the best-known disasters in the history of Great Lakes shipping. [[Gordon Lightfoot]] made it the subject of his 1976&nbsp;hit song "[[The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald|The Wreck of the ''Edmund Fitzgerald'']]".

Investigations into the sinking led to changes in Great Lakes shipping regulations and practices that included mandatory survival suits, depth finders, positioning systems, increased [[Freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]], and more frequent inspection of vessels.

==History==
[[Image:Fitz Upbound & In Ballast - Coast Guard.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=SS Edmund Fitzgerald upbound and in ballast |SS ''Edmund Fitzgerald'' [[upbound]] and in [[Sailing ballast|ballast]]]]
===Design and construction===
[[Northwestern Mutual Financial Network|Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company]] of [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin, invested in the iron and minerals industries on a large-scale basis, including the construction of the ''Fitzgerald'', which represented the first such investment by any American life insurance company.{{sfn|Schumacher|2005|p=14}} In 1957, they contracted [[Great Lakes Engineering Works]] (GLEW), of [[River Rouge, Michigan]], to design and construct the ship "within a foot of the maximum length allowed for passage through the soon-to-be completed Saint Lawrence Seaway."{{sfn|MacInnis|1998|p=20}} The ''Fitzgerald'' was the first [[Lake freighter|laker]] built to the [[seawaymax|maximum St. Lawrence Seaway size]],{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=165}} which was {{convert|730|ft|m|1}} long, {{convert|75|ft|m|1}} wide, and {{convert|25|ft|m|1}} deep.{{sfn|Jenish|2009|p=31}} The [[Moulded depth|moulded]] depth (roughly speaking, the vertical height of the body of the ship) was {{convert|39|ft|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Devendorf|1996|p=151}} The hold depth (the inside height of the cargo hold) was {{convert|33|ft|4|in|m|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Devendorf|1996|p=151}}{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=164}} GLEW laid the first [[keel]] plate on August 7 the same year.{{sfn|MacInnis|1998|p=21}}

With a [[deadweight tonnage|deadweight capacity]] of {{convert|26000|LT|ST t|0|lk=in}},{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=164}} and a {{convert|729|ft}} hull, the ''Fitzgerald'' was the longest ship on the Great Lakes, earning her the title [[Queen of the Lakes]]{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=165}} until September 17, 1959, when the {{convert|730|ft|adj=on|sigfig=4}} SS ''Murray Bay'' was launched.{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=170}} The ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s three central cargo holds{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|p=226}} were loaded through 21 watertight hatches, each {{convert|11|by|48|ft}} of {{convert|5/16|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} steel.{{sfn|Stonehouse|2006|pp=9, 15&ndash;16.}} Originally coal-fired, the boat's boilers were converted to burn [[Residual fuel|oil]] during the 1971&ndash;72 winter layup.{{sfn|Stonehouse|2006|pp=14, 20.}} In 1969, the ship's maneuverability was improved by the installation of a diesel-powered [[bow thruster]].{{sfn|Schumacher|2005|p=19}}

By ore freighter standards the interior of the ''Fitzgerald'' was luxurious. Her S.L. Hudson Company-designed furnishings included deep pile carpeting, tiled bathrooms, drapes over the [[porthole]]s, and leather swivel chairs in the guest lounge. There were two guest state rooms for passengers.{{sfn|Schumacher|2005|pp=16<U+2013>17}} Air conditioning extended to the crew quarters, which featured more amenities than usual. A large [[galley (kitchen)|galley]] and fully stocked pantry supplied meals for two dining rooms. The ''Fitzgerald'' [[pilothouse]] was outfitted with "state-of-the-art nautical equipment and a beautiful map room."{{sfn|Schumacher|2005|pp=16<U+2013>17}}

Northwestern named the boat after President and Chairman of the Board, Edmund Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald's grandfather had been a lake captain and his father owned the Milwaukee Drydock Company that built and repaired ships.{{sfn|Zielinski|2005|p=112}} More than 15,000 people attended the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s [[Ship naming and launching|christening and launch]] ceremony on June 7, 1958. The event was plagued by misfortune. When Elizabeth Fitzgerald, wife of Edmund Fitzgerald, tried to christen the boat by smashing a champagne bottle over the bow, it took her three attempts to break it. A delay of 36 minutes followed while the shipyard crew struggled to release the keel blocks. Upon sideways launch, the boat crashed violently into a pier.{{sfn|Schumacher|2005|p=15}} On September 22, 1958, ''Fitzgerald'' completed nine days of [[sea trial]]s.{{sfn|Andra-Warner|2006|p=21}}

===Career===

Northwestern's normal practice was to purchase ships for operation by other companies.{{sfn|"J. Burton Ayers"|1961|p=112}} In the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s case they signed a 25-year contract with Oglebay Norton Corporation to operate the vessel.{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|p=226}} Oglebay Norton immediately designated the ''Fitzgerald'' [[flagship]] of its Columbia Transportation fleet.{{sfn|Schumacher|2005|pp=16<U+2013>17}}

The ''Fitzgerald'' was a record-setting "workhorse", often beating her own milestones.{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=164}} The vessel's record load for a single trip was {{convert|27402|LT|ST t|0}} in 1969.{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=164}} For 17 years the ''Fitzgerald'' carried [[taconite]] from [[Iron Range|Minnesota's Iron Range]] mines near Duluth, Minnesota, to iron works in Detroit, Toledo, and other ports. She set seasonal haul records six different times.{{sfn|Kantar|1998|p=9}} Her nicknames included "Fitz", "Pride of the American Flag",{{sfn|Kantar|1998|p=6}} "Mighty Fitz", "Toledo Express",{{sfn|Schumacher|2005|pp=9<U+2013>10}} "Big Fitz",{{sfn|Edwards|2000|p=5}} and the "''Titanic'' of the Great Lakes".{{sfn|Kantar|1998|p=43}} Loading the ''Fitzgerald'' with taconite pellets took about four and a half hours while unloading took around 14&nbsp;hours. A round trip between [[Superior, Wisconsin]], and Detroit, Michigan, usually took her five days and she averaged 47&nbsp;similar trips per season.{{sfn|Stonehouse|2006|p=28}} The vessel's usual route was between Superior, Wisconsin, and Toledo, Ohio, although her port of destination could vary.{{sfn|Schumacher|2005|pp=9<U+2013>10}} By November 1975, the ''Fitzgerald'' had logged an estimated 748&nbsp;round trips on the Great Lakes and covered more than a million miles, "a distance roughly equivalent to 44&nbsp;trips around the world."{{sfn|MacInnis|1998|p=30}}

Up until a few weeks before her loss, passengers had traveled on board as company guests. Frederick Stonehouse wrote: {{Quotation|Stewards treated the guests to the entire VIP routine. The cuisine was reportedly excellent and snacks were always available in the lounge. A small but well stocked kitchenette provided the drinks. Once each trip the captain held a candlelight dinner for the guests, complete with mess-jacketed stewards and special 'clamdigger' punch.{{sfn|Stonehouse|2006|pp=13<U+2013>14}}}}

Because of her size, appearance, string of records, and "DJ captain",{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=164}} the ''Fitzgerald'' became a favorite of boat watchers throughout her career. Although Captain Peter Pulcer was in command of the ''Fitzgerald'' on trips when cargo records were set, "he is best remembered ... for piping music day or night over the ship's intercom system" while passing through the [[St. Clair River|St. Clair]] and [[Detroit River]]s.{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=164}} While navigating the [[Soo Locks]] he would often come out of the pilothouse and use a bullhorn to entertain tourists with a commentary on details about the ''Fitzgerald''.{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=164}}

In 1969, the ''Fitzgerald'' received a safety award for eight years of operation without a time-off worker injury.{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=164}} The vessel ran aground in 1969 and collided with the SS ''Hochelaga'' in 1970. Later that same year she struck the wall of a [[Lock (water transport)|lock]], an accident repeated in 1973 and 1974. During 1974 she lost her original bow anchor in the Detroit River.{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=85}} None of these mishaps were considered serious or unusual.{{sfn|Schumacher|2005|p=18}} Freshwater ships were built to last more than half a century, and the ''Fitzgerald'' should still have had a long career ahead of her when she sank.{{sfn|Schumacher|2005|p=14}}

===Final voyage and wreck===
[[Image:Edmund Fitzgerald Trackline.jpg|thumb|left|280px|alt=Map of ''Fitzgerald's'' probable course on final voyage |National Transportation Safety Board map of probable course of ''Edmund Fitzgerald'' and ''Arthur M. Anderson'' (Click to enlarge)]]
The ''Fitzgerald'' left Superior, Wisconsin, at 2:15&nbsp;p.m. on the afternoon of November&nbsp;9, 1975,{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|p=218}} under the command of Captain [[Ernest M. McSorley]]. She was en route to the steel mill on [[Zug Island]], near Detroit, Michigan,{{sfn|Lawrence|2010}} with a cargo of {{convert|26116|LT|ST t}} of taconite ore pellets and soon reached her full speed of {{convert|16.3|mph|kn km/h}}.{{sfn|NTSB|1978|p=4}} Around 5:00&nbsp;p.m., the ''Fitzgerald'' joined a second freighter under the command of Captain Jesse B. "Bernie" Cooper, the ''[[SS Arthur M. Anderson|Arthur M. Anderson]]'', destined for [[Gary, Indiana]], out of [[Two Harbors, Minnesota]].{{sfn|USCG|1977|p=22}} The weather forecast was not unusual for November and the [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) predicted that a storm would pass just south of Lake Superior by 7:00&nbsp;a.m. on November&nbsp;10.{{sfn|NTSB|1978|p=10}}

The SS ''Wilfred Sykes'' loaded opposite the ''Fitzgerald'' at the Burlington Northern Dock&nbsp;#1 and departed at 4:15&nbsp;p.m., about two hours after the ''Fitzgerald''. In contrast to the NWS forecast, Captain Dudley J. Paquette of the ''Sykes'' predicted that a major storm would directly cross Lake Superior. From the outset, he chose a route that took advantage of the protection offered by the lake's north shore in order to avoid the worst effects of the storm. The crew of the ''Sykes'' followed the radio conversations between the ''Fitzgerald'' and the ''Anderson'' during the first part of their trip and overheard their captains deciding to take the regular Lake Carriers' Association [[downbound]] route.{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=14}} The NWS altered its forecast at 7:00&nbsp;p.m., issuing [[gale warning]]s for the whole of Lake Superior.{{sfn|USCG|1977|p=18}} The ''Anderson'' and the ''Fitzgerald'' altered course northward seeking shelter along the Canadian coast{{sfn|USCG|1977|p=22}} where they encountered a massive winter storm at 1:00&nbsp;a.m. on November&nbsp;10. The ''Fitzgerald'' reported winds of {{convert|52|kn}} and waves {{convert|10|ft|m|1}} high.{{sfn|USCG|1977|p=20}} Captain Paquette of the ''Sykes'' reported that after 1:00&nbsp;a.m., he overheard McSorley say that he had reduced the ship's speed because of the rough conditions. Paquette said he was stunned to later hear McSorley, who was not known for turning aside or slowing down, state, "we're going to try for some [[Windward and leeward|lee]] from [[Isle Royale]]. You're walking away from us anyway ... I can't stay with you."{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=14}}

At 2:00&nbsp;a.m. on November&nbsp;10, the NWS upgraded their warnings from gale to storm, forecasting winds of {{convert|35|-|50|kn}}.{{sfn|USCG|1977|p=19}} Until then, the ''Fitzgerald'' had followed the ''Anderson'', which was travelling at a constant {{convert|14.6|mph|kn km/h}},{{sfn|USCG|1977|p=22}} but the faster ''Fitzgerald'' pulled ahead at about 3:00&nbsp;a.m.{{sfn|NTSB|1978|p=5}} As the storm center passed over the ships, they experienced shifting winds, with wind speeds temporarily dropping as wind direction changed from northeast to south and then northwest.{{sfn|USCG|1977|p=20}} After 1:50&nbsp;p.m., when the ''Anderson'' logged winds of {{convert|5|kn}}, wind speeds again picked up rapidly and it began to snow at 2:45&nbsp;p.m., reducing visibility; the ''Anderson'' lost sight of the ''Fitzgerald'', which was about {{convert|16|mi}} ahead at the time.{{sfn|USCG|1977|pp=24<U+2013>25}}

Shortly after 3:30&nbsp;p.m., Captain McSorley radioed the ''Anderson'' to report that the ''Fitzgerald'' was taking on water and had lost two vent covers and a fence railing. The vessel had also developed a [[List (watercraft)|list]].{{sfn|USCG|1977|p=26}} Two of the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s six [[bilge pump]]s ran continuously to discharge shipped water.{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=6}} McSorley said that he would slow his ship down so that the ''Anderson'' could close the gap between them.{{sfn|USCG|1977|p=26}} In a broadcast shortly afterward, the [[United States Coast Guard]] (USCG) warned all shipping that the [[Soo Locks]] had been closed and they should seek safe anchorage. Shortly after 4:10&nbsp;p.m., McSorley called the ''Anderson'' again to report a radar failure and asked the ''Anderson'' to keep track of them.{{sfn|USCG|1977|p=27}} The ''Fitzgerald'', effectively blind, slowed to let the ''Anderson'' come within a {{convert|10|mi|adj=on}} range so she could receive radar guidance from the other ship.{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|p=219}}

For a time the ''Anderson'' directed the ''Fitzgerald'' toward the relative safety of [[Whitefish Bay]]; then at 4:39&nbsp;p.m., McSorley contacted the USCG station in [[Grand Marais, Michigan]], to inquire if the [[Whitefish Point Light|Whitefish Point light]] and navigation [[Electric beacon|beacon]] were operational. The USCG replied that their monitoring equipment indicated that both instruments were inactive.{{sfn|USCG|1977|p=84}} McSorley then hailed any ships in the Whitefish Point area to report the state of the navigational aids, receiving an answer from Captain Cedric Woodard of the ''Avafors'' between 5:00 and 5:30&nbsp;p.m. that the Whitefish point light was on but not the radio beacon.{{sfn|NTSB|1978|p=5}} Woodward testified to the Marine Board that he overheard McSorley say, "Don't allow nobody on deck",{{sfn|NTSB|1978|p=6}} as well as something about a vent that Woodward could not understand.{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=106}} Some time later, McSorley told Woodward that "I have a 'bad list', I have lost both radars, and am taking heavy seas over the deck in one of the worst seas I have ever been in".{{sfn|NTSB|1978|p=18}}

By late in the afternoon of November&nbsp;10, sustained winds of over {{convert|50|kn}} were recorded by ships and observation points across eastern Lake Superior.{{sfn|NTSB|1978|p=11}} The ''Anderson'' logged sustained winds as high as {{convert|58|kn}} at 4:52&nbsp;p.m.,{{sfn|USCG|1977|p=27}} while waves increased to as high as {{convert|25|ft}} by 6:00&nbsp;p.m.{{sfn|USCG|1977|p=28}} The ''Anderson'' was also struck by {{convert|70|to|75|kn|adj=on}} gusts{{sfn|NTSB|1978|p=11}} and [[Rogue wave (oceanography)|rogue waves]] as high as {{convert|35|ft}}.{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|p=226}}

The last communication from the doomed ship came at approximately 7:10&nbsp;p.m., when the ''Anderson'' notified the ''Fitzgerald'' of an [[upbound]] ship and asked how she was doing. McSorley reported, "We are holding our own." She sank minutes later. No distress signal was received, and ten minutes later the ''Anderson'' could neither raise the ''Fitzgerald'' by radio, nor detect her on radar.{{sfn|NTSB|1978|p=6}}

===Search===
[[File:Edmund fitz lifeboat.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Edmund Fitzgerald lifeboat |One of the ''Edmund Fitzgerald's'' lifeboats, on display at the Valley Camp museum ship]]
Captain Cooper of the ''Anderson'' first called the USCG in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]] at 7:39&nbsp;p.m. on channel&nbsp;16, the radio distress frequency. The USCG responders instructed him to call back on channel&nbsp;12 because they wanted to keep their emergency channel open and they were having difficulty with their communication systems, including antennas blown down by the storm.{{sfn|Schumacher|2005|p=79}} Cooper then contacted the upbound saltwater vessel ''Nanfri'' and was told that she could not pick up the ''Fitzgerald'' on her radar. Despite repeated attempts to raise the USCG, Cooper was not successful until 7:54&nbsp;p.m. when the officer on duty asked him to keep watch for a {{convert|16|ft|m|adj=on}} outboard lost in the area.{{sfn|Hemming|1981|p=193}} At about 8:25&nbsp;p.m., Cooper again called the USCG to express his concern about the ''Fitzgerald''{{sfn|USCG|1977|p=30}} and at 9:03&nbsp;p.m. reported her missing.{{sfn|USCG|1977|p=34}} Petty Officer Philip Branch later testified, "I considered it serious, but at the time it was not urgent."{{sfn|Schumacher|2005|p=83}}

Lacking appropriate search-and-rescue vessels to respond to the ''Fitzgerald'' disaster,{{sfn|Schumacher|2005|p=83}} at approximately 9:00&nbsp;p.m., the USCG asked the ''Anderson'' to turn around and look for survivors. Around 10:30&nbsp;p.m., the USCG asked all commercial vessels anchored in or near Whitefish Bay to assist in the search.{{sfn|USCG|1977|p=36}} The initial search for survivors was carried out by the ''Anderson'', and a second freighter, the [[SS William Clay Ford|SS ''William Clay Ford'']]. The efforts of a third freighter, the Canadian vessel ''[[Hilda Marjanne]]'', were foiled by the weather. The USCG sent a [[buoy tender]], [[USCGC Woodrush (WLB-407)|''Woodrush'']], from Duluth, Minnesota, but it took two and a half hours to launch and a day to arrive at the search area. The [[Traverse City, Michigan]], USCG station launched a [[Grumman HU-16 Albatross|HU-16]] fixed-wing search aircraft that arrived on the scene at 10:53&nbsp;p.m. while a [[Sikorsky S-62|HH-52]] USCG helicopter with a 3.8-million-[[candlepower]] searchlight arrived at 1:00&nbsp;a.m. on November&nbsp;11.{{sfn|Hemming|1981|p=195}} [[Canadian Coast Guard]] aircraft joined the three-day search and the [[Ontario Provincial Police]] established and maintained a beach patrol all along the eastern shore of Lake Superior.{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|p=221}}

Although the search recovered debris, including lifeboats and rafts, no survivors were found.{{sfn|Schumacher|2005|p=97}} On her final voyage the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s crew of 29 consisted of the [[Captain (nautical)|captain]], the [[First mate|first]], [[Second mate|second]] and [[third mate]]s, five [[Seafarer's professions and ranks|engineers]], three [[Oiler (occupation)|oilers]], a cook, a [[Wiper (occupation)|wiper]], two maintenance men, three watchmen, three [[deckhand]]s, three [[wheelsmen]], two porters, a cadet and a [[Chief steward|steward]]. Most of the crew was from Ohio and Wisconsin;{{sfn|Nolan|2000}} their ages ranged from 21-year-old deckhand Mark Andrew Thomas to Captain McSorley, 63&nbsp;years old and planning his retirement.{{sfn|Schumacher|2005|p=190}}

The ''Fitzgerald'' is amongst the largest and best-known vessels lost on the Great Lakes{{sfn|Swayze|1992|p=87}} but she is not alone on the Lake Superior seabed in that area. In the years between 1816, when the ''Invincible'' was lost, to the sinking of the ''Fitzgerald'' in 1975, the [[Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve|Whitefish Point]] area had claimed at least 240&nbsp;ships.{{sfn|Thompson|2000|p=18}}

==Wreck discovery and surveys==
[[Image:Edmond Fitzgerald relative position of wreck.jpg|thumb|right|alt=USCG drawing of wreck site |USCG drawing of the relative positions of the wreck parts]]
===1975 discovery===

A U.S. Navy aircraft equipped to detect [[magnetic anomalies]] usually associated with submarines found the wreck on November&nbsp;14, 1975. The ''Fitzgerald'' lay about {{convert|17|mi|nmi km}} from the entrance of Whitefish Bay, in Canadian waters close to the international boundary at a depth of {{convert|530|ft|m}}.{{sfn|NTSB|1978|p=6}} A further November 14<U+2013>16 survey by the USCG using a [[side scan sonar]] revealed two large objects lying close together on the lake floor. The U.S. Navy also contracted Seaward, Inc., to conduct a second survey between November 22<U+2013>25.{{sfn|Stonehouse|2006|p=58}}

===Underwater surveys===

From May 20 to 28, 1976, the U.S. Navy dived the wreck using its unmanned [[submersible]], [[CURV-III]], and found the ''Fitzgerald'' lying in two large pieces in {{convert|530|ft}} of water. Navy estimates put the length of the bow section at {{convert|276|ft}} and that of the stern section at {{convert|253|ft}}. The bow section stood upright in the mud, some {{convert|170|ft}} from the stern section that lay face down at a 50-degree angle from the bow. The ship's mid-section had been reduced to heaps of metal and taconite.{{sfn|Hemming|1981|pp=211<U+2013>213}}

In 1980, during a Lake Superior research dive expedition, marine explorer [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]], son of [[Jacques Cousteau]], sent two divers from the [[RV Calypso|RV ''Calypso'']] in the first manned submersible dive to the ''Fitzgerald''.{{sfn|Hudson|2005|p=3}} The dive was brief, and although the dive team drew no final conclusions, they speculated that the ''Fitzgerald'' had broken up on the surface.{{sfn|Nuytten|2005|p=37}}

The [[National Sea Grant Program|Michigan Sea Grant Program]] organized a three-day dive using a [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]] (ROV) to survey the ''Fitzgerald'' in 1989. Participants included the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), the [[National Geographic Society]], the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], the [[Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum|Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society]] (GLSHS), and the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]], the latter providing the RV ''Grayling'' as the support vessel for the ROV.{{sfn|Nuytten|2005|p=39}} The GLSHS used part of the five hours of video footage produced during the dives in a documentary and the National Geographic Society used a segment in a broadcast. Frederick Stonehouse, who wrote one of the first books on the ''Fitzgerald'' wreck, moderated a 1990 panel review of the video that drew no conclusions about the cause of the ''Fitzgerald''{{'s}} sinking.{{sfn|Stonehouse|2006|p=217}}

Canadian explorer Joseph MacInnis organized and led six publicly funded dives to the ''Fitzgerald'' over a three-day period in 1994.{{sfn|Stonehouse|2006|p=209}} [[Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution]] provided the ''Edwin A. Link'' as the support vessel, and their manned submersible, the ''Clelia''.{{sfn|Nuytten|2005|p=39}} The GLSHS paid $10,000 for three of its members to each join a dive and take still pictures.{{sfn|MacInnis|1998|p=100}} MacInnis concluded that the notes and video obtained during the dives did not provide an explanation why the ''Fitzgerald'' sank.{{sfn|MacInnis|1998|p=98}} The same year, longtime sport diver Fred Shannon formed Deepquest Ltd., and organized a privately funded dive to the wreck of the ''Fitzgerald'', using Delta Oceanographic's submersible ''Delta''.{{sfn|McCosh|1996|p=94}} Deepquest Ltd. conducted seven dives and took more than 42 hours of underwater video{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=86}} while Shannon set the record for the longest submersible dive to the ''Fitzgerald'' at 211 minutes.{{sfn|Shannon|2010|p=91}} Prior to conducting the dives, Shannon studied NOAA navigational charts and found that the international boundary had changed three times before its publication by NOAA in 1976.{{sfn|Shannon|2009|p=52}} Shannon determined that based on GPS coordinates from the 1994 Deepquest expedition, "at least one-third of the two acres of immediate wreckage containing the two major portions of the vessel is in U.S. waters because of an error in the position of the U.S.<U+2013>Canada boundary line shown on official lake charts."{{sfn|Shannon|1995|p=24}}

Shannon's group discovered the remains of a crew member wearing a life jacket lying alongside the bow of the ship, indicating that at least one of the crew was aware of the possibility of sinking.{{sfn|Thompson|2000|p=326}} The life jacket had deteriorated canvas and "what is thought to be six rectangular cork blocks ... clearly visible."{{sfn|Stonehouse|2006|p=222}} Shannon concluded that "massive and advancing structural failure" caused the ''Fitzgerald'' to break apart on the surface and sink.{{sfn|Lawrence|2010}}

MacInnis led another series of dives in 1995 to salvage the bell from the ''Fitzgerald''.{{sfn|Stonehouse|2006|p=224}} Canadian engineer [[Phil Nuytten]]'s [[atmospheric diving suit]], known as the "[[Newtsuit]]", was used to retrieve the bell from the ship, replace it with a replica, and put a beer can in the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s pilothouse.{{sfn|Farnquist|1996|pp=40, 47}} That same year, Terrence Tysall and Mike Zee set multiple records when they used [[Trimix (breathing gas)|trimix gas]] to scuba dive to the ''Fitzgerald''. The pair are the only people known to have touched the ''Fitzgerald'' wreck. They also set records for the deepest scuba dive on the Great Lakes and the deepest shipwreck dive, and were the first divers to reach the ''Fitzgerald'' without the aid of a submersible. It took six minutes to reach the wreck, six minutes to survey it, and three hours to resurface to avoid [[decompression sickness]], also known as "the bends".{{sfn|Fallstrom|1995}}

===Restrictions on surveys===

Under the [[Ontario Heritage Act]], activities on registered archeological sites require a license.{{sfn|Ontario Heritage Act|1990|loc=<U+00A7>48(1)}} In March 2005, the Whitefish Point Preservation Society accused the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS) of conducting an unauthorized dive to the ''Fitzgerald''. Although he admitted to conducting a sonar scan of the wreck in 2002, the director of the GLHS denied such a survey required a license at the time it was carried out.{{sfn|Bellerose|2005}}

An April 2005 amendment to the Ontario Heritage Act allowed the Ontario government to impose a license requirement on dives, the operation of submersibles, side scan sonars or underwater cameras within a designated radius around protected sites.{{sfn|Ontario Heritage Amendment Act|2005|loc=<U+00A7>35}}{{sfn|Pollack|2005}} Conducting any of those activities without a license would result in fine of up to $1&nbsp;million in Canadian dollars.{{sfn|Ontario Heritage Amendment Act|2005|loc=<U+00A7>44}} On the basis of the amended law, to protect wreck sites considered "watery graves", the Ontario government issued updated regulations in January 2006, including an area with a {{convert|500|m|ft|0|adj=on|sp=us}} radius around the ''Fitzgerald'' and other specifically designated marine archeological sites.{{sfn|Blake|2006}}{{sfn|Marine Archaeological Sites|2006|loc=<U+00A7>1(2)}} In 2009, a further amendment to the Ontario Heritage Act imposed licensing requirements on any type of surveying device.{{sfn|Good Government Act|2005|loc=Sched. 11 <U+00A7>6(15)}}

==Theories on the cause of sinking==

[[File:Edmund Fitzgerald-USACE.jpg|thumb |250px |right |alt=SS Edmund Fitzgerald underway |SS ''Edmund Fitzgerald'' underway]]
Extreme weather and sea conditions play a role in all of the published theories regarding the ''Fitzgerald''{{'s}} sinking but they differ on the other causal factors.{{sfn|Hultquist|Dutter|Schwab|2006|pp=607<U+2013>608}}

===Waves and weather theory===

In 2005 NOAA and the NWS ran a computer simulation, including weather and wave conditions, covering the period from November&nbsp;9, 1975 until the early morning of November&nbsp;11.{{sfn|Hultquist|Dutter|Schwab|2006|p=611}} Analysis of the simulation showed that two separate areas of high wind appeared over Lake Superior at 4:00&nbsp;p.m. on November&nbsp;10. One had speeds in excess of {{convert|43|kn}} and the other winds in excess of {{convert|40|kn}}.{{sfn|Hultquist|Dutter|Schwab|2006|p=616}} The southeastern part of the lake, the direction in which the ''Fitzgerald'' was heading, had the highest winds. Average wave heights increased to near {{convert|19|ft}} by 7:00&nbsp;p.m., November&nbsp;10, and winds exceeded {{convert|50|mph|kn km/h|abbr=on}} over most of southeastern Lake Superior.{{sfn|Hultquist|Dutter|Schwab|2006|p=620}}

The ''Fitzgerald'' sank at the eastern edge of the area of high wind{{sfn|Hultquist|Dutter|Schwab|2006|p=617}} where the long [[Fetch (geography)|fetch]], or distance that wind blows over water, produced significant waves averaging over {{convert|23|ft}} by 7:00&nbsp;p.m. and over {{convert|25|ft}} at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. The simulation also showed one in 100&nbsp;waves reaching {{convert|36|ft}} and one out of every&nbsp;1,000 reaching {{convert|46|ft}}. Since the ship was heading east-southeastward, the waves likely caused the ''Fitzgerald'' to roll heavily.{{sfn|Johnson|2010}}

At the time of the sinking, the ship ''Arthur M. Anderson'' reported northwest winds of {{convert|57|mph|kn km/h|abbr=on}}, which matches the simulation analysis result of {{convert|54|mph|kn km/h|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Johnson|2010}} The analysis further showed that the maximum sustained winds reached near [[Saffir<U+2013>Simpson Hurricane Scale|hurricane force]] of about {{convert|70|mph|kn km/h|abbr=on}} with gusts to {{convert|86|mph|kn km/h}} at the time and location where the ''Fitzgerald'' sank.{{sfn|Hultquist|Dutter|Schwab|2006|p=620}}

===Rogue wave theory===

A group of three [[rogue wave (oceanography)|rogue waves]], often called "three sisters",{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|pp=226<U+2013>227}} was reported in the vicinity of the ''Fitzgerald'' at the time she sank.{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=85}}{{sfn|Thompson|2000|p=324}} The "three sisters" phenomenon is said to occur on Lake Superior as a result of a sequence of three rogue waves forming that are one-third larger than normal waves. When the first wave hits a ship's deck, before its water drains away the second wave strikes. The third incoming wave adds to the two accumulated backwashes suddenly overloading the deck with tons of water.{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=85}}

Captain Cooper of the ''Anderson'' reported that his ship was "hit by two 30 to 35 foot seas about 6:30&nbsp;p.m., one burying the after cabins and damaging a lifeboat by pushing it right down onto the saddle. The second wave of this size, perhaps 35 foot, came over the bridge deck."{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|pp=226<U+2013>227}} Cooper went on to say that these two waves, possibly followed by a third, continued in the direction of the ''Fitzgerald'' and would have struck about the time she sank.{{sfn|Thompson|2000|p=324}} This theory postulates that the "three sisters" compounded the twin problems of the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s known list and her slower speed in heavy seas that already allowed water to remain on her deck for longer than usual.{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|pp=226<U+2013>227}}

===Cargo-hold flooding theory===

The July&nbsp;26, 1977, USCG Marine Casualty Report suggested that the accident was caused by ineffective hatch closures.{{sfn|USCG|1977|p=2}} The report concluded that these devices failed to prevent waves from inundating the cargo hold. The flooding occurred gradually and probably imperceptibly throughout the final day, finally resulting in a fatal loss of buoyancy and stability. As a result, the boat plummeted to the bottom without warning.{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|p=223}} However, video footage of the ''Fitzgerald'' wreck site showed that most of her hatch clamps were in perfect condition. The USCG Marine board concluded that the few damaged clamps were probably the only ones fastened. As a result ineffective hatch closure caused the ''Fitzgerald'' to flood and founder.{{sfn|USCG|1977|p=94}}

From the beginning of the USCG inquiry, some of the crewmen's families and various labor organizations believed the USCG findings could be tainted because there were serious questions regarding their preparedness as well as licensing and rules changes.{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|p=222}} Paul Trimble, a retired USCG vice admiral and president of the Lake Carriers Association (LCA), wrote a letter to the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) on September&nbsp;16, 1977, that included the following statements of objection to the USCG findings:{{Quotation|The present hatch covers are an advanced design and are considered by the entire lake shipping industry to be the most significant improvement over the telescoping leaf covers previously used for many years ... The one-piece hatch covers have proven completely satisfactory in all weather conditions without a single vessel loss in almost 40&nbsp;years of use ... and no water accumulation in cargo holds ...{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=12}}}}
It was common practice for ore freighters, even in foul weather, to embark with not all cargo clamps locked in place on the hatch covers. Maritime author Wolff reported that depending on weather conditions, all the clamps were eventually set within one to two days.{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|p=227-28}} Captain Paquette of the ''Wilfred Sykes'' was dismissive of suggestions that unlocked hatch clamps caused the ''Fitzgerald'' to founder. He said that he commonly sailed in fine weather using the minimum number of clamps necessary to secure the hatch covers.{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=83}}

The May&nbsp;4, 1978, NTSB findings differed from the USCG. The NTSB made the following observations based on the CURV-III survey: {{Quotation|The No.&nbsp;1 hatch cover was entirely inside the No.&nbsp;1 hatch and showed indications of buckling from external loading. Sections of the coaming in way of the No.&nbsp;1 hatch were fractured and buckled inward. The No.&nbsp;2 hatch cover was missing and the coaming on the No.&nbsp;2 hatch was fractured and buckled. Hatches Nos.&nbsp;3 and 4 were covered with mud; however, one corner of hatch cover No.&nbsp;3 could be seen in place. Hatch cover No.&nbsp;5 was missing. A series of 16&nbsp;consecutive hatch cover clamps were observed on the No.&nbsp;5 hatch coaming. Of this series, the first and eighth were distorted or broken. All of the 14&nbsp;other clamps were undamaged and in the open position. The No.&nbsp;6 hatch was open and a hatch cover was standing on end vertically in the hatch. The hatch covers were missing from hatches Nos.&nbsp;7 and 8 and both coamings were fractured and severely distorted. The bow section abruptly ended just aft of hatch No.&nbsp;8 and the deck plating was ripped up from the separation to the forward end of hatch No.&nbsp;7.{{sfn|NTSB|1978|p=12}}}}

The NTSB conducted computer studies,{{sfn|Stonehouse|2006|p=181}} testing and analysis to determine the forces necessary to collapse the hatch covers{{sfn|NTSB|1978|p=14}} and concluded that the ''Fitzgerald'' sank suddenly from massive flooding of the cargo hold "due to the collapse of one or more of the hatch covers under the weight of giant boarding seas" instead of flooding gradually due to ineffective hatch closures.{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|p=224}} However, the NTSB dissenting opinion held that the ''Fitzgerald'' sank suddenly and unexpectedly from [[shoal]]ing.{{sfn|Stonehouse|2006|p=190}}

===Shoaling theory===

The LCA believed that instead of hatch cover leakage, the more probable cause of the ''Fitzgerald'' loss was [[shoal]]ing or grounding in the Six Fathom Shoal northwest of [[Caribou Island (Lake Superior)|Caribou Island]] when the vessel "unknowingly raked a [[reef]]" during the time the Whitefish Point light and radio beacon were not available as navigation aids.{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|p=224}} This theory was supported by a 1976&nbsp;Canadian hydrographic survey, which disclosed that an unknown shoal ran a mile further east of Six Fathom Shoal than shown on the Canadian charts. Officers from the ''Anderson'' observed that the ''Fitzgerald'' sailed through this exact area.{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|p=224}} Conjecture by proponents of the Six Fathom Shoal theory concluded that the ''Fitzgerald's'' downed fence rail reported by McSorley could occur only if the ship "hogged" during shoaling, with the bow and stern bent downward and the midsection raised by the shoal, pulling the railing tight until the cables dislodged or tore under the strain.{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=6}} However, divers searched the Six Fathom Shoal after the wreck occurred and found no evidence of "a recent collision or grounding anywhere."{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=9}} Maritime authors Bishop and Stonehouse wrote that the shoaling theory was later challenged on the basis of the higher quality of detail in Shannon's 1994&nbsp;photography that "explicitly show[s] the devastation of the ''Fitzgerald''."{{sfn|Stonehouse|2006|p=222}} Shannon's photography of the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s overturned stern showed "no evidence on the bottom of the stern, the propeller or the rudder of the ship that would indicate the ship struck a shoal."{{sfn|Bishop|2000|pp=8<U+2013>9}}

Maritime author Stonehouse reasoned that "unlike the Lake Carriers, the Coast Guard had no vested interest in the outcome of their investigation."{{sfn|Stonehouse|2006|p=83}} Author Bishop reported that Captain Paquette of the ''Wilfred Sykes'' argued that through their support for the shoaling explanation, the LCA represented the shipping company's interests by advocating a theory that held LCA member companies, the [[American Bureau of Shipping]], and the U.S. Coast Guard Service blameless.{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=9}}

Paul Hainault, a retired professor of mechanical engineering from [[Michigan Technological University]], promoted a theory that began as a student class project. His hypothesis held that the ''Fitzgerald'' grounded at 9:30&nbsp;a.m. on November&nbsp;10 on [[Superior Shoal]]. This shoal, charted in 1929, is an underwater mountain in the middle of Lake Superior about {{convert|50|mi}} north of [[Copper Harbor, Michigan]].{{sfn|Stonehouse|2006|p=239}} It has sharp peaks that rise nearly to the lake surface with water depths ranging from {{convert|22|to|400|ft}}, making it a menace to navigation. Discovery of the shoal resulted in a change in recommended shipping routes.{{sfn|Woodford|1994|p=121}} A [[seiche]], or standing wave, that occurred during the low-pressure system over Lake Superior on November&nbsp;10, 1975, caused the lake to rise {{convert|3|ft}} over the Soo Locks' gates to flood Portage Avenue in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, with {{convert|1|ft|1}} of water.{{sfn|Kight|1975}} Hainault's theory held that this seiche contributed to the ''Fitzgerald'' shoaling {{convert|200|ft}} of her hull on Superior Shoal, causing the hull to be punctured mid-body. The hypothesis contended that the wave action continued to damage the hull, until the middle third dropped out like a box, leaving the ship held together by the center deck. The stern section acted as an anchor and caused the ''Fitzgerald'' to come to a full stop, causing everything to go forward. The ship broke apart on the surface within seconds. Compressed air pressure blew a hole in the starboard bow, which sank 18&nbsp;degrees off course. The rear kept going forward with the engine still running, rolled to port and landed bottom up.{{sfn|Stonehouse|2006|pp=240<U+2013>241}}

===Structural failure theory===

Another published theory contends that an already weakened structure, and modification of the ''Fitzgerald''{{'s}} winter [[Ship's load line|load line]] (that allows heavier loading and travel lower in the water), made it possible for large waves to cause a stress fracture in the hull. This is based on the "regular" huge waves of the storm and does not necessarily involve rogue waves.{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=84}}

The USCG and NTSB investigated whether the ''Fitzgerald'' broke apart due to structural failure of the hull and because the 1976 CURV&nbsp;III survey found the ''Fitzgerald'' sections were {{convert|170|ft}} from each other, the USCG's formal casualty report of July&nbsp;1977 concluded that she had separated upon hitting the lake floor.{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|p=223}} The NTSB came to the same conclusion as USCG because:{{Quotation|The proximity of the bow and stern sections on the bottom of Lake Superior indicated that the vessel sank in one piece and broke apart either when it hit bottom or as it descended. Therefore, the ''Fitzgerald'' did not sustain a massive structural failure of the hull while on the surface ... The final position of the wreckage indicated that if the ''Fitzgerald'' had capsized, it must have suffered a structural failure before hitting the lake bottom. The bow section would have had to right itself and the stern portion would have had to capsize before coming to rest on the bottom. It is, therefore, concluded that the ''Fitzgerald'' did not capsize on the surface.{{sfn|NTSB|1978|p=18}}}}

However, after maritime historian Frederick Stonehouse moderated the panel reviewing the video footage from the 1989&nbsp;ROV survey of the ''Fitzgerald'', he concluded that the extent of taconite coverage over the wreck site showed that the stern had floated on the surface for a short time and spilled taconite into the forward section; thus the two sections of the wreck did not sink at the same time.{{sfn|Stonehouse|2006|p=217}} The 1994&nbsp;Shannon team found that the stern and the bow were {{convert|255|ft}} apart leading Shannon to conclude that the ''Fitzgerald'' broke up on the surface.{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=86}} He said: {{Quotation|This placement does not support the theory that the ship plunged to the bottom in one piece, breaking apart when it struck bottom. If this were true, the two sections would be much closer. In addition, the angle, repose and mounding of clay and mud at the site indicate the stern rolled over on the surface, spilling taconite ore pellets from its severed cargo hold, and then landed on portions of the cargo itself.{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=86}}}}

The stress fracture theory was supported by the testimony of former crewmen. Former Second Mate Richard Orgel, who served on the ''Fitzgerald'' in 1972 and 1973, testified that "the ship had a tendency to bend and spring during storms 'like a diving board after somebody has jumped off.{{' "}}{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|p=227}} Orgel was quoted as saying that the loss of the ''Fitzgerald'' was caused by hull failure, "pure and simple. I detected undue stress in the side tunnels by examining the white enamel paint, which will crack and splinter when submitted to severe stress."{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=90}} George H. "Red" Burgner, the ''Fitzgerald''{{'s}} [[Chief steward|Steward]] for ten seasons and winter ship-keeper for seven years, testified in a deposition that a "loose [[keel]]" contributed to the vessel's loss. Burgner further testified that "the keel and sister [[kelson]]s were only 'tack welded'" and that he had personally observed that many of the welds were broken.{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|p=228}} Burgner was not asked to testify before the Marine Board of Inquiry.{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|p=227}}

When [[Bethlehem Steel|Bethlehem Steel Corporation]] permanently laid up the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s sister ship, SS ''Arthur B. Homer'', just five years after going to considerable expense to lengthen her, questions were raised as to whether both ships had the same structural problems.{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=92}} The two vessels were built in the same shipyard using welded joints instead of the riveted joints used in older ore freighters. Riveted joints allow a ship to flex and work in heavy seas, while welded joints are more likely to break.{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=92}} Reports indicate that repairs to the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s hull were delayed in 1975 due to plans to lengthen the ship during the upcoming winter layup. The ''Homer'' was lengthened to {{convert|825|ft}} and placed back in service by December&nbsp;1975, not long after the ''Fitzgerald'' foundered. In 1978, without explanation, Bethlehem Steel Corporation denied permission for the chairman of the NTSB to travel on the ''Homer''. The ''Homer'' was permanently laid up in 1980 and broken for scrap in 1987.{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=93}}

Retired GLEW naval architect Raymond Ramsey, one of the design team on the hull of the ''Fitzgerald'',{{sfn|Ramsey|2009|p=48}} reviewed her increased load lines, maintenance history, along with the history of long ship hull failure and concluded that the ''Fitzgerald'' was not seaworthy on November&nbsp;10, 1975.{{sfn|Ramsey|2009|p=16}} He stated that planning the ''Fitzgerald'' to be compatible with the constraints of the St. Lawrence Seaway had placed her hull design in a "straight jacket".{{sfn|Ramsey|2009|p=66}} The ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s long ship design was developed without the benefit of [[Research and development|research, development, test, and evaluation]] principles while computerized analytical technology was not available at the time she was built.{{sfn|Ramsey|2009|p=37}} Ramsey noted that the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s hull was built with an all-welded (instead of riveted) modular fabrication method,{{sfn|Ramsey|2009|p=45}} which was used for the first time in the GLEW shipyard.{{sfn|Schumacher|2005|p=14}}{{sfn|MacInnis|1998|p=21}} Ramsey concluded that increasing the hull length to {{convert|729|ft}} resulted in a L/D slenderness ratio (the ratio of the length of the ship to the depth of her structure){{sfn|Charles|Furness|Crane|1997|p=258}} that caused excessive multi-axial bending and springing of the hull, and that the hull should have been structurally reinforced to cope with her increased length.{{sfn|Ramsey|2009|pp=71, 134}}

===Topside damage theory===

The USCG agreed that topside damage was a reasonable alternative reason for the ''Fitzgerald'' sinking and surmised that damage to the fence rail and vents was possibly caused by a heavy floating object such as a log.{{sfn|Thompson|2000|p=325}} Historian and mariner Mark Thompson instead believes the more plausible explanation that something broke loose from the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s deck. He theorized that the loss of the vents resulted in flooding of two ballast tanks or a ballast tank and a walking tunnel that caused the ship to list. Thompson further conjectured that there was more extensive damage than Captain McSorley could detect in the pilothouse thereby allowing water to flood the cargo hold. He concluded that the topside damage the ''Fitzgerald'' experienced at 3:30&nbsp;p.m. on November&nbsp;10, compounded by the heavy seas, was the most obvious explanation for why she sank. Thompson wrote that to ignore the incontrovertible evidence of the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s topside damage was "analogous to theorizing that ''Titanic'' was sunk by a German U-boat".{{sfn|Thompson|2000|p=328}}

==Possible contributing factors==

The USCG, NTSB, and proponents of alternative theories have all named multiple possible contributing factors to the foundering of the ''Fitzgerald''.

[[File:SS Edmund Fitzgerald scale model.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Scale mode of ''Fitzgerald'' |Scale model of the SS ''Edmund Fitzgerald'']]

===Weather forecasting===

The NWS long range forecast on November&nbsp;9, 1975, predicted that a storm would pass just south of Lake Superior and over the [[Keweenaw Peninsula]], extending into the Lake from Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Captain Paquette of the ''Wilfred Sykes'' had been following and charting the low pressure system over [[Oklahoma]] since November&nbsp;8 and concluded that a major storm would track across eastern Lake Superior. He therefore chose a route that gave the ''Sykes'' the most protection and took refuge in [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]], during the worst of the storm. Based on the NWS forecast, the ''Arthur M. Anderson'' and ''Edmund Fitzgerald'' instead started their trip across Lake Superior following the regular Lake Carriers Association route, which placed them in the path of the storm.{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=xii}} The NTSB investigation concluded that the NWS failed to accurately predict wave heights on November&nbsp;10.{{sfn|NTSB|1978|pp=21, 23}} After running computer models in 2005 using actual meteorological data from November&nbsp;10, 1975, Hulquist of the NWS said of the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s position in the storm, "It ended in precisely the wrong place at the absolute worst time."{{sfn|Bohnak|2007|p=316}}

===Inaccurate navigational charts===

After reviewing testimony that the ''Fitzgerald'' had passed near shoals north of Caribou Island, the USCG Marine Board examined the relevant navigational charts. They found that the Canadian 1973&nbsp;navigational chart for the Six Fathom Shoal area was based on Canadian surveys from 1916 and 1919 and that the 1973&nbsp;U.S. Lake Survey Chart No.&nbsp;9 included the notation, "Canadian Areas. For data concerning Canadian areas, Canadian authorities have been consulted."{{sfn|USCG|1977|pp=85<U+2013>86}} Thereafter, at the request of the Marine Board and the Commander of the USCG Ninth District, the [[Canadian Hydrographic Service]] conducted a survey of the area surrounding [[Michipicoten Island]] and Caribou Island in 1976. The survey revealed that the shoal ran about {{convert|1|mi}} further east than shown on Canadian charts.{{sfn|USCG|1977|pp=86<U+2013>87}} The NTSB investigation concluded that at the time of the ''Fitzgerald'' foundering, Lake Survey Chart No.&nbsp;9 was not detailed enough to indicate Six Fathom Shoal as a hazard to navigation.{{sfn|NTSB|1978|pp=21, 23}}

===Lack of watertight bulkheads===

Mark Thompson, a [[Merchant Navy|merchant seaman]] and author of numerous books on Great Lakes shipping, stated that if her cargo holds had watertight subdivisions, "the ''Fitzgerald'' could have made it into Whitefish Bay."{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=167}} Frederick Stonehouse also held that the lack of watertight [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s caused the ''Fitzgerald'' to sink. He said: {{Quotation|The Great Lakes ore carrier is the most commercially efficient vessel in the shipping trade today. But it's nothing but a motorized barge! It's the unsafest commercial vessel afloat. It has virtually no watertight integrity. Theoretically, a one-inch puncture in the cargo hold will sink it.{{sfn|Stonehouse|2006|p=105<U+2013>106}}}}

Stonehouse called on ship designers and builders to design lake carriers more like ships rather than "motorized super-barges"{{sfn|Stonehouse|2006|p=124}} making the following comparison: {{Quotation|Contrast this [the ''Fitzgerald''] with the story of the SS ''Maumee'', an oceangoing tanker that struck an iceberg near the South Pole recently. The collision tore a hole in the ship's bow large enough to drive a truck through, but the'' Maumee'' was able travel halfway around the world to a repair yard, without difficulty, because she was fitted with watertight bulkheads.{{sfn|Stonehouse|2006|p=117}}}}

After the ''Fitzgerald'' foundered, Great Lakes shipping companies were accused of valuing cargo [[Cargo|payloads]] more than human life,{{sfn|Stonehouse|2006|pp=104<U+2013>105}} since the vessel's cargo hold of {{convert|860950|cuft|m3}} had been divided by two non-watertight traverse "screen" bulkheads. The NTSB ''Fitzgerald'' investigation concluded that Great Lakes freighters should be constructed with watertight bulkheads in their cargo holds.{{sfn|NTSB|1978|p=25}}

The USCG had proposed rules for watertight bulkheads in Great Lakes vessels as far back as the sinking of the [[SS Daniel J. Morrell|''Morrell'']] in 1966 and did so again after the sinking of the ''Fitzgerald'', arguing that this would allow ships to make it to refuge or at least allow crew members to abandon ship in an orderly fashion. The LCA represented the Great Lakes fleet owners and was able to forestall watertight subdivision regulations{{sfn|46 CFR|2010}} by arguing that this would cause economic hardship for vessel operators. A few vessel operators have built Great Lakes ships with watertight subdivisions in the cargo holds since 1975, but most vessels operating on the lakes cannot prevent flooding of the entire cargo hold area.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=168}}

===Lack of instrumentation===

A [[fathometer]] was not required under USCG regulations, and the ''Fitzgerald'' did not have one,{{sfn|USCG|1977|p=9}} although fathometers were available at the time of her sinking. Instead, a [[Sounding line|hand line]] was the only method the ''Fitzgerald'' had to take depth soundings. The hand line consisted of a piece of line knotted at measured intervals with a lead weight on the end. The line was thrown over the bow of the ship and the count of the knots measured the water depth.{{sfn|Stonehouse|2006|p=102}} The NTSB investigation concluded that a fathometer would have provided the ''Fitzgerald'' additional navigational data and made her less dependent on the ''Anderson'' for navigational assistance.{{sfn|NTSB|1978|pp=21, 23}}

The ''Fitzgerald'' had no system to monitor the presence or amount of water in her cargo hold, even though there was always some present. The intensity of the November&nbsp;10 storm would have made it difficult, if not impossible, to access the hatches from the spar deck. The USCG Marine Board found that flooding of the hold could not have been assessed until the water reached the top of the taconite cargo.{{sfn|Schumacher|2005|p=134}} The NTSB investigation concluded that it would have been impossible to pump water from the hold when it was filled with bulk cargo.{{sfn|NTSB|1978|pp=17, 23}} The Marine Board noted that because the ''Fitzgerald'' lacked a draft-reading system, the crew had no way to determine whether the vessel had lost [[Freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] (the level of a ship's deck above the water).{{sfn|Schumacher|2005|p=135}}

===Increased load lines, reduced freeboard===

The USCG increased the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s load line in 1969, 1971, and 1973 to allow {{convert|3|ft|3.25|in|mm|0}} less minimum [[Freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] than the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s original design allowed in 1958.{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|p=223}} This meant that ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s deck was only {{Convert|11.5|ft}} above the water when she faced {{convert|35|ft}} waves during the November&nbsp;10 storm.{{sfn|NTSB|1978|p=8}} Captain Paquette of the ''Sykes'' noted that this change allowed loading to 4,000 tons more than what the ''Fitz'' was designed to carry.{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=137}}

Concerns regarding the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s keel-welding problem surfaced during the time the USCG started increasing her load line.{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|p=228}} This increase and the resultant reduction in freeboard decreased the vessel's critical reserve buoyancy. Prior to the load-line increases she was said to be a "good riding ship" but afterwards the ''Fitzgerald'' became a sluggish ship with slower response and recovery times. Captain McSorley said he did not like the action of a ship he described as a "wiggling thing" that scared him. The ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s bow hooked to one side or the other in heavy seas without recovering and made a groaning sound not heard on other ships.{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|p=228}}

===Maintenance===

NTSB investigators noted that the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s prior [[Ship grounding|groundings]] could have caused undetected damage that led to major structural failure during the storm, since Great Lakes vessels were normally [[drydock]]ed for inspection only once every five years.{{sfn|NTSB|1978|pp=21, 23}} It was also alleged that when compared to the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s previous captain, McSorley did not keep up with routine maintenance and did not confront the mates about getting the requisite work done.{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|p=228}} After August B. Herbel, Jr., president of the [[ASTM International|American Society for Testing and Materials]], examined photographs of the welds on the ''Fitzgerald'', he stated, "the hull was just being held together with patching plates." Other questions were raised as to why the USCG did not discover and take corrective action in its pre-November&nbsp;1975 inspection of the ''Fitzgerald'' given that her hatch coamings, gaskets, and clamps were poorly maintained.{{sfn|Thompson|2000|p=349}}

===Complacency===

On November&nbsp;10, 1975, McSorley reported he had never seen bigger seas in his life.{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|p=221}} Paquette, master of ''Wilfred Sykes'' out in the same storm said, "I'll tell anyone that it was a ''monster'' sea washing solid water over the deck of every vessel out there."{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=108}} The USCG did not broadcast that all ships should seek safe anchorage until after 3:35&nbsp;p.m. on November&nbsp;10, many hours after the weather was upgraded from a gale to a storm.{{sfn|USCG|1977|p=27}}

McSorley was known as a "heavy weather captain"{{sfn|Bishop|2000|pp=22, 76}} who {{" '}}beat hell' out of the ''Fitzgerald'' and 'very seldom ever hauled up for weather{{' "}}.{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|p=228}} Paquette held the opinion that negligence caused the ''Fitzgerald'' to founder. He said, "in my opinion, all the subsequent events arose because (McSorley) kept pushing that ship and didn't have enough training in weather forecasting to use common sense and pick a route out of the worst of the wind and seas."{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=76}} Paquette's vessel was the first to reach a discharge port after the November&nbsp;10 storm; she was met by company attorneys who came aboard the ''Sykes''. He told them that the ''Fitzgerald'' foundering was caused by negligence.{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=30}} Paquette was never asked to testify during the USCG or NTSB investigations.{{sfn|Bishop|2000|p=30}}

The NTSB investigation noted that Great Lakes cargo vessels could normally avoid severe storms, and called for the establishment of a limiting sea state applicable to Great Lakes bulk cargo vessels. This would restrict the operation of vessels in sea states above the limiting value.{{sfn|NTSB|1978|pp=24<U+2013>27}} One concern was that shipping companies pressured the captains to deliver cargo as quickly and cheaply as possible regardless of bad weather.{{sfn|Thompson|2000|p=333}} At the time of the ''Fitzgerald'' foundering, there was no evidence that any governmental regulatory agency tried to control vessel movement in foul weather despite the historical record that hundreds of Great Lakes vessels had been wrecked in storms. The USCG took the position that only the captain could decide when it was safe to sail.{{sfn|Thompson|2000|p=315}}

The USCG Marine Board issued the following conclusion:{{Quotation|The nature of Great Lakes shipping, with short voyages, much of the time in very protected waters, frequently with the same routine from trip to trip, leads to complacency and an overly optimistic attitude concerning the extreme weather conditions that can and do exist. The Marine Board feels that this attitude reflects itself at times in deferral of maintenance and repairs, in failure to prepare properly for heavy weather, and in the conviction that since refuges are near, safety is possible by "running for it." While it is true that sailing conditions are good during the summer season, changes can occur abruptly, with severe storms and extreme weather and sea conditions arising rapidly. This tragic accident points out the need for all persons involved in Great Lakes shipping to foster increased awareness of the hazards which exist.{{sfn|USCG|1977|p=103}}}}

Mark Thompson countered that "the Coast Guard laid bare [its] own complacency" by blaming the sinking of the ''Fitzgerald'' on industry-wide complacency since it had inspected the ''Fitzgerald'' just two weeks before she sank.{{sfn|Thompson|2000|p=349}} The loss of the ''Fitzgerald'' also exposed the USCG's lack of rescue capability on Lake Superior.{{sfn|Stonehouse|2006|p=109}} Thompson said that ongoing budget cuts had limited the USCG's ability to perform its historical functions. He further noted that USCG rescue vessels were unlikely to reach the scene of an incident on Lake Superior or Lake Huron within 6&nbsp;to 12&nbsp;hours of its occurrence.{{sfn|Thompson|2000|p=369}}

==Legal settlement==
Under [[maritime law]], ships fall under the jurisdiction of the [[Admiralty law|admiralty courts]] of their flag country. As ''Fitzgerald'' was sailing under the U.S. flag, even though she sank in foreign (Canadian) waters, she was subject to U.S. admiralty law.{{sfn|Beisenherz|2010}} With a value of $24&nbsp;million, the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s financial loss was the greatest in Great Lakes sailing history.{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|pp=217<U+2013>218}} In addition to the crew, {{convert|26116|LT|ST t}} of taconite sank along with the vessel.{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|p=218}} Two widows of crewmen filed a $1.5&nbsp;million lawsuit against ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s owners Northwestern Mutual and operators Oglebay Norton Corporation one week after she sank. An additional $2.1&nbsp;million lawsuit was later filed. Oglebay Norton subsequently filed a petition in the U.S. District Court seeking to "limit their liability to $817,920 in connection with other suits filed by families of crew members."{{sfn|Ratigan|1977||pp=345<U+2013>346}} The company paid compensation to surviving families about 12&nbsp;months in advance of official findings of the probable cause and on condition of imposed confidentiality agreements.{{sfn|Ramsey|2009|pp=16, 26, 144<U+2013>145}} Robert Hemming, a reporter and newspaper editor, reasoned in his book about the ''Fitzgerald'' that the USCG's conclusions "were benign in placing blame on [n]either the company or the captain ... [and] saved the Oglebay Norton from very expensive lawsuits by the families of the lost crew."{{sfn|Hemming|1981|p=226}}

==Subsequent changes to Great Lakes shipping practice==

The USCG investigation of the ''Fitzgerald'' sinking resulted in 15&nbsp;recommendations regarding load lines, weathertight integrity, search and rescue capability, lifesaving equipment, crew training, loading manuals, and providing information to masters of Great Lakes vessels.{{sfn|USCG|1977|pp=105<U+2013>108}} NTSB's investigation resulted in 19&nbsp;recommendations for the USCG, four recommendations for the American Bureau of Shipping, and two recommendations for NOAA.{{sfn|NTSB|1978|pp=24<U+2013>27}} Of the official recommendations, the following actions and USCG regulations were put in place:
:1. In 1977, the USCG made it a requirement that all vessels of 1,600&nbsp;[[Gross register tonnage|gross register tons]] and over use depth finders.{{sfn|Stonehouse|2006|p=182}}
:2. Since 1980, [[survival suit]]s have been required aboard ship in each crew member's quarters and at their customary work station with strobe lights affixed to life jackets and survival suits.{{sfn|Thompson|2000|p=329}}
:3. A [[LORAN|LORAN-C]] positioning system for navigation on the Great Lakes was implemented in 1980 and later replaced with [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) in the 1990s.{{sfn|Stonehouse|2006|p=187}}
:4. [[Distress radiobeacon|Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons]] (EPIRB) are installed on all Great Lakes vessels for immediate and accurate location in event of a disaster.{{sfn|Thompson|2000|p=329}}
:5. Navigational charts for northeastern Lake Superior were improved for accuracy and greater detail.{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|p=229}}
:6. NOAA revised its method for predicting wave heights.{{sfn|Wolff|Holden|1990|p=229}}
:7. The USCG rescinded the 1973 Load Line Regulation amendment that permitted reduced freeboard loadings.{{sfn|Ramsey|2009|p=78}}
:8. The USCG began the annual pre-November inspection program recommended by the NTSB. "Coast Guard inspectors now board all U.S. ships during the fall to inspect hatch and vent closures and lifesaving equipment."{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=169}}

Karl Bohnak, an Upper Peninsula meteorologist, covered the sinking and storm in a book on local weather history. In this book, Joe Warren, a deckhand on the ''Anderson'' during the November&nbsp;10, 1975, storm, said that the storm changed the way things were done. He stated, "After that, trust me, when a gale came up we dropped the hook [anchor]. We dropped the hook because they found out the big ones could sink."{{sfn|Bohnak|2007|p=318}} However, Mark Thompson wrote, "Since the loss of the ''Fitz'', some captains may be more prone to go to anchor, rather than venturing out in a severe storm, but there are still too many who like to portray themselves as 'heavy weather sailors'."{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=170}}

The day after the wreck, [[Mariners' Church]] in Detroit rang its bell 29&nbsp;times; once for each life lost.{{sfn|Schumacher|2005|p=95}} The church continued to hold an annual memorial, reading the names of the crewmen and ringing the church bell, until 2006 when the church broadened its memorial ceremony to commemorate all lives lost on the Great Lakes.{{sfn|"Detroit church"|2006}}{{sfn|Bulanda|2010}}

The [[Ship's bells|ship's bell]] was recovered from the wreck on July&nbsp;4, 1995. A replica engraved with the names of the 29&nbsp;sailors who lost their lives replaced the original on the wreck.{{sfn|Schumacher|2005|p=167}} A legal document signed by 46&nbsp;relatives of the deceased, officials of the Mariner's Church of Detroit and the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historic Society (GLSHS) "donated the custodian and conservatorship" of the bell to the GLSHS "to be incorporated in a permanent memorial at Whitefish Point, Michigan, to honor the memory of the 29&nbsp;men of the SS ''Edmund Fitzgerald''".{{sfn|Schumacher|2005|p=171}} The terms of the legal agreement made the GLSHS responsible for maintaining the bell, and forbade it from selling or moving the bell or using it for commercial purposes. It provided for transferring the bell to the Mariner's Church of Detroit if the terms were violated.{{sfn|Schumacher|2005|p=171}}

An uproar occurred in 1995 when Jeff Stevens, a maintenance worker in [[St. Ignace]], Michigan, refurbished the bell by stripping the protective coating applied by Michigan State University experts.{{sfn|Poulson|1996}} The controversy continued when the [[Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum]] tried to use the bell as a touring exhibit in 1996. Relatives of the crew halted this move, objecting that the bell was being used as a "traveling trophy".{{sfn|Schumacher|2005|p=172}} The bell is now on display in the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum in [[Whitefish Bay|Whitefish Point]] near [[Paradise, Michigan|Paradise]], Michigan.{{sfn|Walsh-Sarnecki|2005}}

An anchor from ''Fitzgerald'' lost on an earlier trip was recovered from the Detroit River and is on display at the [[Belle Isle Park#Dossin Great Lakes Museum|Dossin Great Lakes Museum]] in Detroit, Michigan.{{sfn|Detroit Historical Society|2011}} The Dossin Great Lakes Museum also hosts a Lost Mariners Remembrance event each year on the evening of November 10. {{sfn|Detroit Historical Society|2011}} Artifacts on display in the [[Steamship Valley Camp]] museum in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan]], include two lifeboats, photos, a movie of the ''Fitzgerald'' and commemorative models and paintings. Every November&nbsp;10 the [[Split Rock Lighthouse]] in [[Silver Bay, Minnesota]] emits a light in honor of the ''Edmund Fitzgerald.''

On August&nbsp;8, 2007, along a remote shore of Lake Superior on the [[Keweenaw Peninsula]], a Michigan family discovered a lone life-saving ring that appeared to have come from the ''Fitzgerald.'' However, it bore markings different from those of proven rings found at the wreck site, and was thought to be a hoax.{{sfn|Karoub|2007}} Later it was determined that the life ring was not from the ''Fitzgerald'', but had been lost by the owner, whose father had made it as a personal memorial.{{sfn|"Fitzgerald relic"|2007}}

===Musical and theater tributes===

In 1976, Canadian singer-songwriter [[Gordon Lightfoot]] wrote, composed, and recorded the song [[The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald|"The Wreck of the ''Edmund Fitzgerald''"]] for his album ''[[Summertime Dream]]''. Lightfoot's popular ballad made the sinking of the ''Fitzgerald'' one of the most well-known disasters in the history of [[Great Lakes]] shipping.{{sfn|Kantar|1998|p=43}} The original lyrics of the song show a degree of artistic license compared to the events of the actual sinking and, in light of new evidence about what happened, Lightfoot has modified one line for live performances.{{sfn|Stevenson|2010}}{{sfn|Quill|2010}} The song has been covered by many performers. The Canadian rock band [[Rheostatics]] recorded it for their second album, ''[[Melville (album)|Melville]]'', and their live album ''[[Double Live (Rheostatics album)|Double Live]]''. [[The Dandy Warhols]] also covered the song in their ''[[The Black Album (The Dandy Warhols album)|The Black Album]]'' in 2004.{{sfn|"They've got"|2005}}

In 1986, writer [[Steven Dietz]] and songwriter/lyricist Eric Peltoniemi wrote the musical ''Ten November'' in memory of the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s sinking. In 2005, the play was re-edited into a concert version called ''The Gales of November'',{{sfn|"Minnesota Public Radio"|2005}} which opened on the 30th anniversary of the sinking at the [[Fitzgerald Theater]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]].{{sfn|Aamot|2005}}

A piano concerto entitled "The ''Edmund Fitzgerald''" was written by American composer Geoffrey Peterson in 2002; it premiered by the [[Sault Symphony Orchestra]] in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada in November 2005 as another 30th anniversary commemoration.{{sfn|Sault Symphony Orchestra|2005}}

===Commercialization===
The fame of the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s image and story have made it public domain and subject to commercialization.{{sfn|Schumacher|2005|p=173}} A "cottage industry"{{sfn|Stonehouse|2006|p=205}} has evolved across the Great Lakes region from Two Harbors, Minnesota, to Whitefish Point, the incident's "[[ground zero]]".{{sfn|Donnelly|2000}} Memorabilia on sale include Christmas ornaments, T-shirts, coffee mugs, ''Edmund Fitzgerald'' beer, videos, and other items commemorating the vessel and its loss.{{sfn|Dybas|2000}}
