'''Proteus syndrome''', also known as '''Wiedemann syndrome''' (named after the German paediatrician Hans-Rudolf Wiedemann), is a [[congenital disorder]]<ref name="Andrews">James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). ''Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology''. (10th ed.). Saunders. ISBN 0-7216-2921-0.</ref>{{rp|554}} that causes [[skin]] overgrowth and atypical [[bone]] development, often accompanied by [[tumor]]s over half the body.<ref name="Fitz2">Freedberg, et al. (2003). ''Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine''. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. ISBN 0-07-138076-0.</ref>{{rp|776}} 

Proteus syndrome is highly variable,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Jamis-Dow C, Turner J, Biesecker L, Choyke P | title=Radiologic manifestations of Proteus syndrome | journal=Radiographics | volume=24 | issue=4 | pages=1051<U+2013>68 | pmid=15256628 | doi=10.1148/rg.244035726 | year=2004}}</ref> and is named after the Greek sea-god [[Proteus]], who could change his shape. 

The condition appears to have been first described in the American medical literature by Drs. Samia Temtamy and John Rogers in 1976<ref>{{cite journal|last=Temtamy|first=Samia|coauthors=Rogers|title=Macrodactyly, hemihypertrophy, and connective tissue nevi: Report of a new syndrome and review of the literature|journal=The Journal of Pediatrics|year=1976|month=December|volume=89|issue=6|pages=924<U+2013>927|pmid=993918|accessdate=July 31, 2011|doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(76)80597-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Opitz|first=John|coauthors=Jorde|title=Hamartoma Syndromes, Exome Sequencing, and a Protean Puzzle|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=July 27, 2011|pmid=21793737|accessdate=July 31, 2011|doi=10.1056/NEJMe1107384|volume=365|issue=7|pages=661<U+2013>3}}</ref> Dr. [[Michael Cohen (doctor)|Michael Cohen]] described it in 1979,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cohen MM, Hayden PW |title=A newly recognized hamartomatous syndrome |journal=Birth Defects  Orig.

Those most readily diagnosed are also the most severely disfigured.

==Presentation==
Proteus syndrome causes an overgrowth of skin, bones, muscles, fatty tissues, and blood and lymphatic vessels.

Proteus syndrome is a progressive condition wherein children are usually born without any obvious deformities. Tumors of skin and bone growths appear as they age. The severity and locations of these various [[asymmetrical]] growths vary greatly but typically the skull, one or more limbs, and soles of the feet will be affected. There is a risk of premature death in affected individuals due to [[deep vein thrombosis]] and [[pulmonary embolism]] caused by the vessel malformations that are associated with this disorder. Because of carrying excess weight and enlarged limbs, arthritis and muscle pain may also be symptoms <U+2014> as is the case for [[Mandy Sellars]], a woman living with a form of Proteus syndrome<ref>{{cite web | last = Neglia | first = Ashley | authorlink = http://www.aolhealth.com/bio/ashley-neglia | title = Living With Proteus syndrome |  publisher = AOL Health | date = May 2009 | url = http://www.aolhealth.com/health/proteus-syndrome | accessdate = June 2009}}</ref> (but see "Notable Cases" below). Further risks may occur due to the mass of extra tissue. 

The disorder itself does not uniformly cause learning impairments: the distribution of intelligence deficits among sufferers of Proteus syndrome appears higher than that of the general population, although this is difficult to determine with statistical significance.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=Joyce|coauthors=Cohen, Biesecker|title=Reassessment of the Proteus syndrome literature: application of diagnostic criteria to published cases|journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics|date=Oct 1, 2004|year=2004|volume=130A|issue=2|pages=111<U+2013>122|pmid=15372514|accessdate=July 31, 2011|doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.30327}}</ref> In addition, the presence of visible deformity may have a negative effect on the social experiences of the sufferer, causing cognitive and social deficits.

Afflicted individuals are at increased risk for developing certain tumors including unilateral ovarian cystadenomas, testicular tumors, meningiomas, and monomorphic adenomas of the parotid gland.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Genetics==
[[File:Proteus Syndrome - NHGRI - NHI.jpg|thumb|Proteus syndrome is an overgrowth disorder caused by a rare genetic mosaicism. A genetic mutation during embryonic development gives rise to overgrowth in a subset of the individual's cells]]
In 2011 researchers determined the cause of Proteus syndrome. In 26 of 29 patients who met strict clinical criteria for the disorder Lindhurst ''et al.'' identified an activating mutation in [[AKT1|AKT1 kinase]] in a mosaic state gene.<ref name=Lindhurst2012>{{cite journal|last=Lindhurst|first=MJ|coauthors=et al.|title=A mosaic activating mutation in AKT1 associated with the Proteus syndrome.|journal=N Engl J Med|date=Aug 18 2011|year=2011|volume=365|issue=7|pages=611<U+2013>9|pmid=21793738|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1104017}}</ref> This mutation in the [[AKT1]] gene was present in all 26 affected patients.

Previous research had suggested the condition linked to [[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]] on [[chromosome 10]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Smith JM, Kirk EP, Theodosopoulos G, ''et al.'' |title=Germline mutation of the tumour suppressor PTEN in Proteus syndrome |journal=J. Med.

==Treatment==
A team of doctors in Australia have trial tested the drug [[Sirolimus|Rapamycin]] in the treatment of a patient said to have Proteus syndrome and have found it to be an effective remedy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Marsh|first=Deborah|coauthors=Trahair, Martin, Chee, Walker, Kirk, Baxter, Marshall|title=Rapamycin treatment for a child with germline PTEN mutation|journal=Nature Clinical Practice Oncology|date=April 22, 2008|volume=5|pages=357<U+2013>361|pmid=18431376|doi=10.1038/ncponc1112|issue=6}}</ref> However, the diagnosis of Proteus syndrome in this patient has been questioned by others.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=M. Michael|coauthors=Turner, Biesecker|title=Proteus Syndrome: Misdiagnosis with PTEN Mutations|journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics|date=July 14, 2003|month=November|volume=122A|issue=4|pages=323<U+2013>324|pmid=14518070|doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.20474}}</ref>

==Classification==
Many sources classify Proteus syndrome to be a type of [[nevus]] syndrome. The lesions appear to be distributed in a mosaic manner.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Biesecker L, Happle R, Mulliken J, Weksberg R, Graham J, Viljoen D, Cohen M | title=Proteus syndrome: differential diagnosis, and patient evaluation | journal=Am J Med Genet | volume=84 | issue=5 | pages=389<U+2013>95 | year=1999 | pmid=10360391 | doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-8628(19990611)84:5<389::AID-AJMG1>3.0.CO;2-O}}</ref> It has been confirmed that the disorder is an example of genetic [[mosaicism]].<ref name=Lindhurst2011>Lindhurst MJ, Sapp JC, Teer JK, Johnston JJ, Finn EM, Peters K, Turner J, Cannons JL, Bick D, Blakemore L, Blumhorst C, Brockmann K, Calder P, Cherman N, Deardorff MA, Everman DB, Golas G, Greenstein RM, Kato BM, Keppler-Noreuil KM, Kuznetsov SA, Miyamoto RT, Newman K, Ng D, O'Brien K, Rothenberg S, Schwartzentruber DJ, Singhal V, Tirabosco R, Upton J, Wientroub S, Zackai EH, Hoag K, Whitewood-Neal T, Robey PG, Schwartzberg PL, Darling TN, Tosi LL, Mullikin JC, Biesecker LG (2011) A Mosaic Activating Mutation in AKT1 Associated with the Proteus Syndrome.

==Notable cases==
In 1971, Ashley Montagu suggested in his book ''The Elephant Man: A Study in Human Dignity'' that [[Joseph Merrick]] suffered [[Neurofibromatosis type 1]], and this has continued to be reported.  However, careful research has shown that Merrick may have actually suffered from Proteus syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1136/bmj.293.6548.683 | author=Tibbles J, Cohen M | title=The Proteus syndrome: the Elephant Man diagnosed | journal=Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) | volume=293 | issue=6548 | pages=683<U+2013>5 | year=1986 | pmid=3092979 | pmc=1341524}}</ref><ref>[http://www.unboundmedicine.com/medline/ebm/record/11399837/full_citation/The_improbable_%22Elephant_Man%22_ - Spiring P (2001).

[[Mandy Sellars]] has been diagnosed by some doctors as suffering from this condition.<ref name=BBC/> Her legs and feet have grown at a disproportionate rate since birth. However in 2013, Sellars' case was profiled on British television in a special called Shrinking My 17 Stone Legs, in which it was determined that Sellars' condition was not, in fact, Proteus syndrome, but rather a PIK3CA gene mutation.<ref>http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/tvmagazine/4795671/Meet-the-woman-with-a-17st-leg-in-Shrinking-My-17-Stone-Legs-An-Extraordinary-People-Special.html</ref>
