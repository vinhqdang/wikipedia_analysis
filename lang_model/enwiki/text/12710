==Concussions in other sports==
===Association football===
[[Association football]]<U+2014>while not as severe as [[American football]]<U+2014>has also been one of the major sports to have concussions. Even though 50-80% of injuries in football are to the legs, head injuries have been shown to account for between 4 and 22% of football injuries, with a possibility that heading the ball could damage the head, as the ball could travel at 100 km/hour. However, most professional football players reported that they experienced head injuries from colliding with other players and the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/soccer.html |title=Neuroscience for Kids - Soccer |publisher=Faculty.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref> A [[Norway|Norwegian]] study consisting of current and former players of the [[Norway national football team]] found out that 3% of the active and 30% of the former players had persistent symptoms of concussions, and that 35% of the active and 32% of that former players had abnormal [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG).<ref>{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1439395?dopt=Abstract |title=Head and neck injuries in soccer.

===American football===
{{main|Concussions in American football}}
American football has been known to have the most concussions out of any other sport in the United States, with over 250,000 injuries reported annually in football players, with 20% of high-school football players experiencing a concussion every year.<ref>{{cite web|author=SMH |url=http://www.hughston.com/hha/a_12_2_3.htm |title=Sport-Related Concussion |publisher=Hughston.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref> In 2000, researchers from the Sports Medicine Research Laboratory at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] analyzed 17,549 players from 242 different school. Research eventually revealed that 888 (5.1%) of the players analyzed have at least one concussion a season, and 131 (14.7%) of them have had another concussion the year later. [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] and high-school players have a higher tendecy to sustain a concussion than [[Division II (NCAA)|Division II]] and [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/concuss.html |title=Neuroscience for Kids - Football Concussions |publisher=Faculty.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref> In {{NFL Year|2001}}, the [[National Football League Players Association]] partnered with the UNC to determine whether professional football players suffer any health effects after any injuries, with the findings being criticized by the NFL for being unreliable due to being based on self-reporting by the players.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hadhazy |first=Adam |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=football-concussions-felt-long-after-retirement |title=Concussions Exact Toll on Football Players Long After They Retire |publisher=Scientific American |date=2008-09-02 |accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref>

===Auto racing===
The [[Death of Dale Earnhardt|death]] of [[Dale Earnhardt]], along with [[Kenny Irwin]], [[Adam Petty]] and [[Tony Roper]] led to NASCAR creating various protocols to aid in driver safety, such as the introduction of the [[Car of Tomorrow]]. Drivers were eventually instructed to wear head and neck restraints, and SAFER barriers have been installed on racetrack walls, with foam-padded supports on each side of the helmet that would allow a driver's head to move in the event of a crash. Despite this, 29 concussions have been identified since [[2004 in NASCAR|2004]], and 11 of them have happened since [[2007 in NASCAR|2007]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/racing/news/20120221/nascar-concussions/ |title=NASCAR drivers have concussion concerns - Racing - SI.com |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref>

===Ice hockey===
[[Ice hockey]] has also been known to have concussions inflict various players.

For the [[2010<U+2013>11 NHL season]], the NHL prohibited blindside hits to the head, but did not ban hits to the face. The conference also urged the NHL and its minor entities to join the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]], the [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship|NCAA]] and the [[Ontario Hockey League]] in banning any contact to the head.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/21/sports/hockey/21concussions.html</ref>

==Female sports==
{{main|Concussions in women's sport}}
Various reports have stated that [[women's sports|female athletes]] sustain more concussions than their male counterparts. A December 2008 report states that 29,167 female high school soccer players suffered from concussions in 2005, compared to 20,929 male players. In high school basketball, 12,923 girls suffered from concussions while only 3,823 boys did. Girls also sustained more concussions in softball, compared to boys in baseball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=75789 |title=High school headaches: Girls' concussions outnumber boys' in most sports |publisher=News.medill.northwestern.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref> Female athletes also had longer recovery times than males, and also had lower scores on visual memory tests. One of the possibles reasons that are suggested by various researchers as to why girls have longer recovery times include the possibility that the greater rate of blood flow in the brain for females might have affected the recovery times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/brain/news/20120511/concussions-girls-have-longer-recovery-time |title=Concussions: Girls Have Longer Recovery Time |publisher=Webmd.com |date=2012-05-11 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref>

Women's ice hockey was reported as one of the most dangerous sports in the NCAA, as the concussion rate is 2.72 per 1,000 player hours. Men's ice hockey's concussion rates are 1.25 lower with the same amount of hours. [[College football]] also has lower concussion rates than women's hockey, with a rate of 2.34 per 1,000.<ref>{{cite web|last=Klein |first=Jeff Z. |url=http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/19/at-the-mayo-clinic-womens-hockey-a-most-dangerous-game/ |title=Women's Hockey, a Most Dangerous Game - NYTimes.com |publisher=Slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2010-10-19 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref>

==Prevention efforts==
There have been several attempts at preventing concussions, such as the establishment of the [http://www.dsgpace.org/ PACE (Protecting Athletes Through Concussion Education) Program], which works with the imPACT system, which is currently used by every NFL and some NHL teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2012/06/26/drew-brees-teams-up-against-concussions-in-school-sports/ |title=Drew Brees Teams Up Against Concussions in School Sports - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2012-06-26 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref> In 2008, the [[Arena Football League]] tested a device created by [[Schutt Sports]] called the "Shockometer", which is a triangular device attached to the back of [[football helmet]]s that has a light on the device that turns red when a concussion occurs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nflplayers.com/Articles/Public-News/AFL-Test-Drives-Schutt%e2%80%99s-Shockometer/ |title=AFL-Test-Drives-Schutt<U+2019>S-Shockometer / News |publisher=NFLPlayers.com |date=2008-05-22 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref> [[Riddell]] has also created the Head Impact Telemetry System (HITS) and Sideline Response System (SRS) to record the frequency and severity of player hits during practices and games. On every helmet with the system, MX Encoders are implemented, which can automatically record every hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riddell.com/innovation/hits-technology/ |title=HITS<U+2122> Technology |publisher=Riddell |date= |accessdate=2012-06-26}}</ref> Eight NFL teams had originally planned to use the system in the {{NFL Year|2010}} season, but the [[National Football League Players Association|NFL Players Association]] ultimately blocked its use.<ref name=HITS>{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/06/24/failure-to-use-hit-system-exposes-league-to-future-concussion-liability/ |title=Failure to use HIT system exposes league to future concussion liability &#124; ProFootballTalk |publisher=Profootballtalk.nbcsports.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-26}}</ref>
