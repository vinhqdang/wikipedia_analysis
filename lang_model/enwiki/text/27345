'''Lubbock High School''' (formerly known as '''Tom S. Lubbock High School''' and colloquially known as '''LHS''') is a [[University Interscholastic League#Groupings|5A]] [[high school]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], [[Texas]] ([[United States|USA]]).  Part of the [[Lubbock Independent School District]], the school is known for its academic program and for the fact that it has produced a number of talented musicians and [[singer|vocalists]] over the years (including [[Buddy Holly]] and [[The Crickets]], [[Natalie Maines]], and [[Mac Davis]]).

The school was founded in 1891.  It was the first high school in [[Lubbock County, Texas|Lubbock County]].  Lubbock High's colors are black and gold and its mascot is the Westerner.  The school primarily serves students from the central and eastern parts of Lubbock, but the school's LEAP program serves students from all over the city.

== History ==
[[Image:Lubbock High School.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Main entrance]]
The school was founded in 1891 as a one room school (an additional two rooms were added in 1898).  It was named after [[Thomas Saltus Lubbock]], a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Colonel]] and [[Texas Rangers (law enforcement)|Texas Ranger]].  The original announcement of the school's opening read:  "Schooling for all who could reach it by pony, wagon, buggy or on foot."  The first (and only) teacher at this point was Miss Minnie Tubbs.<ref name="historyoftheschool">[http://www.lubbockhigh.com/pages/history.asp History of the School and LISD].  Retrieved [[2 May]] [[2006]].</ref>  In March 1909, a fire set by students destroyed the building.  After this, the school relocated to a brick building with two stories and a basement at the location of the current City Hall in Lubbock.<ref name="historyoftheschool">History of the School and LISD</ref>

In the fall of 1929, plans began for the construction of a new building for LHS.  Construction began in 1930, and the building was completed in 1931.  The school opened in its new location for the fall semester of 1931.  This is the current Lubbock High School building.  Due to its distinctive architecture, the school is included in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name="lubbockschools">[http://lubbockschools.com/data/lhlubbock.shtml Lubbock High School].

In 2003, the school made national news because its [[Gay-Straight Alliance]] (GSA) was denied official status as a student organization.  [[Lambda Legal]] represented the GSA on behalf of students Mirah Curzer and Yvonne Caudillo in its case against the Lubbock Independent School District, which it ultimately lost.<ref>Lambda Legal.

== Academics ==

In 1979, due to low enrollment as a result of new school district boundaries, there was discussion of closing LHS.  In order to solve this problem and to comply with an ongoing desegragation plan ordered by the US Department of Justice, LEAP (Lubbock Exemplary Academic Program) was developed.  This college preparatory program offers advanced classes in mathematics, science, English, and history.  In its initial design, the LEAP plan included several incentives to attract students from outside the school's geographic district.  These included unique classes not offered at that time in other Lubbock high schools, including Russian, Portuguese, Mandarin Chinese, Western Cultures, Marine Biology, and Calculus, among others.  Additionally, the school offered trips to relevant locations in conjunction with specific classes.  For example, students in the Western Cultures class spent 15 days in western Europe at the close of the school year.  Due to pressure from parents with students in other high schools in the district, some of these incentives were phased out by the school board in the 1983-1984 academic year.<ref name="historyoftheschool">History of the School and LISD</ref>

1983 saw the addition of the "Friday Enrichment Schedule," wherein students attended academic classes Monday through Thursday (for longer hours than other high schools in Lubbock) and attended either "enriching classes" (e.g. "Reading for Pleasure," "French Club," etc.) or review classes from 8am until noon on Fridays. Along with the "Friday Enrichment Schedule," a program was instituted in 1983 that allowed junior or senior students to take courses at [[Texas Tech University]] or [[South Plains College]] for dual credit.<ref name="lubbockschools">Lubbock High School</ref><ref name="historyoftheschool">History of the School and LISD</ref>

In 1996, Lubbock High was named as a [[Blue Ribbon Schools Program|Blue Ribbon]] school.<ref>[http://www.ed.gov/PressReleases/02-1996/blues.html Riley Names 266 Blue Ribbon Schools].  [[8 February]] [[1996]].  Retrieved [[2 May]] [[2006]].</ref><ref name="schoolofchoice">[http://www.lubbockisd.org/Magnet/Lubbock2.htm LISD Schools of Choice: Lubbock HS].  [[1 December]] [[2005]].  Retrieved [[2 May]] [[2006]].</ref><ref name="historyoftheschool">History of the School and LISD</ref>

In the 2000-2001 school year, Lubbock High began to offer the [[International Baccalaureate]] program, a prestigious academic curriculum.<ref name="schoolofchoice">LISD Schools of Choice: Lubbock HS</ref><ref name="historyoftheschool">History of the School and LISD</ref>  The Class of 2002 was the first to be able to graduate with an IB diploma, and the program has been growing since then. As of the 2005-2006 school year the IB program at Lubbock High School had 45 registered candidates.

== Extracurricular activities ==
=== Academic Decathlon ===
In 2002, the Lubbock High [[United States Academic Decathlon|Academic Decathlon]] team made national news when its victory over [[J. Frank Dobie High School]] in the state championship competition was disputed in court.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1141334 "Texas Academic Decathlon"].  ''[[All Things Considered]]''. [[8 April]] [[2002]].  Retrieved [[2 May]] [[2006]].</ref> The debate arose when there were questions about the scoring methods used in some of the competition's events. Both Dobie and LHS prepared for national competition in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] as the lawsuit developed. The Court ruled Lubbock High the rightful victor, and the team did not hear of this news until they were en route to Phoenix. At nationals, Lubbock High went on to place 3rd in the national competition, as well as 1st place among "rookie" schools in the competition. In later years, Lubbock High made history again when an LHS decathlete, Mirah Curzer, became the first competitor to achieve the highest score in the state without competing in the highest division.

=== Athletics ===
Lubbock High competes in many sports.  These include [[American football|football]] (boys), tennis (boys and girls), [[basketball]] (boys and girls), [[baseball]] (boys), softball (girls), [[golf]] (boys and girls), [[soccer]] (boys and girls), [[volleyball]] (girls), [[swimming]] (boys and girls), [[gymnastics]] (boys and girls), and [[Athletics (track and field)|track and field]] (boys and girls).  Boys' teams are called "Westerners," whereas girls' teams are called "Lady Westerners."  In 1922, the football team was named "The Pirates" despite the school's mascot being "The Westerner."  This changed in the 1930s, and the team's name has been "The Westerners" ever since.<ref name="historyoftheschool">History of the School and LISD</ref>  LHS was named "AAAAA Texas State Sportsmanship Champion School" in 1998 by the [[University Interscholastic League]].<ref name="schoolofchoice">LISD Schools of Choice: Lubbock HS</ref><ref name="historyoftheschool">History of the School and LISD</ref> The Lubbock High Boys swim team has won 15 straight district championships and the Lubbock High Girls swim team has won 5 straight district championships.

=== Robotics ===
The Lubbock High team won the "Against All Odds" award at the [[FIRST|US FIRST]] robotics competition in 1997.  This was given due to the fact that they had raised the money to enter and attend the competition (which took place in [[Orlando, Florida]]) themselves, rather than relying on corporate sponsorship like many other competitors did.  Lubbock High has also competed in the West Texas [[BEST Robotics|BEST]] competition since 1996.<ref>BEST Robotics, Inc.

=== Science Bowl ===
A team from Lubbock High won the first ever National [[Science Bowl]] in 1991.  The team again achieved a Science Bowl victory in 1992.<ref>[http://www.scied.science.doe.gov/nsb/pastprize.htm 1991 - 2005 First Place Teams and Prizes].
