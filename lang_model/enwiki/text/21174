'''''Red vs. Blue: The Blood Gulch Chronicles''''', often abbreviated as '''''RvB''''', is a [[machinima]] [[comic science fiction]] video series created by [[Rooster Teeth Productions]] and distributed primarily through the [[Internet]] and [[DVD]]. The series chronicles the story of two opposing teams of soldiers fighting a [[civil war]] in the middle of a desolate box canyon (Blood Gulch), in a [[parody]] of [[first-person shooter]] (FPS) games, military life, and science fiction films. Initially intended to be a short series of six to eight episodes, the project quickly and unexpectedly achieved significant popularity following its Internet premiere on [[April 1]], [[2003]]. Rooster Teeth therefore decided to extend the series; the fifth and final season ended with episode 100, released on [[June 28]], [[2007]].

''Red vs. Blue'' emerged from [[Burnie Burns]]' [[voice-over]]-enhanced gameplay videos of [[Bungie Studios]]' [[First-person shooter|FPS]] [[video game]] ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]''. The series is primarily produced using the [[machinima]] technique of synchronizing video footage from a game to pre-recorded dialogue and other audio. Footage is mostly from the [[multiplayer game|multiplayer mode]]s of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' and its [[sequel]], ''[[Halo 2]]'', on the [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox]] [[video game console]].

Both within the machinima community and among film critics, ''Red vs. Blue'' has been generally well-received. Praised for its originality, the series has won four awards from the [[Academy of Machinima Arts & Sciences]]. It has been credited with bringing new popularity to machinima, helping it to gain more mainstream exposure, and attracting more people to the art form. Graham Leggat, former director of communications for [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]]'s film society, described ''Red vs. Blue'' as "truly as sophisticated as [[Samuel Beckett]]."<ref name="Delaney">Delaney.</ref> While special videos continue to be released online, the first four completed seasons are also available on DVD, with the fifth season to be released in early August, making the series one of the first commercially released and successful machinima products. Rooster Teeth has created videos, some under commission from [[Microsoft]], for special events, and ''Red vs. Blue'' content is advertised to be included with a premium "Legendary" edition of ''[[Halo 3]]''.

==Plot==
''Red vs. Blue'' centers on the Red and Blue Teams, two groups of soldiers engaged in a civil war. Each team occupies a small base in a box canyon known as Blood Gulch. According to {{rvbchar|Simmons}} ([[Gustavo Sorola]]), one of the Red Team soldiers, each team's base exists only in response to the other team's base. Although both teams generally dislike each other and have standing orders to defeat their opponents and [[capture the flag|capture their flag]], neither team's soldiers are usually motivated to fight each other- if they are otherwise, neither are efficient. Teammates have an array of eccentric personalities and often create more problems for each other than for their enemies.  

The main ''Red vs. Blue'' storyline spans five seasons, the most recent beginning publicly on [[October 2]], [[2006]].<ref name="RvBEp78Announce">Burns, 2006, Season 5 Public.</ref> Rooster Teeth periodically releases self-referential [[public service announcement]]s (PSAs) and holiday-themed videos, which are generally unrelated to the main storyline. In these videos, the members of both teams claim to be actors on the ''Red vs. Blue'' series itself, but maintain their ''Blood Gulch Chronicles'' personalities. On [[June 16]], [[2006]], Burns announced a five-part mini-series, ''[[Red vs. Blue: Out of Mind]]'', which chronicles the adventures of the [[mercenary]] {{rvbchar|Tex}} ([[Kathleen Zuelch]]) after her disappearance in {{rvbep|season 4}}. The mini-series premiered exclusively on the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]],<ref name="BurnsOutOfSight">Burns, "Out of Sight."</ref> but Rooster Teeth later made it available on their official site.<ref name="BurnsOutOfMindonRvB">Burns, "Out of Mind on RvB."</ref>

Although the background of ''Red vs. Blue'' is primarily taken from ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' and ''Halo 2'', its creators consciously limit connections to Bungie's [[Halo universe|''Halo'' fictional universe]]. A special video made for [[E3]] 2003 portrays [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]], the protagonist of the [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' series]], as a larger-than-life member of the army, and the ''Red vs. Blue'' [[trailer (film)|trailer]] and first episode establish that the series is set between the events of the two games. Beyond these references, however, the series follows an independent storyline, which, according to Burns, is intended to make it accessible to those unfamiliar with the games. For example, even though the season 4 and {{rvbep|season 5}} casts include characters from the alien [[Covenant Elite]] race, Rooster Teeth never portrays those characters in their original ''Halo'' context.<ref name="Smith">Smith.</ref>.

The indifference in Blood Gulch is disrupted by the introduction of new characters. {{rvbchar|Donut}} ([[Dan Godwin]]) joins the {{rvbchar|Red Team}}; on his first day, he captures the Blue flag when his new teammates, {{rvbchar|Grif}} ([[Geoff Ramsey]]) and {{rvbchar|Simmons}} ([[Gustavo Sorola]]) send him on a [[snipe hunt|fool's errand]] during the absence of the team leader, {{rvbchar|Sarge}} ([[Matt Hullum]]). Meanwhile, a rookie named {{rvbchar|Caboose}} ([[Joel Heyman]]) and a battle tank named {{rvbchar|Sheila}} ([[Yomary Cruz]]) join the {{rvbchar|Blue Team}} and accidentally kill the group's self-appointed leader, {{rvbchar|Church}} ([[Burnie Burns]]). At the request of {{rvbchar|Tucker}} ([[Jason Salda<U+00F1>a]]) and Caboose, Blue Command hires a mercenary named Tex to help. Church briefly returns as a ghost to warn his teammates about Tex, who soon arrives but is captured after returning the flag. Church again appears to the Blues to explain that Tex is actually his former girlfriend, whose mind is partially controlled by a psychotic [[artificial intelligence]] (AI). He organizes a rescue mission and succeeds, but decides to keep Tex stationed in Blood Gulch long enough for him to remove the AI. Church possesses the Red Team's [[robot]], {{rvbchar|Lopez}} (Burnie Burns), to warn them of Tex's next attack, but is unable to stop Donut from mortally wounding her with a grenade. Church runs to her side, stealing Lopez's body in the process. Just before she dies, she informs Church that her AI is gone. Meanwhile, Caboose insists that his real name is O'Malley.<ref name="RvBS1">Burns, ''et al.'', 2003.</ref>

Three months after Tex's death, {{rvbchar|Doc|DuFresne}} (Matt Hullum), a [[medic]] soon nicknamed "Doc," arrives in the canyon on loan to both armies due to a lack of resources, but is soon rejected by both teams due to his annoying personality. Meanwhile, Church eventually loses control of his stolen robot body. Tex returns as a ghost and informs the Blues that her evil, [[narcissistic personality disorder|megalomaniacal]] AI, {{rvbchar|O'Malley}} (various),<ref>O'Malley is voiced by the actor responsible for whichever character he is possessing at the time.</ref> had transferred itself to Caboose just before her death. Church and Tex enter Caboose's mind and force out O'Malley, but the AI takes control of Doc. Later, the Blues capture Donut, and Sarge is forced to build new robot bodies for Church and Tex in exchange for his return. Meanwhile, Sheila and Lopez form their own robot army and attend the exchange to conquer the Blues. During the ensuing standoff, Tucker discovers that both teams are apparently secretly controlled by the same Command; they have a common contact named {{rvbchar|Vic}} (Burnie Burns). O'Malley suddenly appears, kidnaps Lopez, and escapes with him through a teleporter. The Red and Blue Teams call a [[armistice|truce]] and team up to pursue O'Malley.<ref name="RvBS1">Burns, ''et al.'', 2004.</ref> However, the teleporter malfunctions,<ref name="RvBS3Ep51">Burms, ''et al.'' 2005, episode 51.</ref> and the teams become scattered across various locations outside Blood Gulch.<ref name="RvBS2">Burns, ''et al.'', 2004.</ref>

{{main|Red vs. Blue (season 3)}}
:''[[October 12]], [[2004]] <U+2013> [[May 18]], [[2005]]: episodes 39<U+2013>57''
On behalf of Vic, O'Malley hires a mercenary, {{rvbchar|Wyoming}} (Matt Hullum), to kill Tucker and thus keep the secrecy of the apparent Command conspiracy. The Red and Blue Teams regroup on Sidewinder and confront O'Malley, but a bomb built into Church's robot body propels everyone, except Church, into the future (represented by ''Halo 2''); Church is thrown into the past (represented by the ''[[Marathon Trilogy]]''). In the future, the Reds and Blues battle O'Malley at his new fortress but become trapped inside with an active time bomb, who is later revealed to be a sentient, foul-mouthed entity named {{rvbchar|Andy}} (Nathan Zellner). In the past, Church waits one thousand years until {{rvbchar|Gary}}, a computer he met, can teleport him back to Blood Gulch. He arrives before the events of the first episode and attempts to prevent the problems of seasons 1 and 2, but realizes that his own actions cause these issues, and eventually travels to Sidewinder to be blown into the future with everyone else. He arrives just in time to ask Gary, who remains in the fortress, to stop Andy's detonation. O'Malley soon lays siege to his captured fortress with an army of robots. However, an unknown being destroys the army and then confronts O'Malley himself. Unknown to the Blues, the Reds leave mid-battle and arrive back at Blood Gulch. The season ends as a creature creeps up on an unsuspecting Church.<ref name="RvBS3">Burns, ''et al.'', 2005.</ref>

{{main|Red vs. Blue (season 4)}}
:''[[August 29]], [[2005]] <U+2013> [[April 1]], [[2006]]: episodes 58<U+2013>77''
As the Red Team re-explores Blood Gulch, Simmons is briefly exiled from the Red team, and paints himself Blue in anger. Back at the fortress, the Blue Team learns through Andy's translating that the new {{rvbchar|Alien}} (Nathan Zellner) is on a sacred quest to become ruler of his people and has come to retrieve The Great Weapon, an energy sword. However, Tucker has found the weapon first, and now only he can use it. The Alien forces Tucker, Andy, and Caboose to partake of his quest; Tex trails and later joins them. Wyoming re-appears, however, and kills the Alien, before fleeing with Tex in pursuit. Meanwhile, Church returns to Blood Gulch and encounters the blue Simmons, whom he pretends not to recognize, and accidentally contacts {{rvbchar|Vic Jr.}} (Burnie Burns), a distant descendant of Vic who informs Church about past events. Simmons returns to the Red Base to relay Vic Jr.'s information, while the quest team returns to Blood Gulch. Tucker becomes ill, and Church calls Doc, whom O'Malley still controls, for help. After Doc [[diagnosis|diagnoses]] Tucker with [[male pregnancy]], Andy reveals that the Alien had impregnated Tucker through parasites, and the latter gives birth off-screen. O'Malley leaves Doc after Sarge contacts Command for reinforcements, and a ship immediately crashes into the gulch, on top of Donut.<ref name="RvBS4">Burns, ''et al.'', 2006.</ref>

===''Out of Mind''===
{{main|Red vs. Blue: Out of Mind}}
:''[[June 16]], [[2006]] <U+2013> [[September 4]], [[2006]]: Parts 1-5''
Set after the events of {{rvbep|71}}, the five-part ''Out of Mind'' mini-series chronicles Tex's pursuit of Wyoming as she tracks him to O'Malley's base. The story then [[flashback|flashes back]] to detail the implantation of the AI {{rvbchar|O'Malley|Omega}} (who would become O'Malley) into Tex. After the flashback, Tex enlists another soldier from the same implantation process, {{rvbchar|York}}, to help infiltrate the base. As they do so, they become caught in a fight with Wyoming and two henchmen. York is fatally wounded, but Tex, with the aid of Delta, York's AI, corners Wyoming. The mini-series ends as Tex attacks Wyoming so that she can discover O'Malley's current host.<ref name="RvBS5">Burns, ''et al.'', 2007.</ref>

Donut has fallen into an underground cave from the force of the craft's weight, unknown to the Reds. Grif's sibling, {{rvbchar|Sister}} (Rebecca Frasier), emerges from the ship, though it is revealed to Grif and Simmons she is meant to be on the Blue Team after the death of {{rvbchar|Captain Flowers|Captain Butch Flowers}}, who was accidentally killed by the time-traveling Church. Grif gives Sister up, reasoning that she wouldn't be safe if Sarge learned her true alliance. The Reds soon discover the underground cavern and find Donut alive; and find an underground surveillance computer spying on Blood Gulch. Meanwhile, the Blues decide to move Sheila's AI to the crashed ship following malfunction in the tank, and deal with Tucker's birth of the alien child, {{rvbchar|Junior}} (Jason Salda<U+00F1>a). Tex returns, and it is revealed that Gary is Wyoming's AI, as O'Malley was to Tex, and built Wyoming a teleporter to escape Tex's questioning in ''Out of Mind''. Vic contacts the Blues, urging them to attack Red Base via the caves; instead, they split up.

Caboose tends to Sheila as Doc, Junior, and Sister go through the caves alone, and find Lopez, who had returned to the Gulch with O'Malley. The group is then confronted by O'Malley's new host, a revived Captain Flowers. Church, Tucker and Tex meanwhile attack the Red Base head on, and are ambushed by Wyoming and Gary, the latter of whom now inhabits the Blue tank. Wyoming uses his secret ability to rewind segments of time in order to defeat the Blues as efficiently as possible, but Tucker, who is somehow aware of the time anomalies because of the sword, stabs and kills him before he can rewind time again. It is revealed that Junior is the supposed ruler of the aliens from the sacred quest of season 4, and that the villains intend to exploit the Alien race through him. Tex, deciding the Blues could use this power to win the war, broadcasts on an open channel to be infected by O'Malley. Church attempts to stop her by having everyone open their radio channels to confuse the AI, and orders Sarge to disable the ship as a precaution. After going through multiple hosts, O'Malley eventually finds Tex, who enters the ship with Lopez and Junior. However, the Reds have placed Andy on the ship instead of disabling it, and an explosion is seen. The survivors return to their bases and echo dialogue from the first episodes.<ref>A total of [[Red vs. Blue (season 5)#Official Ending - Alarm|six alternate endings]] were released on the Season 5 DVD, with two of them having been available on the website since the release of {{rvbep|100|episode 100}}</ref><ref name="RvBS5" />

{{main|List of characters in Red vs. Blue}}
''Red vs. Blue'' features characters whose personalities are skewed in different ways and to varying degrees. Character interaction and dialogue, rather than action, drive much of the story.<ref name="Jandoc">Jandoc.</ref>  The series has revolved around eight main characters, four on each team. Several other characters, both team-affiliated and unaffiliated, human and non-human, have played significant roles at various points in the story.

===Main characters===
Sarge is the [[Staff Sergeant|staff sergeant]]<ref name="S3DVDProfilesSarge">Burns, ''et al.'' 2005, Character profiles, Sarge.</ref> and leader of the Blood Gulch Red Team. A [[military man]] with a [[Southern American English|Southern United States accent]], he is the only Blood Gulch soldier on either team consistently serious about the Red versus Blue civil war. His [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]] battle plans often entail unnecessary [[Casualty (person)|casualties]] of his own men, especially Grif. Dexter Grif is habitually lazy, irresponsible, and uninsightful. These characteristics earn him the disrespect and ridicule of both Sarge and Dick Simmons, Sarge's [[sycophant]]ic, [[insecurity|insecure]], [[right-hand man]]. Despite this, Simmons and Grif are often seen together, either chatting or bickering.  Franklin Delano Donut is the eager rookie who joins the team in {{rvbep|3}}. He tends to annoy his teammates with his na<U+00EF>vet<U+00E9>, garrulousness, and cheerfulness and becomes more [[effeminacy|effeminate]] and childish as the series progresses.

Leonard L. Church is the [[cynicism|cynical]] ''[[de facto]]'' leader of the Blue Team. Often shouldering the responsibility of actually solving the various crises that the Blood Gulch teams encounter, he often ends up taking their brunt, leaving him increasingly disillusioned and antisocial. His serious, reasoned approach conflicts with the personalities of Lavernius Tucker and Michael J. Caboose. The former is snide, averse to work and battle, and obsessed with women; the latter, although physically strong, exhibits ever-increasing degrees of stupidity and childishness throughout the series. Tex, Church's former girlfriend, is hired by Blue Command to join the team as a [[mercenary]] in {{rvbep|10}}. Able to eliminate entire teams of soldiers by herself, she is described as "the most lethal soldier in Blood Gulch."<ref name="S3DVDProfilesTex">Burns, ''et al.'' 2005, Character profiles, Tex.</ref>

===Significant supporting characters===
<!-- PLEASE read the Talk page before editing or adding to these summaries. -->

==Background==
''Red vs. Blue'' emerged from [[Burnie Burns]]'s voiceover-enhanced gameplay videos that he created for a website called ''drunkgamers.com'', which was run by [[Geoff Ramsey|Geoff Fink]] (later Geoff Ramsey) and [[Gustavo Sorola]]. Having played ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' extensively, the ''drunkgamers'' crew discussed one day whether the Warthog, an automobile in the game, actually looked more like a cat. This discussion, re-created in {{rvbep|2}}, was "the spark for the whole series."<ref name="S1DVDCommentEp2">Burns, ''et al.'' 2003, Audio Commentary, {{rvbep|2}}.</ref> With the idea that a full story could be developed, Burns created a {{rvbep|trailer|trailer for ''Red vs. Blue''}}, but it was largely ignored, and, for unrelated reasons, ''drunkgamers'' soon closed. Four months later, ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' contacted Ramsey for permission to include a ''drunkgamers'' video in a CD to be distributed with the magazine. Ramsey granted permission, but he and Burns felt that they needed a website to take advantage of the exposure from ''Computer Gaming World''. As a result, they resurrected the ''Red vs. Blue'' project and re-released the trailer to coincide with the ''Computer Gaming World'' issue. The {{rvbep|1|first episode proper}} was released on [[April 1]] [[2003]].<ref>The History of ''Red vs. Blue''; Konow, 2.</ref>

Rooster Teeth was initially unaware of the [[machinima]] movement. Co-producer [[Matt Hullum]] stated in an interview with ''[[GameSpy]]'' in 2004, "When we first started ''Red vs. Blue'' we thought we were completely original. We never imagined that there were other people out there using video games to make movies, much less that it was a new art form with a hard to pronounce name and an official organization."<ref name="Kosak">Kosak.</ref>

The nature of ''Red vs. Blue'' was different from Burns's initial expectation. A partial character introduction released between the original trailer and the first episode featured extensive action and violence and was set to [[Limp Bizkit]]'s song "[[Break Stuff]]." However, as the project developed, the crew realized that it was going to focus more on [[situation comedy]] rather than on the heavy action initially implied.<ref name="S1DVDCommentIntro">Burns, ''et al.'' 2003, Audio Commentary, introduction.</ref> Indeed, although the series parodies video games, Ramsey noted, "We try not to make it too much of an [[in-joke|inside joke]]. And I think we use more bureaucracy and military humor than anything else, which everybody working in an office can identify with."<ref name="Konow4">Konow, 4.</ref> Rooster Teeth noted that ''Red vs. Blue'' has a wide variety of influences,<ref name="Oliver">Oliver.</ref> including ''[[Homestar Runner]]'',<ref name="S1DVDCommentEp16">Burns, ''et al.'' 2003, Audio Commentary, {{rvbep|16}}.</ref> ''[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)|Penny Arcade]]'',<ref name="Smith" /> and possibly ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.<ref name="Konow4" />

Rooster Teeth also initially envisioned the project to be short, but the series grew beyond their expectations. Burns and Ramsey had preconceived a list of jokes for ''Red vs. Blue'' and initially planned the series to last between six and eight episodes. By {{rvbep|8}}, however, they realized that the series had fleshed out more than expected; they had covered only about one third of their original joke list.<ref name="S1DVDComment">Burns, ''et al.'' 2003, Audio Commentary {{rvbep|4|episode 4}}.</ref> Later in {{rvbep|season 1}}, Burns estimated a series of 22 episodes; however, driven by the series' popularity, he realized that there was more potential story than could be covered in that length,<ref name="Waters">Waters.</ref> and was able to conceive an extension of the season 1 plot. On [[April 1]], [[2007]], Burns announced that the series would end at episode 100,<ref name="BurnsThankYou">Burns, "Thank You".</ref> which was released on [[June 28]], [[2007]].

Compare to the scenes above from ''Halo: Combat Evolved''.]]
The writing process for the series has changed over time. Early in season 1, Burns wrote the episode scripts from week to week, with minimal planning in advance;<ref name="Smith"/> major plot events were conceived shortly before they were filmed.<ref name="S1DVDCommentEp8">Burns, ''et al.'' 2003, Audio Commentary, {{rvbep|8}}.</ref> For the second season, Matt Hullum became a main writer.<ref name="S2DVDComment">Burns, ''et al.'' 2004, Audio Commentary.</ref> A rough plot outline is now written before a season begins, although the actual content of an individual episode is still decided on a more short-term basis.<ref name="Konow3">Konow, 3.</ref> Because ''Red vs. Blue'' is loosely based on the ''Halo'' universe, Rooster Teeth encountered some difficulties when trying to synchronize events in the series with the release of ''Halo 2''.<ref name="S3DVDCommentEp39">Burns, ''et al.'', 2005, Audio Commentary, episode 39.</ref>

Aside from a few scenes created with the ''Marathon Trilogy'' and the PC version of ''Halo'', ''Red vs. Blue'' is mostly filmed with interconnected Xbox consoles. As the series title suggests, the videos are largely set in the ''Halo'' map Blood Gulch and its ''Halo 2'' counterpart, Coagulation. However, some episodes have been filmed on other maps, including Sidewinder from ''Halo'' and Zanzibar and Waterworks from ''Halo 2''. One special video used the public Beta of ''[[Halo 3#Public Beta|Halo 3]]'' as a special introduction video. Within a multiplayer game session of any of the games used for filming, the people controlling the [[avatar (virtual reality)|avatars]] "puppet" their characters, moving them around, firing weapons, and performing other actions as dictated by the script, and in synchronization with the episode's dialogue, which is recorded ahead of time.<ref>Burns, ''et al.'' 2003, Audio Commentary; Delaney.</ref>

The "camera" is simply another player, whose first-person perspective is recorded raw to a computer. As the recording occurs within the game, a few different [[software bug|bugs]] and post-production techniques have been exploited in order to achieve desired visual effects. In particular, [[Adobe Premiere Pro]] is used to edit the audio and video together, impose [[letterbox]]ing to hide the camera player's [[HUD (computer gaming)|head-up display]], add the titles and fade-to-black screens, and create some visual effects that cannot be accomplished in-game.<ref>Burns, ''et al.'' 2003, Audio Commentary; Moltenbrey.</ref>

[[Trocadero (band)|Trocadero]] provides the music for ''Red vs. Blue'', which did not feature any originally. According to a journal entry on the official site, Nico Audy-Rowland, Trocadero's bandleader, was introduced to the series after its premiere and enjoyed it enough to submit a song about it. Burns liked the piece and requested more;<ref name="Audy-Rowland">Audy-Rowland.</ref> he stated in the season 1 DVD audio commentary tracks that the music added a "whole new element to the series."<ref name="RvBS1DVDCommentEp10">Burns, ''et al.'' 2003, Audio Commentary, episode 10.</ref> To create other sound effects, Burns used [[Foley artist]]ry, in some cases to replace cinematically awkward counterparts from the game engine.<ref name="RvBS1DVDCommentEp11">Burns, ''et al.'' 2003, Audio Commentary, episode 11.</ref>

==Reception==
''Red vs. Blue'' attracted interest immediately; the first episode had 20,000 downloads within a day.<ref name="Thompson1">Thompson, 1.</ref> Shortly after episode 2, Bungie Studios contacted Rooster Teeth. The crew had feared that any contact from Bungie would be to force an end to the project, but Bungie enjoyed the videos and was supportive;<ref name="Konow2">Konow, 2.</ref> one staff member called the production "kind of brilliant."<ref name="Thompson3">Thompson 3.</ref> A deal was arranged to ensure that the series could continue to use Bungie's game properties legally,<ref name="Delaney" /> without license fees<ref name="Thompson3"/> and without creative guidelines from Microsoft, Bungie's parent company, except for specifically commissioned videos.<ref name="Oliver" /> ''Red vs. Blue'' continued to attract more attention, and, by April 2004, Kevin J. Delaney of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' estimated that weekly viewership was between 650,000 and 1,000,000.<ref name="Delaney" /> In a 2006 interview, [[Strange Company]] founder Hugh Hancock called the series probably "the most successful machinima productions {{sic}}" and estimated that it was generating almost [[United States dollar|US$]]200,000 annually.<ref name="MacGregor">MacGregor.</ref> ''Red vs. Blue'' content is expected to be included with a premium "Legendary" edition of ''[[Halo 3]]''.<ref name="GWN">Halo 3 Details Explosion.</ref>

''Red vs. Blue'' was widely acclaimed within the machinima industry. The first season won awards for Best Picture, Best Independent Machinima Film, and Best Writing at the Academy of Machinima Arts & Sciences' [[2003 Machinima Film Festival]].<ref name="2003Machinima">Machinima Awards 2003 Results.</ref> Two years later, at the [[2005 Machinima Film Festival|2005 festival]], the {{rvbep|season 3|third season}} won an award for Best Independent Machinima and was nominated for five others.<ref name="2005Machinima">2005 Award Nominations & Selections; Mackie Winners Announced!.</ref> At the 2006 Machinima Festival, the series was nominated for awards in voice acting and writing, but won neither.<ref name="2006machinima">2006 Machinima Film Festival: WINNERS & Nominees.</ref>

Among film critics, the response was generally positive. Darren Waters of ''BBC News Online'' called ''Red vs. Blue'' "riotously funny" and "reminiscent of the anarchic energy of ''[[South Park]]''."<ref name="Waters"/> Reviewing the three season DVDs for ''Cinema Strikes Back'', Charlie Prince wrote, "''Red vs. Blue'' is hysterical in large part because all the characters are morons, and so the seemingly intense conflict with the opposing base doesn't exactly work the way you'd think it would."<ref name="Prince">Prince.</ref> Leggat described the series as "[p]art locker-room humor, part Beckett-like [[absurdism|absurdist]] [[tragicomedy]], part wicked vivisection of game culture and sci-fi action films and games."<ref name="Leggat">Leggat.</ref> Ed Halter of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' dismissed the humor as shallow and described the first season as "''[[Clerks.|Clerks]]''-meets-''[[Star Wars]]''."<ref name="Halter">Halter.</ref> Leggat defended the humor, arguing, "The literary analog is absurdist drama."<ref name="Delaney"/>

Another common criticism of ''Red vs. Blue'' was that its season 3 plot was too far-fetched and out-of-character. Charlie Prince wrote, "By the third season, however, the ''Red vs. Blue'' idea seems to be running out of steam.<U+2026> It's not funny so much as just odd."<ref name="Prince"/> Writing for the ''Honolulu Star-Bulletin'', Wilma Jandoc agreed that the first part of "season 3<U+2026> throws the teams into a ridiculous situation and has limited member interactions, leading to a lack of witty dialogue."<ref name="Jandoc"/> In an ''[[about.com]]'' review of the season 4 DVD, writer Eric Qualls noted that season 3 was "a little too long, and too complicated, and the jokes were a bit too far apart."<ref name="Qualls">Qualls.</ref> Nevertheless, both Prince and Jandoc expressed optimism that the series would improve from this low point, and Qualls stated that the fourth season had "returned to the series' roots" as "some of the funniest stuff you<U+2019>ll ever see."<ref name="Qualls"/>

Rooster Teeth Productions has created special ''Red vs. Blue'' videos for various events. For example, Microsoft has commissioned ''Red vs. Blue'' videos for Xbox demo kiosks found in game stores and for a developer conference.<ref>Red vs. Blue : The Interview Strikes Back; Delaney.</ref> [[Barenaked Ladies]] has also commissioned videos for their concerts.<ref name="Delaney"/> Other videos have been specifically created for gaming magazines, including ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' and ''[[Computer Gaming World]]''; gaming conventions, including [[E3]] and the [[Penny Arcade Expo]]; and the [[Sundance Film Festival]].

''Red vs. Blue'' has also received praise from soldiers stationed in the [[Middle East]]. An August 2005 blog entry by Kimi Matsuzaki of [[1UP.com]] displays photographs of soldiers holding various weapons, as well as copies of the first and second season ''Red vs. Blue'' DVDs.<ref name="Matsuzaki">Matsuzaki.</ref> Geoff Ramsey later stated in an interview, "We get a lot of merchandise and DVDs out to [[Iraq]] and get a lot of great e-mails back."<ref name="Konow4"/>

The notability and impact of ''Red vs. Blue'' extends to video games outside the ''Halo'' series. The developers of the [[Xbox 360]] video game ''[[Gears of War]]'' made a reference to a ''Red vs. Blue'' gag through an in-game achievement called, "Is it a spider?"; the award is earned for tagging opponents with grenades.<ref name="Hsu">Hsu, 106.</ref>
===Impact on machinima===
''Red vs. Blue'' is widely credited with attracting public attention to machinima. Although examples had existed since the 1990s, Clive Thompson credited ''Red vs. Blue'' as "the first to break out of the underground."<ref name="Thompson2">Thompson, 2.</ref> Tavares, Gil, and Roque called it machinima's "first big success,"<ref name="TavaresGilRoque">Tavares, Gil, & Roque, 4.</ref> and [[Paul Marino]] noted that "the series proved so popular that it not only transcended the typical gamer, it also claimed fans outside the gaming world."<ref name="Marino">Marino, 19.</ref> In 2005, Thompson noted that "Microsoft has been so strangely solicitous that when it was developing the sequel to Halo last year, the designers actually inserted a special command <U+2014> a joystick button that makes a soldier lower his weapon <U+2014> designed solely to make it easier for Rooster Teeth to do dialogue."<ref name="Thompson3"/> The series has inspired other machinima productions, including ''[[The Codex]].''<ref name="Whitley">Whitley.</ref>

In the machinima industry, the series has been mentioned as the most successful example of the trend toward [[serial]] distribution. According to [[Hugh Hancock]], this format allows for gradual improvement as a result of viewer feedback, and gives viewers a reason to return for future videos. In fact, Hancock argues that this model was necessary for ''Red vs. Blue''{{'}}s success: "Sunday night is Red vs. Blue night, just as (in the UK) Thursday used to be Buffy. Had RvB released their films as single downloads of an hour and a half, they'd have had nowhere near the success they currently enjoy."<ref name="Hancock">Hancock.</ref>

Videos are typically available in [[QuickTime]] (QT) and [[Windows Media Video]] (WMV) formats. All released episodes of the latest season are freely available from the official site. A few episodes from the previous seasons are available from a rolling archive; each week, the videos are rotated to the next set. This setup is intended to help to control bandwidth costs;<ref name="RvBVideoFAQ">Video FAQ; ''Red vs Blue'' FAQ.</ref> as of September 2005, the official Rooster Teeth website was serving 400 [[terabyte]]s of data monthly.<ref name="Totilo">Totilo.</ref> However, nearly all freely released episodes of ''Red vs. Blue'' are also available from websites such as [[Machinima.com]], [[Archive.org]], [[FilePlanet]], and [[Google Video]].  Out of Mind is available to download free from the [[Xbox 360]] on the Marketplace.

Members of the official website can gain [[sponsor]] status for a fee of US$10 every six months. Sponsors can access videos a few days before the general public release, download higher-resolution versions of the episodes, and access special content released only to sponsors. For example, during [[Red vs. Blue (season 5)|season 5]], Rooster Teeth began to release directors' commentary to sponsors for download. Additionally, while the public archive is limited to rotating sets of videos, sponsors can access content from previous seasons at any time.<ref name="RvBSponsor">Sponsorship FAQ.</ref>

Episodes are released in different [[image resolution|resolutions]]; higher resolutions are reserved for sponsors. Beginning with the ''Red vs. Blue: Out of Mind'' mini-series, Rooster Teeth began to film and edit video in [[720p]] [[high-definition video|high-definition]],<ref name="Sorola">Sorola, Out of Mind.</ref> and to release episodes in [[widescreen]] format, instead of hiding the game HUD through the letterboxing seen in [[full screen|full-screen]] releases.

Although it is distributed serially over the Internet, ''Red vs. Blue'' is also one of the first commercially released products made using machinima, as opposed to a product merely containing machinima. DVDs of the four completed seasons are sold through Rooster Teeth's official website, as well as at most [[EB Games]], [[GameStop]] and [[Hot Topic]] stores in the United States.<ref name="RTBuy">Where To Buy Rooster Teeth Products.</ref> Each season is released on DVD within two months of that season's final episode. For the DVDs, the episodes of the main storyline are edited together to play continuously as a full-length film. Because the episodes as individually released often contain dialogue that continues into or past the fade to black at the end of the video, Rooster Teeth either removes that dialogue entirely or films extra footage to replace the original fade to black.<ref name="RvBS1DVDCommentEp18">Burns, ''et al.'' 2003, Audio Commentary, {{rvbep|18}}.</ref>
		 
A third version of the season is further edited for time for showing at the Lincoln Center and at other film festivals. In a 2005 interview, Burns noted that the first season, normally 75 minutes in length, was cut to 55 minutes for these venues, with an entire episode omitted.<ref name="Marks">Marks.</ref> Burns also noted in a website news post that the 135-minute season 3 DVD version had to be shortened to "a watchable-in-a-theater runtime of 100 minutes."<ref name="135to100">Burns, It's Official.</ref>

With the public release of episode 87 on [[January 8]], [[2007]], [[Matt Hullum]] announced that videos would be viewable in [[Macromedia Flash]] format. He stated that the change allowed Rooster Teeth to release public videos in a higher resolution "while keeping the file size low," and that the entire video archive would be updated. Code to embed the Flash video on other websites was also distributed.<ref name="Hullum">Hullum 2007.</ref> In a site journal entry, Burns clarified that downloadable versions would continue to be released, but after their Flash counterparts.

The first season as well as a re-shot HD version of  the second season has also been released on the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]] for a price of 80 [[Microsoft Points]] each.<ref name="Season1Marketplace">Surette, "Red vs. Blue yuks it up on XBL."</ref>
