'''Wade Anthony Boggs''' (born June 15, 1958) is a former [[third baseman]] in [[Major League Baseball]], primarily with the [[Boston Red Sox]]. His hitting in the 1980s and 1990s made him a perennial contender for [[American League]] batting titles, in much the same way as his [[National League]] contemporary [[Tony Gwynn]]. Boggs was elected to the Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2004 and the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005|2005]]. With 12 straight [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] appearances, Boggs is third only to [[Brooks Robinson]] and [[George Brett (baseball)|George Brett]] in number of consecutive appearances as a third baseman. His finest season was [[1987 Major League Baseball season|1987]], when he set career highs in [[home run]]s (24), [[run batted in|RBI]] (89), and [[slugging percentage]] (.588). He also batted .363 and had a .461 [[on-base percentage]] that year, leading the league in both statistics. In 1999, he ranked number 95 on the ''[[Sporting News]]'' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was a nominee for the [[Major League Baseball]] All-Century Team.

He currently resides in the [[Tampa, Florida]] neighborhood of [[Tampa Palms, Tampa, Florida|Tampa Palms]].

==Minor league career==
Boggs played in the [[longest professional baseball game|longest game in professional baseball history]] as a member of the [[Pawtucket Red Sox]] in 1981 against [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] and the [[Rochester Red Wings]].

==Major league career==
===Boston Red Sox===
A left-handed hitter, Boggs won five batting titles starting in {{by|1983}}. He also batted .349 in his rookie year which would have won the batting title, but was 121 plate appearances short of the required minimum of 502. From {{by|1982}} to {{by|1988}}, Boggs hit below .349 only once, hitting .325 in {{by|1984}}. From 1983 to {{by|1989}}, Boggs rattled off seven consecutive seasons in which he collected 200 or more hits, an American League record for consecutive 200-hit seasons that was later matched and surpassed by Seattle's [[Ichiro Suzuki]]. Boggs also had six seasons with 200 or more hits, 100+ runs and 40+ doubles. Although he would not win another batting title after 1988 (his batting title that year broke [[Bill Madlock]]'s Major League record of four by a third baseman), he regularly appeared among the league leaders in hitting.

In 1986, Boggs made it to the [[1986 World Series|World Series]] with the Red Sox, but they lost to the [[New York Mets]] in seven. The photo of him  [http://www.georgekalinsky.com/images/team/index4.html fighting back tears], taken by [[George Kalinsky]], photographer for the Mets, emblemized the emotions of many Red Sox fans after their team's loss at [[Shea Stadium]].

===New York Yankees===
In {{by|1992}}, Boggs slumped to .259 &ndash; one of only three times in his career that he failed to reach .300 &ndash; and at the end of the season he left the Red Sox, with whom he had spent his entire career. He was heavily pursued by two teams: the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] and the [[New York Yankees]] - he chose the Yankees when they added the third year to the contract that the Dodgers would not offer. Boggs went on to be awarded three straight all-star appearances, had four straight .300-plus seasons, and even collected two [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove Awards]] for his defense.

In 1996, Boggs helped the Yankees to their first World Series title in 18 years. It was the only World Series title earned by Boggs.
At a key juncture in the 4th game of the series, in the 10th inning, Boggs's "sharp eye and patience at the plate" enabled him to draw a bases loaded walk in the 10th inning of a tie game, driving in the winning run and shifting the momentum of the series in favor of the Yankees. [http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Wade_Boggs_1958] After the Yankees won the series in game 6, Boggs memorably celebrated by jumping on the back of an [[NYPD]] horse, touring the field with his index finger in the air - despite his self-professed fear of horses.

===Tampa Bay Devil Rays===
Boggs signed with the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] for the final two seasons of his career, in 1999 collecting his 3,000th hit. Despite his reputation as a singles hitter with limited power, he is the only player whose 3,000th hit was a [[home run]].<ref name="library"/> The historic ball was caught in the right field stands of [[Tropicana Field]] by Mike Hogan, a sports information director at the University of South Florida, who gave it back to Boggs at the conclusion of the game. Hogan had moved to Tampa just 10 days before the event. Boggs retired in {{by|1999}} after sustaining a knee injury, leaving with a career batting average of .328 and 3,010 hits.

==Legacy==
While not unique among non-pitchers, Boggs also recorded a few innings pitched at the Major League level. His main pitch was a [[knuckleball]], which he allegedly used 16 times (along with one [[fastball]]) in one shutout inning of pitching for the Yankees against the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Anaheim Angels]] in a 1997 game.

His own style included mental preparedness techniques, which consisted in visualizing four at-bats each evening before a game and imagining himself successfully getting four hits.

As of June 8, 1986, over the course of the previous 162 games (equivalent to a full season, though across two seasons) Boggs was hitting .400, with 254 hits in 635 at-bats.<ref>Boston Globe, June 9, 1986. p. 37.</ref>

In 1987, Boggs &ndash; who was up for a new contract following the season &ndash; hit 24 home runs, easily the most in any year of his career.

On April 7, 2000 his #12 was retired by the Tampa Bay Rays.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/feats/feats10.shtml|title= Retired Uniform Numbers in the American League|accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=Baseball Almanac.com}}</ref>  Although he has not had his number retired by the Boston Red Sox, he was inducted into the team's Hall of Fame in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/bos/history/feature_hall_of_fame.jsp|title= Red Sox Hall of Fame|accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=RedSox.com}}</ref>

===The Margo Adams affair===
Boggs garnered non-baseball related media attention in 1989 for his four-year extramarital affair with Margo Adams, a California [[mortgage broker]]. After Boggs ended the relationship in 1988, Adams filed a $12 million [[lawsuit]] for [[Intentional infliction of emotional distress|emotional distress]] and [[Breach of contract|breach of oral contract]]. She argued that Boggs had verbally agreed to compensate her for lost income and services performed while accompanying Boggs on road trips.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1D6133EF930A35750C0A96F948260 |title=THE LAW; At the Bar |accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=New York Times}}</ref> Boggs' reputation was further sullied when Adams agreed to an interview with [[Penthouse (magazine)|''Penthouse'' magazine]] in which she discussed intimate details of her time with Boggs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE0D7123FF930A15751C0A96F948260|title= BASEBALL; Gossip Checks In At Red Sox Camp |accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=New York Times}}</ref>  While acknowledging the affair, Boggs went on the offensive in order to combat the wave of negative press, denying many of the claims made by Adams. Boggs' rebuttal included an appearance on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] program ''[[20/20]]'' in which he presented his side of the story to [[Barbara Walters]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2D81F3EF936A15750C0A96F948260|title= SPORTS PEOPLE: BASEBALL; Boggs Speaks Out |accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=New York Times}}</ref>  In February 1989, an [[appellate court|appeals court]] threw out $11.5 million of the initial lawsuit, ruling that Adams could not seek compensation for emotional distress.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7D7103FF934A15751C0A96F948260|title= Big Hit for Boggs in Court |accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=New York Times}}</ref>  The remaining $500,000 was settled out of court later that year for an undisclosed amount.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4D9103CF930A25751C1A96F948260|title= SPORTS PEOPLE: BASEBALL; Boggs Settlement |accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=New York Times}}</ref>

===Hall of Fame plaque cap logo controversy===
Before his retirement, Boggs was plagued by newspaper reports that the expansion Devil Rays gave him financial compensation in return for selecting a Devil Rays cap for his plaque at the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]], though he has denied that any such condition was part of his contract.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/hallfame/2005-01-06-boggs-sandberg-questions_x.htm |title = "Boggs, Sandberg field queries as new Hall of Famers" |accessdate = 2008-05-21 |work = www.usatoday.com |publisher = USA Today}}</ref>  In light of those reports (and other rumors that teams were offering number retirement, money, or organizational jobs in exchange for the cap designation) the Hall decided in 2001 to change its practice of deferring to players' wishes regarding cap logo selection, and reinforced the Hall's authority to determine with which cap the player would be depicted. Boggs is wearing a Boston cap on his plaque.

===Superstitions===
Boggs was known for his [[superstition]]s. He ate [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] before every game ([[Jim Rice]] once called Boggs "chicken man"), woke up at the same time every day, took exactly 100 ground balls in practice, took batting practice at 5:17, and ran sprints at 7:17.<ref name="library">{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Wade_Boggs_1958|title= The Ballplayers - Wade Boggs Biography |accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=BaseballLibrary.com}}</ref>  His route to and from his position in the field beat a path to the home dugout. He drew the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word "[[Chai (symbol)|Chai]]", meaning "life", in the batter's box before each at-bat, though he is not [[Jew]]ish.<ref>''The Rundown.'' >{{cite web |url= http://www.npr.org/programs/waitwait/archrndwn/2005/aug/050806.waitwait.html |title= Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me|accessdate=2008-07-25 }} NPR. August 6, 2005</ref>

===Beer drinking===
Boggs is claimed to have once drunk 60-70 beers during a cross country flight, which originally received national attention via a sign in the background of an episode of ESPN's College Gameday before a Pittsburgh vs Virginia Tech football game. The rumor has become somewhat of a legend amongst college-aged males.  Tony Kornheiser and Michael Wilbon questioned Boggs on an episode of [[ESPN]]'s [[Pardon the Interruption]]. Boggs was quite cavalier leaving a slightly-ambiguous air to the whole situation.  Although denying the actual number, Boggs understood what could have precipitated the rumor,  "it was nothing to be proud of" he said and went on, "let's just say it was a few [[Miller Lite]]s."  The latter statement has resulted in the endearment of Miller Lites as "Boggs" or "Boggs Lite" to the aforementioned young crowd. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Gx8OmO9Rk|title=Wade Boggs likes beer}}</ref>
