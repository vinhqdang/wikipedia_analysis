'''Rugby union''', often simply referred to as '''rugby''', is a [[Contact sport#Full-contact|full contact]] team sport which originated in England in the early 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/originsofrugby.htm#2 |title=Origins of Rugby <U+2013> Codification "The innovation of running with the ball was introduced some time between 1820 and 1830." |publisher=Rugbyfootballhistory.com |accessdate=15 August 2011}}</ref> One of the [[Comparison of rugby league and rugby union|two codes]] of [[rugby football]], it is based on running with the ball in hand. It is played with an oval-shaped [[rugby ball|ball]] on a field up to {{convert|100|m|ft}} long and {{convert|70|m|ft}} wide with H-shaped goal posts on each goal line.

[[William Webb Ellis]] is often credited with the invention of running with the ball in hand in 1823 at [[Rugby School]] when he allegedly caught the ball while playing football and ran towards the opposition goal. However, the evidence for the story is doubtful. In 1845, the first football laws were written by Rugby School pupils; other significant events in the early development of rugby include the [[Blackheath F.C.|Blackheath Club]]'s decision to leave [[the Football Association]] in 1863 and the split between rugby union and [[rugby league]] in 1895. Historically an amateur sport, in 1995 the [[International Rugby Board]] (IRB) removed restrictions on payments to players, making the game openly professional at the highest level for the first time.

The IRB has been the governing body for rugby union since its formation in 1886. The spread of rugby union grew from the [[Home Nations]] of Great Britain and Ireland, and was absorbed by many of the countries associated with the British Empire. Early exponents of the sport included Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Countries that have adopted rugby union as their [[de facto]] national sport include Fiji, Georgia, New Zealand, Samoa, Tonga and Wales. Rugby union is played in over 100 countries across six continents and as of November 2010 118 unions were members of the IRB. 

The [[Rugby World Cup]], first held in 1987, takes place every four years, with the winner of the tournament receiving the [[Webb Ellis Cup]]. The [[Six Nations Championship]] in Europe and the [[Tri Nations (rugby union)|Tri Nations]] in the Southern Hemisphere are major international competitions held annually. Major domestic competitions include the [[Top 14]] in France, the [[English Premiership (rugby union)|English Premiership]] in England, the [[Currie Cup]] in South Africa, and the [[ITM Cup]] in New Zealand. Other transnational competitions include the [[Celtic League (rugby union)|Celtic League]], originally involving Irish, Scottish and Welsh teams and now Italian teams as well; [[Super Rugby]] (previously Super 12 and Super 14), involving South African, Australian and New Zealand teams; and the [[Heineken Cup]], involving the top European teams from their respective domestic competitions.

The origin of rugby football is reputed to be an incident during a game of [[English public school football games|English school football]] at Rugby School in 1823 when [[William Webb-Ellis]] is said to have picked up the ball and run with it.<ref>{{cite web|title = Webb Ellis, William|url = http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/webb-ellis.html|accessdate =14 September 2009}}</ref> Although the evidence for the story is doubtful,<ref>{{cite episode|title=Flotsam|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/qi/episodes/6/3/|series=QI|serieslink=QI|network=[[BBC]]|station=BBC One |location=UK|airdate=9 January 2009|seriesno=F|number=3}}</ref> it was immortalised at the school with a [[commemorative plaque|plaque]] unveiled in 1895.<ref>{{cite web|title = William Webb Ellis <U+2013> fact or fiction?|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/rugby_union/6255164.stm |first=Sean|last=Davies| publisher=bbc.co.uk  |accessdate =20 September 2011}}</ref> Despite the anecdotal nature of the sport's origin, the [[Webb Ellis Cup|Rugby World Cup trophy]] is named after him. Rugby football stems from the form of game played at Rugby School, which former pupils then brought to university; Old Rugbeian [[Albert Pell]], a student at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], is credited with having formed the first 'football' team.<ref name="Marshall13">{{Harvnb|Marshall|1951|p=13}}</ref> During this early period different schools used different rules, with former pupils from Rugby and [[Eton College|Eton]] attempting to carry their preferred rules through to their universities.<ref name="Marshall13-14">{{Harvnb|Marshall|1951|pp=13-14}}</ref>

Significant events in the early development of rugby football were the production of the first set of written football laws at Rugby School in 1845,<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=9}}</ref> which was followed by the '[[Cambridge Rules]]' drawn up in 1848.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/originsofrugby.htm#3 |title=Early Laws |publisher=Rugbyfootballhistory.com |accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref> Other important events include the Blackheath Club's decision to leave the Football Association in 1863<ref name="Godwin10">{{Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = The History of Football |url = http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/game/historygame4.html| work=FIFA.com| accessdate =25 February 2011}}</ref> and the formation of the [[Rugby Football Union]] in 1871.<ref name="Godwin10"/> The code was originally known as "rugby football"; it was not until after [[History of rugby league#The schism in England|the schism in England]] in 1895, which resulted in the separate code of [[rugby league]], that the sport took on the name "rugby union" to differentiate it from the league game.<ref>{{cite book|title=Rugby's great split: class, culture and the origins of rugby league football|author=Tony Collins|pages=87<U+2013>120|chapter=Schism 1893<U+2013>1895|edition=2nd|publisher=Routlage|year=2006|isbn=0-415-39616-6}}</ref> Despite the sport's full name of rugby union, it is known simply as rugby throughout most of the world.<ref>{{cite web|title = Warwickshire and Rugby Football |url = http://www.warwickshire.gov.uk/Web/corporate/pages.nsf/Links/25612031C7B03F9C80257610004A20CC | work=warwickshire.gov.uk| accessdate =26 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = A Short History of Civilization IV |work=Five Epochs of Civilization: Chapter 7 (2000) |url = http://worldhistorysite.com/civilization4.html| publisher=worldhistorysite.com| first=William |Last=McGaughey |accessdate =26 September 2011}}</ref>

Between 1905 and 1908, all three major Southern Hemisphere rugby countries sent their first touring teams to the Northern Hemisphere: [[The Original All Blacks|New Zealand]]  in 1905, followed by [[1906-07 South Africa rugby union tour|South Africa]] in 1906 and then [[1908-09 Australia rugby union tour of Britain|Australia]] in 1908. All three teams brought new styles of play, fitness levels and tactics,<ref name="Godwin, p18">{{Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=18}}</ref> and were far more successful than critics had expected.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thomas|1954|p=27}} ''"When they arrived in this country [Britain] they were regarded as an unknown quantity, but it was not anticipated that they would give the stronger British teams a great deal of opposition.

No international rugby games and union-sponsored club matches were played during the First World War, but competitions continued through service teams such as the [[New Zealand Army rugby team of 1919|New Zealand Army team]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=19}}</ref> The Second World War saw no international matches played by most countries though Italy, Germany and Romania played a limited number of games,<ref>[http://www.scrum.com/italy/rugby/match/19590.html Italy tour <U+2013> Bucharest, 14 April 1940] Romania vs Italy, Scrum.com</ref><ref>[http://www.scrum.com/italy/rugby/match/19591.html Italy tour <U+2013> Stuttgart, 5 May 1940] Germany vs Italy, Scrum.com</ref><ref>[http://www.scrum.com/italy/rugby/match/19592.html Romania tour <U+2013> Milan, 2 May 1942] Italy vs Romania, Scrum.com</ref> and [[Cambridge University R.U.F.C.|Cambridge]] and [[Oxford University RFC|Oxford]] continued their annual [[The Varsity Match|University Match]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=22}}</ref>

Rugby union was included as an event in the Olympic Games four times during the early 1900s. In 1973 the first officially sanctioned international sevens tournament took place at Murrayfield, as part of the [[Scottish Rugby Union]] centenary celebrations.<ref>{{cite web|title = Rugby in the Olympics: Future| url=http://www.irb.com/rugbyandtheolympics/future.html|work=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |date=|accessdate =18 August 2011}}</ref> In 1987 the first Rugby World Cup was held in New Zealand and Australia, and the inaugural winners were New Zealand.

===Forwards===
The main responsibilities of the forward players are to gain and retain possession of the ball.<ref name="talkrugby">{{cite web|url=http://www.talkrugbyunion.co.uk/guides/rugby_union_positions.html |title=Rugby Union Positions |publisher=talkrugbyunion.co.uk |date= |accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref> Players in these positions are generally bigger and stronger and take part in the scrum and lineout.<ref name="talkrugby"/> The forwards are often collectively referred to as the 'pack', especially when in the scrum formation.<ref name="Glossary">{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/page/97263.html|work=ESPN Scrum.com |title=Rugby Glossary |accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref>

'''Front row'''<br/>
The front row consists of three players, two props; the loosehead prop and the tighthead prop, and the hooker. The role of the two props are to support the hooker during scrums, to provide support for the jumpers during lineouts and to provide strength and power in rucks and mauls.<ref name="IRB BGRU 6"/> The third position in the front row is the hooker.<ref name="IRB BGRU 6"/> The hooker is a key position in attacking and defensive play and is responsible for winning the ball in the scrum.<ref name="IRB BGRU 6"/> Hookers normally throw the ball in at lineouts.<ref name="IRB BGRU 6"/>

'''Second row'''<br/>
The second row consists of two locks or lock forwards. Locks are usually the tallest players in the team, and specialise as lineout jumpers.<ref name="IRB BGRU 6"/> The main role of the lock in lineouts is to make a standing jump, often supported by the other forwards, to either collect the thrown ball or ensure the ball comes down on their side. Locks also have an important role in the scrum, binding directly behind the three front row players and providing forward drive.<ref name="IRB BGRU 6"/>

'''Back row'''<br/>
The back row, not to be confused with <U+2018>Backs<U+2019>, is the third and final row of the forward positions, they are often referred to as the loose forwards.<ref name="Glossary"/> The three positions in the back row are made up of two flankers and the number 8. The two flanker positions, called the blindside flanker and openside flanker, are the final row in the scrum. Their main role is to win posession through 'turn overs'.<ref name="IRB BGRU 6"/> The number 8 packs down between the two flankers at the back of the scrum. His role in the scrum is to control the ball after it has been heeled back from the front of the pack and the position provides a link between the forwards and backs during attacking phases.<ref name="IRB BGRU 7">{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/mm/document/training/0/beginners20guide20en_7391.pdf|work=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |title=A Beginner's Guide to Rugby Union |page=7|accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref>

===Backs===
The role of the backs is to create and convert point-scoring opportunities, they are generally smaller but faster and more agile than the forwards.<ref name="talkrugby"/> Another distinction between the two positions is that the backs are expected to have superior kicking skills, especially in the positions of fly-half and full-back.<ref name="talkrugby"/>

'''Half-backs'''<br/>
The half-backs consist of two positions, the scrum-half/half-back and the fly-half/First Five-Eighth. The fly-half is crucial to a team's game plan, orchestrating the teams performance.<ref name="IRB BGRU 7"/> They are usually the first to receive the ball from the scrum-half following a breakdown, lineout or scrum and need to be decisive with what actions to take and be effective at communicating with the outside backs.<ref name="IRB BGRU 7"/> Many fly-halfs are also their team's goal kickers. The scrum-half is the link between the forwards and the backs.<ref name="IRB BGRU 7"/> They receive the ball from the lineout and remove the ball from the back of the scrum, usually passing it to the fly-half.<ref name="IRB BGRU 8">{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/mm/document/training/0/beginners20guide20en_7391.pdf|work=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |title=A Beginner's Guide to Rugby Union |page=8|accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref> They also feed the scrum and sometimes have to act as a fourth loose forward.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bompa|1981|p=62}}</ref>

'''Three quarters'''<br/>
There are four three quarter positions, the inside centre/Second Five-Eighth, outside centre and left and right wings. Like the fly-half they generally possess a good kicking game and are good at reading the play and directing the attack. The centres will attempt to tackle attacking players whilst in attack their should employ speed and strength to breach opposition defences.<ref name="IRB BGRU 7"/> The wings are generally positioned on the outside of the backline. Their primary function is to finish off moves and score tries.{{sfn|Brown, Guthrie and Growden|(2010)}} Wings are usually the fastest players in the team and are either elusive runners, or more commonly in the modern era, big, strong and able to break tackles.<ref>{{cite news|title=Scottish rugby welcomes back Lomu|date=7 January 2006|first=David|last=Ferguson|url=http://sport.scotsman.com/superteams/Scottish-rugby-welcomes-back-Lomu.2740238.jp|newspaper=Scotsman|accessdate=1 September 2011}}</ref>

'''Fullbacks'''<br/>
The fullback normally positions himself several metres behind the back line. He fields any opposition kicks and is often the last line of defence should an opponent break through the back line.<ref name="IRB BGRU 7"/> Two of the most important attributes of a good fullback are dependable catching skills and a good kicking game.<ref name = "MacDonald">{{cite book|title=Rugger Practice and Tactics <U+2013> A Manual of Rugby Football Technique |first=H.

===Scoring===
Rugby union is played between two teams <U+2013> the one which scores more points wins the game. Points can be scored in several ways: a [[try]], scored by grounding the ball in the in-goal area (between the goal line and the dead ball line), is worth 5 points and a subsequent conversion kick scores 2 points; a successful penalty kick or a [[drop goal]] each score 3 points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/downloads/EN/Law_9_EN.pdf |work=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]]|title=Law 9 Method of Scoring |format=PDF |accessdate=15 August 2011}}</ref> The values of each of these scoring methods have been changed over the years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/scoring.htm |title=Scoring through the ages |work=rugbyfootballhistory.com  |accessdate=16 August 2011}}</ref>

===The playing field===
The field of play on a rugby pitch is as near as possible to a maximum of 144m long by 70m wide.<ref name="pitch size">{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/mm/Document/LawsRegs/0/Law1EN_7709.pdf |title=Law 1: The Ground|page=21|work=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |format=PDF |accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref> In actual gameplay there should be a maximum of 100m between the two trylines, with anywhere between 10 and 22m behind each try line to serve as the dead ball area.<ref name="pitch size"/> There are several lines crossing it, notably the half way line, the "twenty two", which is 22m from the goal line.<ref name="pitch size"/>

Rugby goalposts are H-shaped, and consist of two poles, 5.6m apart, connected by a horizontal crossbar 3m above the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/downloads/EN/Law_1_EN.pdf |title=Law 1 The Ground |page=1.4(a-b) |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |date= |accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref> The original pitch dimensions were in [[imperial units]], but have since been converted to the [[metric system]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/rugby_union/six_nations/618637.stm |title=A beginner's guide to ... rugby laws |work=BBC |date=31 January 2000 |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref><ref>Although the dimensions of the field have been converted to the metric system, some commentators still use the old imperial measures when referring to specific laws.</ref>

===Match structure===
At the beginning of the game, the captains and the referee toss a coin to decide which team will kick off first. Play then starts with a drop kick, with the players chasing the ball into the opposition's territory, and the other side trying to retrieve the ball and advance it. If the player with the ball is tackled, frequently a [[Playing rugby union#Ruck|ruck]] will result.<ref name=Midgley>{{Cite book| last = Midgley| first = Ruth| coauthors = | title = The Official World Encyclopedia of Sports and Games| publisher=Diagram Group| year = 1979| location = London| url =|page=394 | isbn = 0-7092-0153-2}}</ref>

Games are divided into 40-minute halves, with a break in the middle.<ref name="IRBLaw5">{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/downloads/EN/Law_5_EN.pdf |title=Law 5: Time |work=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |format=PDF  |accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref> The sides exchange ends of the field after the half-time break.<ref name="IRBLaw5"/> Stoppages for injury or to allow the referee to take disciplinary action, do not count as part of the playing time, so that the elapsed time is usually longer than 80 minutes.<ref name="IRBLaw5"/> The referee is responsible for keeping time, even when<U+2014>as in many professional tournaments<U+2014>he is assisted by an official time-keeper.<ref name="IRBLaw5"/> If time expires while the ball is in play, the game continues until the ball is 'dead', and only then will the referee blow the whistle to signal half-time or full-time; but if the referee awards a penalty or free-kick, the game continues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugby365.com/laws_referees/laws/578937.htm |title=Law 5 <U+2013> Time |date= 22 January 2007|accessdate=9 July 2010}}</ref>

===Passing and kicking===
Forward passing (throwing the ball ahead to another player) is not allowed; the ball can be passed laterally or backwards.<ref name="irblaws12">{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/downloads/EN/Law_12_EN.pdf |title=Law 12 Knock-on ot Throw Forward |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |date= |accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref> The ball tends to be moved forward in three ways <U+2014> by kicking, by a player running with it or within a scrum or [[Playing rugby union#Maul|maul]]. Only the player with the ball may be tackled or rucked. When a ball is knocked forward by a player with his/her arms, a "knock-on" is committed, and play is restarted with a scrum.<ref name="irblaws12"/>

Any player may kick the ball forward in an attempt to gain territory. When a player anywhere in the playing area kicks indirectly into [[Touch (rugby)|touch]] so that the ball bounces in the field of play the throw-in is taken where the ball went into touch.<ref name="irblaws12"/> If the player kicks directly into touch (i.e. without bouncing in-field first) from within their own 22 metre line the lineout is taken by the opposition where the ball went into touch, but if the ball is kicked into touch directly by a player outside the 22 metre line the lineout is taken level to where the kick was taken.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/downloads/EN/Law_19_EN.pdf |title=Law 19 Touch and Lineout |page=19.1(e-h) |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |date= |accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref>

===Breakdowns===
[[File:Tackle.JPG|thumb|A rugby tackle: tackles must be below the neck with the aim of impeding or grounding the player with the ball|alt=A child running away from camera in green and black hooped rugby jersey is in the process of being tackled around the hips and legs by an opponent.]]
The aim of the defending side is to stop the player with the ball, either by bringing them to ground (a tackle, which is frequently followed by a ruck), or by contesting for possession with the ball-carrier on their feet (a maul). Such a circumstance is called a breakdown and each is governed by a specific law.

A player may tackle an opposing player who has the ball by holding them while bringing them to ground.

It is illegal to push, shoulder-charge, or to trip a player using feet or legs, but hands may be used (this being referred to as a tap-tackle or [[Ankle tap|ankle-tap]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/downloads/EN/Law_10_EN.pdf |title=Law 10 Foul play |page=10.4(d) |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |date= |accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/downloads/EN/Law_10_EN.pdf |title=Law 10 Foul play |page=10.4(g) |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |date= |accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref>

Mauls occur after a player with the ball has come into contact with an opponent but the handler remains on his feet; once any combination of at least three players have bound themselves a maul has been set.<ref name="Glossary"/> A ruck is similar to the maul, but in this case the ball has gone to ground with at least three attacking players binding themselves on the ground in an attempt to secure the ball.<ref name="Glossary"/>

====Lineout====
:{{Main|Line-out}}

When the ball leaves the side of the field, a [[line-out (sports)|lineout]] is awarded against the team which last touched the ball.<ref name="irblaws19">{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/downloads/EN/Law_19_EN.pdf |title=Law 19 Touch and Lineout |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |date= |accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref> Forward players from each team line up a metre apart, perpendicular to the touchline and between 5 m and 15 m from the touchline.<ref name="irblaws19"/> The ball is thrown from the touchline down the centre of the lines of forwards by a player (usually the [[hooker (rugby union)|hooker]]) from the team that did not play the ball into touch.<ref name="irblaws19"/> The exception to this is when the ball went out from a penalty, in which case the side who gained the penalty throws the ball in.<ref name="irblaws19"/>

Both sides compete for the ball and players may lift their teammates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/downloads/EN/Law_19_EN.pdf |title=Law 19 Touch and Lineout |page=19.10 |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |date= |accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref> A jumping player cannot be tackled until they stand and only shoulder-to-shoulder contact is allowed; deliberate infringement of this law is dangerous play, and results in a penalty kick.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/downloads/EN/Law_19_EN.pdf |title=Law 19 Touch and Lineout |page=19.8(p) |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |date= |accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref>

====Scrum====

A scrum is a way of restarting the game safely and fairly after a minor infringement.<ref name="irblaws20">{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/downloads/EN/Law_20_EN.pdf |title=Law 20 Scrum |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |date= |accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref> It is awarded when the ball has been knocked or passed forward, when a player is accidentally [[Offside_%28rugby%29#Rugby_union|offside]] or when the ball is trapped in a ruck or maul with no realistic chance of being retrieved. A team may also opt for a scrum if awarded a penalty.<ref name="irblaws20"/>

A scrum is formed by the eight forwards from each team binding together in three rows.<ref name="irblaws20"/> The front row consists of the two props (loosehead and tighthead) either side of the hooker.<ref name="irblaws20"/> The second row consists of two locks and the two flankers. Behind the second row is the number 8. This formation is known as the 3<U+2013>4<U+2013>1 formation.<ref name="FormingScrum">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/rules_and_equipment/4205334.stm |title=Forming a scrum |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=13 August 2011 | date=14 September 2005}}</ref> Once a scrum is formed the scrum-half from the team awarded the ''feed'' throws the ball into the gap between the two front-rows known as the ''tunnel''.<ref name="irblaws20"/> The two hookers then compete for possession by hooking the ball backwards with their feet, while each pack tries to push the opposing pack backwards to help gain possession.<ref name="irblaws20"/> The side that wins possession transfers the ball to the back of the scrum, where it is picked up either by the number 8 or by the scrum-half.<ref name="irblaws20"/>

===Officials and offences===
There are three match officials: a referee, and two assistant referees.<ref name="IRBLaw6">{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/downloads/EN/Law_6_EN.pdf |title=Law 6: Match officials |work=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |format=PDF  |accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref> The latter, formerly known as touch judges, had the primary function of indicating when the ball had gone "touch"; their role has been expanded and they are now expected to assist the referee in a number of areas, such as watching for foul play and checking off-side lines.<ref name="IRBLaw6"/> In addition, for matches in high level competitions, there is often a television match official (TMO; popularly called the "video referee"), to assist with certain decisions, linked up to the referee by radio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/news-comment/peter-bills-refereeing-protocol-rules-over-common-sense-2242369.html |title=Peter Bills: Refereeing protocol rules over common sense |work=The Independent|first=Peter|last=Bills |accessdate=15 March 2011}}</ref> The referees have a system of hand signals to indicate their decisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coachingrugby.com/OpenPagesContent.do?requestType1=currentIssues/&requestType2=lawsSignals |title=Referee Signals |work=coachingrugby.com |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref>

Common offences include tackling above the shoulders, collapsing a scrum, ruck or maul, not releasing the ball when on the ground, or being off-side.<ref name="Law10">{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/downloads/EN/Law_10_EN.pdf |title=Law 10: Foul Play |work=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |format=PDF |page=70 |accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref> The non-offending team has a number of options when awarded a penalty: a "tap" kick, when the ball is kicked a very short distance from hand, allowing the kicker to regather the ball and run with it; a punt, when the ball is kicked a long distance from hand, for field position; a place-kick, when the kicker will attempt to score a goal; or a scrum.<ref name="Law10"/> Players may be sent off (signalled by a [[Penalty card#Red card|red card]]) or temporarily suspended ("sin-binned") for ten minutes ([[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]]) for foul play or repeated infringements, and may not be replaced.<ref name="Law10"/>

===Replacements and substitutions===
During the match, players may be replaced (for injury) or substituted (for tactical reasons).<ref name="Law3"/> A player who has been replaced may not rejoin play unless he was temporarily replaced to have bleeding controlled; a player who has been substituted may return temporarily, to replace a player who has a blood injury, or permanently, if he is replacing a front-row forward.<ref name="Law3"/> In international matches, up to seven replacements are allowed; in domestic or cross-border tournaments, at the discretion of the responsible national union(s), the number may be increased to eight, of whom three must be sufficiently trained and experienced to provide cover for the three front row positions.<ref name="Uncontested">{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid=2033086.html#irb+acts+uncontested+scrums |title=IRB acts on uncontested scrums |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |date=19 August 2009 |accessdate=23 September 2009}}</ref>

==Equipment==
[[File:Rugbyball2.jpg|thumb|right|A synthetic rugby ball|alt=An oval shaped synthetic ball, white in colour with red trim, adorned with the manufacturers name.]]
{{main|Rugby union equipment}}
The most basic items of equipment for a game of rugby union are the ball itself, a rugby shirt (also known as a "jersey"), [[rugby shorts]], socks and boots. The rugby ball is oval in shape, (technically a [[prolate spheroid]]), and is made up of four panels.<ref name="IRBLaw2">{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/mm/Document/LawsRegs/0/Law2EN_7708.pdf |title=Law 2 The Ball |page=27 |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |date= |accessdate=15 August 2011}}</ref> The ball was historically made of leather, but in the modern era most games use a ball made from a synthetic material. The IRB lays out specific dimensions for the ball, 280-300mm in length, 740-770mm in circumference of length and 580-620mm in circumference of width.<ref name="IRBLaw2"/> Rugby boots have soles with studs to allow grip on the turf of the pitch. The studs may be either metal or plastic but must not have any sharp edges or ridges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/downloads/EN/Law_4_EN.pdf |title=Law 4 Players' clothing (4.3b) |page=40 |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |date= |accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref>

Protective equipment is optional and strictly regulated. The most common items are [[mouthguard]]s, which are worn by almost all players, and are compulsory in some rugby-playing nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coachingtoolbox.co.nz/rugbysmart/protective-equipment/ |title=Protect Your Assets: Mouthguards |accessdate=23 September 2011|publisher= coaching toolbox.co.nz}}</ref> Other protective items that are permitted include a [[scrum cap|head gear]]; thin (not more than 10&nbsp;mm thick), non-rigid shoulder pads, and [[shin guard]]s; which are worn underneath socks.<ref name="dress">{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/mm/document/lawsregs/0/regulation12090603_8287.pdf |title=Regulation 12 Provisions relating to player dress |format=PDF |accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref> Bandages or tape can be worn to support or protect injuries; some players wear tape around the head to protect the ears in scrums and rucks. Female players may also wear chest pads.<ref name="dress"/> Although not worn for protection, some types of fingerless mitts are allowed to aid grip.<ref name="dress"/>

It is the responsibility of the match officials to check players' clothing and equipment before a game to ensure that it conforms to the laws of the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/EN/laws/2/4/36/before-the-match/players-clothing/inspection-of-players-clothing/#clause_36 |title=4.5 Inspection of players' clothing) |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |date= |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref>

The earliest countries to adopt rugby union were [[Rugby union in England|England]], the country of inception, followed by the other three Home Nations, [[Rugby union in Scotland|Scotland]], [[Rugby union in Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Rugby union in Wales|Wales]]. The spread of rugby union as a global sport has its roots in the exporting of the game by British expatriates, military personnel and over-seas university students. A rugby club was formed in Sydney, [[Rugby union in Australia|Australia]] in 1864; while the sport was said to have been introduced to [[Rugby union in New Zealand|New Zealand]] by Charles Munro in 1870, who played rugby while a student at [[Christ's College (Finchley)|Christ's College, Finchley]].<ref name="Godwin10"/> The first rugby club in [[Rugby union in France|France]] was formed by British residents in Le Havre in 1872, while the next year [[Rugby union in Argentina|Argentina]] recorded its first game: 'Banks' v 'City' in Buenos Aires.<ref name="Godwin11">{{Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=11}}</ref> In North America a club formed in Montreal in 1868, [[Rugby union in Canada|Canada's]] first club.

Several island states have embraced the sport of rugby, many introduced by British service personnel, but later spread the game to neighbouring countries as they searched for international opponents. Rugby was first played in [[Rugby union in Fiji|Fiji]] circa 1884 by European and Fijian soldiers of the Native Constabulary at [[Ba (town)|Ba]] on Viti Levu island.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=74}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/5392022.stm | title=Fire and flair: Fijian rugby |work=BBC Sport |first=Sean|last=Davies | date= | accessdate=20 September 2011}}</ref> Fiji then sent their first overseas team to [[Rugby union in Samoa|Samoa]] in 1924, who in turn set up their own [[Samoa Rugby Union|union]] in 1927.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=174}}</ref> Other countries to have national rugby teams in Oceania include [[Rugby union in the Cook Islands|the Cook Islands]], [[Rugby union in Niue|Niue]], [[Rugby union in Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]] and [[Rugby union in the Solomon Islands|the Solomon Islands]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://oceaniarugby.com/member_unions/foru_member_union_american_samoa.html | title=Member Unions |work=oceaniarugby.com | date= | accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref>

Although the exact date of arrival of rugby union in [[Rugby union in Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad and Tobago]] is unknown, their first club Carib RFC was formed in 1926, a national team was playing by 1927 and due to a cancelled tour to [[British Guiana]] in 1933, switched their venue to [[Rugby union in Barbados|Barbados]]; introducing rugby to the island.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=160}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=43}}</ref> Other Atlantic countries to play rugby union include [[Rugby union in Jamaica|Jamaica]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.irb.com/unions/union=11000064/index.html | title=Jamaica |work=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] | date= | accessdate=6 October 2011}}</ref> and [[Rugby union in Bermuda|Bermuda]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.irb.com/unions/union=11000040/index.html | title=Bermuda |work=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] | date= | accessdate=6 October 2011}}</ref>

The spread of rugby union in Europe has been sporadic. Historically, due to the lack of international games between the British and Irish home teams, who were more interested in facing the Southern Hemisphere giants of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the rest of Europe were forced to create a 'second tier' of international rugby matches. As a mainland country and during a period when they had been isolated by the British and Irish Unions, France became the only European team from the top tier to regularly play the other European countries; mainly [[Rugby union in Belgium|Belgium]], the [[Rugby union in the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Rugby union in Germany|Germany]], [[Rugby union in Spain|Spain]], [[Rugby union in Romania|Romania]], [[Rugby union in Poland|Poland]], [[Rugby union in Italy|Italy]] and [[Rugby union in Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]].<ref name="FIRA"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Dine |first=Philip |coauthors= |title=French Rugby Football |year=2001 |pages=79-94|publisher=Berg |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85973-327-1}}</ref> In 1934, instigated by the [[French Rugby Federation]], [[FIRA <U+2013> Association of European Rugby|FIRA]] (F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Rugby Amateur) was formed to organise rugby union outside the authority of the IRB.<ref name="FIRA"/> The founding members were {{runion|ITA}}, {{runion|ROM}}, {{runion|NLD}}, {{runion|CAT}}, {{runion|POR}}, {{runion|CSK}}, and {{runion|SWE}}. Other European rugby playing nations of note include [[Rugby union in Russia|Russia]], whose first officially recorded match is marked by an encounter between Dynamo Moscow and the Moscow Institute of Physical Education in 1933.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=148}}</ref> [[Rugby union in Portugal]] also took hold between the First and Second World Wars, with a Portuguese National XV set up in 1922 and an official championship started in 1927.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=130}}</ref>

Although Argentina is the most well known rugby playing nation in South America, founding the [[Argentine Rugby Union]] in 1899,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/8362870.stm | title=Puma power: Argentinian rugby |work=BBC Sport |first=Sean|last=Davies | date=16 November 2009 | accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref> several other countries on the continent also have a long history. Rugby had been played in [[Rugby union in Brazil|Brazil]] from the end of the 19th century, but the game was played regularly only from 1926, when S<U+00E3>o Paulo beat Santos in an inter-city match.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=48}}</ref> It took [[Rugby union in Uruguay|Uruguay]] several aborted attempts to adapt to rugby, led mainly by the efforts of the [[Montevideo Cricket Club]]; succeeding in 1951 with the formation of a national league and four clubs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=166}}</ref> Other South American countries to have set up a rugby union include [[Rugby union in Chile|Chile]] (1948),<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=58}}</ref> and [[Rugby union in Paraguay|Paraguay]] (1968).<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=127}}</ref>

Many Asian countries have a tradition of playing rugby going back to the time of the British Empire. [[Rugby union in India|India]] began playing rugby in the early 1870s, the [[Calcutta Football Club]] forming in 1872. The withdrawal of the British military from the area at the end of the decade saw rugby in India falter.

==Variants==

[[File:Spielszene BK.jpg|thumb|Beach Rugby match|alt=On a sunlit beach two teams of players, one in yellow the other in blue, play a form of rugby; the central yellow player runs forward clutching the ball with one hand, close to his chest.]]

The game of rugby union has spawned several variants of the full-contact, 15-a-side code. The two more common differences applied to the variants of the sport lie in either fewer players or reduced player contact. Of the variants, the oldest is [[Rugby sevens]] (7's, or VIIs), a fast-paced variant which originated in [[Melrose, Scotland|Melrose]], Scotland in 1883. In rugby sevens, there are only seven players per side, and each half is normally seven minutes. Major tournaments include the [[Hong Kong Sevens]] and [[Dubai Sevens]], both held in areas not normally associated with the highest levels of the 15-a-side game. A more recent variant of the sport is [[Rugby tens]] (10's or Xs), a Malaysian variant with ten players per side.<ref name=Completerugby1>{{Harvnb|Bath|1997|p=71}}</ref>

Due to the physical nature of playing rugby, several variants have been created to introduce the sport to children with a reduced level of physical contact.<ref name="IRB BGRU 14">{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/mm/document/training/0/beginners20guide20en_7391.pdf|work=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |title=A Beginner's Guide to Rugby Union |page=14|accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref> Of these versions, [[Touch rugby]], in which "tackles" are made by simply touching the ball carrier with two hands, is popular as a mixed sex version of the sport played by both children and adults.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/getting-a-kick-out-of-touch/story-e6frep5o-1225699224845 |title=Touch rugby league growing in Brisbane |first=Karl|last=deKroo| work=The Courier-Mail |date=11 April 2009 |accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfu.com/TheGame/~/link.aspx?_id=A4A528E2CC22410390D89AE5E46D1EF9&_z=z |title=Touch Rugby | work=[[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref> [[Tag Rugby]], is a version in which the participants wear a belt with two hook-and-loop fastener tags, the removal of either counting as a 'tackle'.

[[File:Fielding Yost-1902.jpg|thumb|left|225px|A game of [[American football]] between the [[University of Michigan]] and the [[University of Minnesota]] (1902). Earlier forms of the game had a more obvious kinship with their rugby equivalents.|alt=A grainy black and white photo of teams in sports jerseys and light padding contesting a play near the touchline, while watched by officials, coaches and crowds.]]

Rugby union football, and its immediate ancestor rugby football, has had a strong influence on several other sports. The [[Gridiron football|Gridiron codes]], [[American football]]<ref name=Completerugby2>{{Harvnb|Bath|1997|p=77}}</ref><ref name=Stubbs>{{Harvnb|Stubbs|2009|p=115}}</ref> and [[Canadian football]],<ref name=CanFitba1>{{Cite book |first=|title=Encyclopedia Canadiana|volume = 8|editor=John Everett Robbins| year=1972 |publisher=Grolier of Canada|location=Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal |page=110 |isbn=0717216012}}</ref> are derived from early forms of rugby. Confusingly, in Canada, [[Canadian football]] has also frequently been referred to as "[[rugby football]]",<ref name=CanFitba1/> and a number of national and provincial bodies were called "Rugby Football Unions" or "Rugby Unions", such as the [[Ontario Rugby Football Union|Ontario]] and [[Quebec Rugby Football Union|Quebec]] Rugby Football Unions.<ref name=CanFitba1/> For example, in the ''Encyclopedia Canadiana'', the entry ''Rugby Football'' begins by referring to "the Canadian development of rugby union or "English rugger" introduced into Canada in the third quarter of the nineteenth century", but later states that "the Canadian game is a radical departure from rugby union".<ref name=CanFitba1/>

[[Australian rules football]] has been influenced by a large number of sports, including [[Gaelic football]], rugby football and [[cricket]]. Many authors believe that the primary influence was [[rugby football]] and other [[English public school football games|other games originating in English public schools]].<ref name="See 1991, pp. 49-50">[[Geoffrey Blainey]], [[Leonie Sandercock]], Ian Turner and [[Sean Fagan]] have all written in support of this view. See, for example: Richard Davis, 1991, "Irish and Australian Nationalism: the Sporting Connection: Football & Cricket", ''Centre for Tasmanian Historical Studies Bulletin'', v.3, no.2, pp. 49<U+2013>50 and; B. W. O'Dwyer, 1989, "The Shaping of Victorian Rules Football", ''Victorian Historical Journal'', v.60, no.1.</ref> [[Tom Wills]], who is recognised as one of the pioneers of Australian Rules, also attended Rugby School.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/395810.html |last=Haigh |first=Gideon |title=Murder, suicide, cricket|work=espncricinfo.com |date=21 March 2009 |accessdate=28 August 2011}}</ref>

[[James Naismith]] took aspects of many sports including rugby to invent [[basketball]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1027613/index.htm |last=Wolff |first=Alexander |title=The Olden Rules|work=sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=25 November 2002 |accessdate=18 September 2011}}</ref> The most obvious contribution is the [[jump ball]]'s similarity to the lineout as well as the underhand shooting style that dominated the early years of the sport. Naismith played many years of rugby at [[McGill University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mcgilltribune.com/sports/profile-james-naismith-where-athletics-meets-religious-fervor-1.1627628#.TnapQdQdxF4 |last=Kanter |first=Jacob |title=Profile-James Naismith: Where athletics meets religious fervor|work=mcgilltribune.com |date=21 September 2010 |accessdate=18 September 2011}}</ref>

[[Swedish football (code)|Swedish football]] was a code whose rules were a mix of the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|association football rules]] and the [[rugby football|rugby football rules]].

Rugby lends its name to [[wheelchair rugby]] (also known as "quad rugby" or "murderball"), but the sport is more strongly influenced by [[wheelchair basketball]], [[ice hockey]] and [[Team handball|handball]] than rugby union.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iwrf.com/history.htm |title=About Wheelchair Rugby |work=iwrf.com |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref>

==Rugby union in culture==
<!-- The following section is for notable artists who have explored rugby or for works centered on the sport of rugby union. It is not intended for casual mentions of rugby in popular culture or trivial facts such as the Friends episode ''The One with all the Rugby''.-->
[[File:Henri Rousseau - The Football Players.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Henri Rousseau <U+2013> ''The Football Players'' (1908)|alt=An oil painting of two groups of a pair of moustached men wearing stripped jerseys and shorts, contesting a rugby ball within an avenue of trees.]]
The influence of rugby in culture can be assessed on the inspiration on artists and writers, as well as the impact of rugby players and administrators as role models and heroes to their countries' populace. Popular writers who have used rugby union within their books are numerous. Thomas Hughes 1857 novel [[Tom Brown's Schooldays]], set in Rugby School, includes a recount of a rugby football match, which was then portrayed in the 1940s film of the same name. James Joyce mentions Irish team [[Bective Rangers]] in several of his works, including Ulysses (1922) and Finnegans Wake (1939), while his 1916 semi-autobiographical work ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' holds accounts of Ireland international [[James Magee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bectiverangers.com/content/view/197/5|title=Bective Rangers <U+2013> James Joyce  |date= |work=bectiverangers.com |location=UK |accessdate=28 August 2011 }}</ref> Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in his 1924 Sherlock Holmes tale ''[[The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire]]'', mentions that Dr Watson played rugby for Blackheath.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/vampires/classicstory/sussexvampire_p1.shtml|title=The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire  |date=September 2005|work=BBC |location=UK |accessdate=28 August 2011 }}</ref>

Rugby union was the subject of early sketches representing the sport, but was also explored by notable artists, especially by early 20th century French painters. French Post-Impressionist [[Henri Rousseau]]'s 1908 work ''Joueurs de football'' shows two pairs of rugby players competing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/piece/?search=The%20Football%20Players&page=&f=Title&object=60.1583|title=Henri Rousseau |first=Cornelia |last=Lauf  |date= |work=guggenheim.org |accessdate=28 August 2011 }}</ref> Other French artists to have represented the sport in their works include [[Albert Gleizes]]' ''Les Joueurs de football'' (1912), [[Robert Delaunay]]'s ''Football. L'Equipe de Cardiff'' (1916) and [[Andr<U+00E9> Lhote]]'s ''Partie de Rugby'' (1917).<ref>{{cite book |last=Dine |first=Philip |coauthors= |title=French Rugby Football |year=2001 |page=19|publisher=Berg |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85973-327-1}}</ref> The [[Art competitions at the 1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Gold Medal for Art]] at the Antwerp Olympics was won by Luxembourg's [[Jean Jacoby]] for his work ''Rugby''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://olympic-museum.de/art/1928.htm|title=Art Competitions |date= |work=olympic-museum.de |accessdate=6 October 2011 }}</ref>

In television and film rugby union has been used as the backdrop to several productions. Ealing Studios' 1949 comedy ''[[A Run for Your Money]]'' and the 1979 television film from BBC Wales ''[[Grand Slam (1978 film)|Grand Slam]]'' both centre on the fans attending a match rather than the sport itself.<ref>{{cite book |last=Berry|first=David|title=Wales and Cinema, The First Hundred Years |year=1996 |publisher=University of Wales Press |location=Cardiff |page=215 |isbn=0-7083-1370-1}}</ref> Films that explore the sport in more detail include independent production ''[[Old Scores]]'' (1991) and ''[[Forever Strong]]'' (2008). ''[[Invictus (film)|Invictus]]'' (2009), based on [[John Carlin]]'s book ''Playing the Enemy'', explores the events of the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]] and Nelson Mandela's attempt to use the sport to connect South Africa's people post-apartheid.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/portal/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=&xml=/portal/2007/10/19/ftmandela119.xml|title=How Nelson Mandela won the rugby World Cup |accessdate=28 August 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=19 October 2007  | first=John | last=Carlin}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8406647.stm|title=South Africa 'rugby unity': Fact and fiction |date=11 December 2009|work=BBC News |location=UK |accessdate=28 August 2011 | first=Pumza | last=Fihlani}}</ref>

Many countries have erected statues depicting rugby union or rugby players. Some statues are found at rugby stadiums, such as pop-artist [[Gerald Laing]]'s 27&nbsp;ft bronze at [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/local/richmondnews/8196778.Iconic_sculpture_of_rugby_line_out_unveiled/ |title=RFU unveils iconic bronze of rugby line-out by sculptor Gerald Laing |date=2 June 2010 |work=yourlocalguardian.co.uk |location=UK |accessdate=28 August 2011 | first=Joanna | last=Kilvington}}</ref> and the [[Millennium Stadium]]'s life size work of rugby administrator Sir [[Tasker Watkins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/8360513.stm |title=Statue of Sir Tasker is unveiled |date=15 November 2009 |work=BBC News |location=UK |accessdate=23 September 2011 }}</ref> Rugby players to have been honoured with statues include [[Gareth Edwards]] in Cardiff and [[Danie Craven]] in Stellenbosch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugby365.com/schools/craven/2504760.htm |title=Craven of Craven Week |date=27 June 2010 |work=rugby365.com |accessdate=28 August 2011 }}</ref>
