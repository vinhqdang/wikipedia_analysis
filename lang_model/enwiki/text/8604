The '''Republic of South Africa''' is a country located at the southern tip of the [[Africa]]n [[continent]]. It borders the countries of [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Mozambique]], and [[Swaziland]]. [[Lesotho]] is an [[enclave]] entirely surrounded by South African territory.

South Africa has experienced a significantly different evolution from other nations in Africa arising primarily from two facts: immigration from [[Europe]] reached levels not experienced in other African communities and a level of mineralogical wealth that made the country extremely important to Western interests particularly during the [[Cold War]].  As a result of the former, South Africa is a very racially diverse nation. It has the largest population of people of [[Coloured]] (i.e., mixed racial background), [[Europe]]an, and [[Asians in South Africa|Indian]] communities in Africa.   Black South Africans account for roughly 75% of the population.

Racial strife between the white minority and the black majority has played a large part in the country's [[History of South Africa|history]] and [[Politics of South Africa|politics]], culminating in [[apartheid]] which was instituted in 1948 by the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], although segregation existed prior to that date. The laws that defined apartheid began to be repealed or abolished by the National Party in 1990 after a long and sometimes violent struggle (including economic sanctions from the international community) by the Black majority as well as some White, Coloured, and Indian South Africans.

The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]], and regular elections have been held for almost a century; the vast majority of black South Africans were only [[enfranchisement|enfranchised]] in 1994.  The [[Economy of South Africa|economy of South Africa]] is the largest and best developed on the continent, with modern [[infrastructure]] common throughout the country.

South Africa is often referred to as [[Rainbow Nation|The Rainbow Nation]] - a term coined by [[Archbishop]] [[Desmond Tutu]] and later elaborated upon by then-President [[Nelson Mandela]] as a metaphor to describe the country's newly-developing multicultural diversity in the wake of separatist [[apartheid]] ideology.

==History==
{{main|History of South Africa}}
South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological sites in Africa. Extensive [[fossil]] remains at the [[Sterkfontein]], [[Kromdraai]] and Makapansgat caves suggest that various [[australopithecus|australopithecines]] existed in South Africa from about three million years ago. These were succeeded by various species of ''Homo'', including ''[[Homo habilis]]'', ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and modern man, ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. [[Bantu]] [[iron]]-using agriculturists and herdsmen moved south of the [[Limpopo River]] into modern-day South Africa by the 4th or 5th century (the [[Bantu expansion]]). They slowly moved south and the earliest ironworks in modern-day [[KwaZulu-Natal Province]] are believed to date from around 1050. The southermost group was the [[Xhosa]] people, reaching the [[Fish River, Eastern Cape|Fish River]], in today's [[Eastern Cape Province]]. These [[Iron Age]] populations displaced earlier [[hunter-gatherer]] peoples as they migrated.

[[Image:JanVanRiebeckArrival.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Painting of an account of the arrival of [[Jan van Riebeeck]].]]
The written history of South Africa began on [[April 6]] [[1652]], when a victualling station was established at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] by [[Jan van Riebeeck]] on behalf of the [[Dutch East India Company]]. For most of the 17th and 18th centuries, the slowly expanding settlement was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] possession. The Dutch settlers eventually met the South-Westerly expanding [[Xhosa]] people in the region of the [[Fish River, Eastern Cape|Fish River]]. A series of wars, called [[Cape Frontier Wars]], ensued, mainly caused by conflicting land and livestock interests. To ease Cape labour shortages [[slaves]] were imported from [[Indonesia]], [[Madagascar]], and [[India]]. Descendants of these slaves, who often married with Dutch settlers, were later classified together with the remnants of the Khoikhoi as [[Cape Coloureds]] and "[[Cape Malays]]", constituting roughly 50% of the population in the [[Western Cape Province]].

[[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] seized the [[Cape of Good Hope]] area in 1797 during the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]]. The Dutch declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1805. The British continued the frontier wars against the AmaXhosa, pushing the eastern frontier eastward through a line of forts established along the Fish River and consolidating it by encouraging [[1820 Settlers|British settlement]]. Due to pressure of [[abolitionist]] societies in Britain, the British parliament first stopped its global [[slave trade]] in 1806, then abolished slavery in all its colonies in 1833.

The discovery of [[diamond]]s in 1867 and [[gold]] in 1886 encouraged economic growth and immigration, intensifying the subjugation of the natives. The [[Boers]] successfully resisted British encroachments during the [[First Boer War]] (1880&ndash;1881) using tactics much better suited to local conditions. For example, the Boers wore [[khaki]] clothing, which was the same colour as the earth, whereas the British wore bright red uniforms, making them easy targets for Boer [[sharpshooter]]s. The British returned in greater numbers without their red jackets in the [[Second Boer War]] (1899&ndash;1902), which was largely opposed by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in the [[British Parliament]]. The Boers' attempt to ally themselves with German [[South West Africa]] provided the British with yet another excuse to take control of the Boer Republics.
[[Image:Boercamp1.JPG|thumb|left|250px|[[Boer]] women and children in British [[concentration camp]]s.]]
The Boers resisted fiercely, but the British eventually overwhelmed the Boer forces, using their superior numbers and external supply chains and [[concentration camp]]s as well as the controversial [[scorched earth]] tactic. The [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] specified full British sovereignty over the South African republics, and the British government agreed to assume the [[British Pound|<U+00A3>]]3,000,000 war debt owed by the Afrikaner governments. One of the main provisions of the treaty ending the war was that 'Blacks' would not be allowed to vote, except in the Cape Colony.

After four years of negotiations, the [[Union of South Africa]] was created from the colonies of [[Cape Colony]], [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal Colony]], and the republics of [[Orange Free State]], and [[Transvaal]] on [[May 31]], [[1910]], exactly eight years after the end of the Second Boer War. The newly-created Union of South Africa was a [[dominion]]. In 1934 the [[South African Party]] and [[National Party (South Africa)|National Parties]] merged to form the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]], seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and [[English language|English]]-speaking 'Whites', but split in 1939 over the Union's entry into [[World War II]] as an ally of the [[United Kingdom]]. The right-wing National Party sympathised with [[Nazi Germany]] during the war, and sought greater racial segregation, or apartheid, after it.

In 1948, the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] was elected to power, and began [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|implementing a series of harsh segregationist laws]] that would become known collectively as [[apartheid]]. Not surprisingly, this segregation also applied to the wealth acquired during rapid industrialization of the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. While the White minority enjoyed the highest [[standard of living]] in all of Africa, often comparable to "[[first world]]" western nations, the Black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy.  However, the average income and life expectancy of a black, 'indian' or 'colored' south african compared favorably to many other african states such as [[Ghana]] and [[Tanzania]].

Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread [[sanction]]s and [[divestment]] abroad and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa. (See also special section on [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era]].) A long period of harsh supression by the government, and resistance, [[Strike action|strike]]s, marches, protests, and [[sabotage]], by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) followed. In 1990 the National Party government took the first step towards negotiating itself out of power when it lifted the ban on the African National Congress and other [[left-wing]] political organisations, and released [[Nelson Mandela]] from prison after 27 years. Apartheid legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and the first [[South African general election, 1994|multi-racial elections]] were held in 1994. The ANC won by an overwhelming majority, and has been in power ever since. South Africa is the first, and to date only, country to build [[nuclear weapon]]s and then voluntarily dismantle its entire [[nuclear weapons]] programme.

Despite the end of apartheid, millions of South Africans, mostly black, continue to live in [[poverty]]. This is attributed to the legacy of the apartheid regime and, increasingly, what many see as the failure of the current government to tackle social issues, coupled with the monetary and fiscal discipline of the current government to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. However, the ANC's social housing policy has produced some improvement in living conditions in many areas by redirecting fiscal spending and improving the efficiency of the [[tax]] collection system.

==Politics==
[[Image:CentralPretoria.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The central area of [[Pretoria]], the administrative capital of South Africa.]]
{{main|Politics of South Africa}}

South Africa has a bicameral [[Parliament]], comprising the [[National Council of Provinces]] (or upper house) with 90 members, and a [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] (or lower house) with 400 members. Members of the lower house are elected on a population basis by [[proportional representation]]: half of the members are elected from national lists and half are elected from provincial lists. Ten members are elected to represent each province in the National Council of Provinces, regardless of the population of the province. Elections for both chambers are held every five years. The government is formed in the lower house, and the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly is the [[President of South Africa|President]].

Current South African politics is dominated by the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), which received 69.7% of the vote during the last [[South African general election, 2004|2004 general election]] and 66.3% of the vote in the [[South African municipal election, 2006|2006 municipal election]]. The main challenger to the ANC's rule is the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] party, which received  12.4% of the vote in the 2004 election and 14.8% in the 2006 election. The leader of this party is [[Tony Leon]]. The formerly dominant [[New National Party (South Africa)|New National Party]], who introduced apartheid through its predecessor, the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], has suffered increasing humiliation at election polls since 1994, and finally voted to disband and ironically it chose to merge with the ANC on [[9 April]] [[2005]]. Other major political parties represented in Parliament are the [[Inkatha Freedom Party]], which mainly represents [[Zulu]] voters, and the [[Independent Democrats (South Africa)|Independent Democrats]], who took 6.97% and 1.7% of the vote respectively in the 2004 election.

==Provinces==
[[Image:South Africa Districts April 2006.png|thumb|350px|right|Map showing provinces (By colour, pale pink for [[Northern Cape]], turquoise for [[North West Province|North West]], purple for [[Gauteng]], green for [[Limpopo Province|Limpopo]], brown for [[Mpumalanga]], pink for [[KwaZulu-Natal]], yellow for [[Eastern Cape]], pale green for [[Free State Province|Free State]], and pale yellow for [[Western Cape]]) and districts (numbers) of South Africa]]
{{main|Provinces of South Africa}}

When apartheid ended in 1994, the South African government had to integrate the formerly independent and semi-independent [[Bantustan]]s into the political structure of South Africa. To this end, it abolished the four former provinces of South Africa ([[Cape Province]], [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]], [[Orange Free State]], and [[Transvaal]]) and replaced them with nine fully integrated provinces. The new provinces are usually much smaller than the former provinces, which theoretically is in order to give local governments more resources to distribute over smaller areas. The new provinces are:
{{SouthAfricaProvinces}}

These nine provinces are further sub-divided into 52 [[Districts of South Africa|districts]], six of which are [[Metropolitan municipality (South Africa)|metropolitan]] and 46 [[District municipality (South Africa)|district]] municipalities. The 46 district municipalities are further subdivided into 231 local [[Municipalities of South Africa|municipalities]]. The district municipalities also contain 20 district management areas (mostly game parks) which are directly governed by the district municipalities. The six metropolitan municipalities perform the functions of both district and local municipalities.

==Geography==
[[Image:Sf-map.png|framed|Map of South Africa]]
{{main|Geography of South Africa}}

South Africa is located at the extreme south of Africa, with a long [[coastline]] that stretches more than 2,500 [[kilometre]]s (1,550 [[mile|mi]]) and across two [[ocean]]s (the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]]). South Africa has a great variety of climate zones, from the extreme [[desert]] of the [[Kalahari]] near [[Namibia]] to lush [[subtropics|subtropical]] climate along the border with [[Mozambique]]. It quickly rises over a [[mountain|mountainous]] [[escarpment]] towards the interior [[plateau]] known as the [[Highveld]]. Even though South Africa is classified as [[semi-arid]], there is considerable variation in [[climate]] as well as [[topography]].

The interior of South Africa is a giant, mountainous, and sparsely populated [[scrubland]] [[Karoo]] plateau, which is drier towards the northwest along the Kalahari desert. In contrast, the eastern coastline is lush and well-watered, which produces a climate similar to the tropics. The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the [[Mediterranean]] with wet winters and hot, dry summers. This area also produces much of South Africa's [[wine]]. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many [[shipwreck]]s. Further east on the country's south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the [[Garden Route]].

The [[Orange Free State|Free State]] is particularly flat due to the fact that the eastern region of the Highveld does not extend as far north as the western region. North of the [[Vaal River]], the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat. [[Johannesburg]], in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740 [[metre]]s (5,709 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) and receives an annual rainfall of 760 millimetres (30 [[inch|in]]). Winters in this region are cold, although [[snow]] is rare.

To the north and east of Johannesburg, the altitude drops beyond the Highveld's escarpment, and turns into the [[Lowveld]]. The Lowveld has particularly high temperatures, and is also the location of traditional South African [[Bushveld]]. The high [[Drakensberg|Drakensberg mountains]], which form the eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited [[ski]]ing opportunities in winter. The coldest place in South Africa is [[Sutherland, South Africa|Sutherland]] in the western [[Roggeveld Mountains]], where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as &ndash;15 degrees [[Celsius]] (5 <U+00B0>[[Fahrenheit|F]]). The deep interior has the hottest temperatures: A temperature of 51.7 <U+00B0>C (125 <U+00B0>F) was recorded in 1948 in the [[Northern Cape]] Kalahari near [[Upington]].[http://www.safrica.info/ess_info/sa_glance/geography/geography.htm]

South Africa also has one possession, the small sub-antarctic archipelago of the [[Prince Edward Islands]], consisting of Marion Island (290 km<U+00B2>/112 mi<U+00B2>) and Prince Edward Island (45 km<U+00B2>/17.3 mi<U+00B2>) (not to be confused with the [[Prince Edward Island|Canadian province of the same name]]).

==Flora and fauna==
[[Image:Fynbos.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Fynbos]], a [[floristic province|floral kingdom]] unique to South Africa, is found near [[Cape Town]].]]
South Africa has more than 20,000 different [[plant]]s, or about 10% of all the known [[species]] of plants on [[Earth]], making it particularly rich in plant biodiversity. 

South Africa's most prevalent biome is [[grassland]], particularly on the [[Highveld]], where the plant cover is dominated by different [[Poaceae|grasses]], low [[shrub]]s, and [[acacia tree]]s, mainly camel-thorn and whitethorn. [[Vegetation]] becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low [[precipitation (meteorology)|rainfall]]. There are several species of water-storing [[succulent]]s like [[aloe]]s and euphorbias in the very hot and dry [[Namaqualand]] area. The grass and thorn [[Savanna|savannah]] turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the northeast of the country, with more dense growth. There are significant numbers of [[baobab]] trees in this area, near the northern end of [[Kruger National Park]]. [http://www.southafrica-travel.net/pages/e_plants.htm]

The [[Fynbos]] [[Biome]], one of the six [[floristic province|floral kingdom]]s, is located in a small region of the [[Western Cape]] and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of floral biodiversity. The majority of the plants are [[evergreen]] hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like [[leaf|leaves]], such as the [[sclerophyllous]] plants. Another uniquely South African plant is the [[protea]] genus of flowering plants. There are around 130 different species of protea in South Africa.

While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, it has few [[forest]]s. Only 1% of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the [[humid]] [[coastal plain]] along the [[Indian Ocean]] in [[KwaZulu-Natal]]. There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of [[fire]], known as montane forests. [[Plantation]]s of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native [[eucalyptus]] and [[pine]]. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many e.g. Black Wattle, Port Jackson, [[Hakea]], [[Lantana]] and [[Jacaranda]] posing a significant threat to the native [[biodiversity]] and the already scarce water resources. The original [[temperate forest]] that met the first European settlers to South Africa was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African [[hardwood]] trees like [[Real Yellowwood]] ''(Podocarpus latifolius)'', [[stinkwood]] ''(Ocotea bullata)'', and South African [[Black Ironwood]] ''(Olea laurifolia)'' are under government protection.

==Economy==
[[Image:CentralDurban.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Durban]], well-known resort city on the [[Indian Ocean]] coast and site of Africa's largest commercial port.]]
[[Image:Cape Town Waterfront.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Victoria & Alfred Waterfront]] in [[Cape Town]] with [[Table Mountain]] in the background. Cape Town has become an important [[retail]] and [[tourism]] centre for the country, and attracts the largest number of foreign visitors in South Africa.]]
{{main|Economy of South Africa}}

South Africa is a middle-income country with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors, a [[stock exchange]] (the [[JSE Securities Exchange]]), that ranks among the 10 largest in the world, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centres throughout the region. South Africa's per capita [[GDP]], corrected for [[purchasing power parity]], positions the country as one of the 50 wealthiest in the world. In many respects, South Africa is developed; however, this development is significantly localised around 4 areas, namely: Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Pretoria-Johannesburg. Beyond these 4 economic centres, development is marginal and poverty still reigns despite Government strategies. Large income gaps and a [[dual economy]] designate South Africa as developing. Only Brazil and India show a greater divide between its country's wealthy and poor residents{{citation needed}}. Consecutive growth rates in the last ten years are helping lower unemployment, however, the economy still has ways to go, and daunting economic problems remain from the apartheid era, especially the problems of poverty and lack of [[Black Economic Empowerment|economic empowerment]] among the disadvantaged groups. Other problems are crime, corruption, and HIV/AIDS. At the start of 2000, President Thabo Mbeki vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment by relaxing restrictive labour laws, stepping up the pace of privatisation, and cutting unneeded governmental spending. His policies face strong opposition from organised labour. It is estimated that South Africa accounts for up to 30% of the [[gross domestic product]] of the entire African continent. South Africa is also the continent's largest energy producer and consumer.

The [[Rand (currency)|Rand]], the world's most actively traded emerging [[market currency]], has joined an elite club of 15 currencies - the [[Continuous linked settlement]] (CLS) - where forex transactions are settled immediately, lowering the risks of transacting across [[time zone]]. The South African Rand (ZAR) was the best performing currency against the US Dollar between 2002 and 2005, according to the [[Bloomberg]] Currency Scorecard. The volatility of the [[Rand (currency)|Rand]] has affected economic activity, with the rand falling sharply during 2001, hitting an historic low of R13.85 to the [[United States dollar]], raising fears of inflation, and causing the Reserve Bank to increase [[interest rate]]s. The rand has since dramatically recovered, trading at R5.99 to the dollar as of January 2006 while the South African Reserve Bank's policy of inflation targeting has brought inflation under control. The stronger Rand has however put exporters under considerable pressure, with many calling for government to intervene in the exchange rate to help soften the rand, and many others dismissing staff.

21.5% of the adult South African population have been estimated to be [[HIV]] positive in 2004. The government has recently, after much delay, devoted substantial resources to fighting the epidemic. A recent study from the African Journal of AIDS Research by Thomas Rehle and Olive Shisana showed the infection rate starting to level off, from 4.2% to 1.7% infection rate for 15-49 year olds, and AIDS deaths peaking at 487,320 in 2008.

In 2000 President [[Thabo Mbeki|Mbeki]] publicly questioned the importance of HIV in causing [[AIDS]], controversially suggesting that the main cause was "poverty". [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/826742.stm] In 2001 the government appointed a panel of scientists, including a number of [[AIDS dissident]]s (who question the mainstream view on HIV), to report back on the issue. Following their report, the government stated that it continues to base its policy on the premise that the cause of AIDS is indeed HIV [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1260941.stm]. The controversy has not abated, and organisations such as the [[Treatment Action Campaign]] continue to mount political and legal challenges to what they claim is the government's slow response to the epidemic.

Refugees from poorer neighbouring countries abound with immigrants from the DRC, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and many others representing a large portion of the informal sector. With high unemployment levels amongst poorer South Africans, [[xenophobia]] is a very real fear and many people born in South Africa feel resentful of immigrants who are seen to be depriving the native population of jobs, a feeling which has been given credibility by the fact that many South African employers have employed migrants from other countries for lower pay than South African citizens, especially in the [[construction]], [[tourism]], [[agriculture]] and [[domestic service]] industries. Illegal immigrants are also heavily involved in informal trading. [http://www.iss.co.za/pubs/ASR/5No4/StrategigPerspectives.html] However, many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the South African immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994 [http://www.queensu.ca/samp/sampresources/samppublications/policyseries/policy20.htm].

==Agriculture==
[[Image:Farm in Mpumalanga.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Workers planting on a farm in the central area of [[Mpumalanga]].]]
[[Image:SouthAfricaFieldwork21989.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Farm workers]]
South Africa has a large agricultural sector, and is a net exporter of farming products. There are almost a thousand [[agricultural cooperative]]s and [[agribusiness]]es throughout the country, and agricultural exports constitute eight per cent of South Africa's total exports for the past five years. The agricultural industry contributes to around 30% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing towards around 2.6% of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] for the nation. However, due to the aridity of the land, only 15% can be used for crop production.

[http://www.southafrica.co.za/agriculture_29.html] Although the commercial farming sector is relatively well developed, people in some rural areas still survive on [[subsistence farming]]. It is the eighth largest wine producer in the world, and the eleventh largest producer of sunflower seed. South Africa is a net exporter of agricultural products and foodstuffs, the largest number of exported items being [[sugar]], [[grape]]s, [[citrus]], [[nectarine]]s, [[winemaking|wine]] and [[deciduous fruit]]. The largest locally produced crop is [[maize]], and it has been estimated that 9 million tons are produced every year, with 7.4 million tons being consumed. [[Livestock]] are also popular on South African farms, with the country producing 85% of all meat consumed. The dairy industry consists of around 4,300 milk producers providing employment for 60,000 farm workers and contributing to the livelihoods of around 40,000 others.

In recent years, the agricultural sector has introduced several reforms, some of which are controversial, such as [[land reform]] and the deregulation of the market for agricultural products. Land reform has been criticised both by farmers' groups and by landless workers, the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4718707.stm] and the former alleging racist treatment and expressing concerns that a similar situation to [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|Robert Mugabe's land reform policy]] may develop, a fear exacerbated by comments made by the country's [[Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka|deputy president]] [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4140990.stm]. The sector continues to face problems with increased foreign competition and crime being two of the major challenges for the industry.

Crime against commercial farmers is often, although not always, racially motivated as many South African commercial farmers are white. The rural farmer population has shouldered a great increase in attacks and harassment and has suffered as many as 1,700 [[farm murders]] since the end of apartheid in 1994, and this has caused many commercial farmers to flee the countryside for the protection of the gated communities of the cities and that offered by other nations. The government has been accused of not devoting enough time and money to tackle the problem as opposed to other forms of violent crime, or simply inefficiency and incompetence [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0,,2772-2100080,00.html].

Another issue which continues to affect South African agriculture is environmental damage caused by misuse of the land. To reverse the damage caused by land mismanagement, the government have supported a scheme which promotes [[sustainable development]] and the use of natural resources. [http://www.nda.agric.za/]

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of South Africa}}
South Africa is a nation of 44.8 million people of diverse origins, [[culture]]s, [[language]]s, and [[belief]]s. The 2001 [[Statistics South Africa]] [[census]] [http://www.statssa.gov.za/census01/html/default.asp] provided five [[race|racial]] categories by which people could classify themselves, the last of which, "unspecified/other" drew negligible responses, and these results were omitted. Results for the other categories were [[Black (people)|Black]] at 75%, [[White (people)|Caucasian]] at 13%, [[Coloured]] at 9%, and [[Asians in South Africa|Indian/Asian]] at 3%.

By far the major part of the population classified itself as African or black, but it is not culturally or linguistically homogenous. Major ethnic groups include the [[Zulu]], [[Xhosa]], [[Basotho]] (South Sotho), [[Bapedi]] (North Sotho), [[Venda people|Venda]], [[Tswana]], [[Shangaan|Tsonga]], [[Swazi]] and [[Ndebele people (South Africa)|Ndebele]]. Some, such as the Zulu, Xhosa, Bapedi and Venda groups, are unique to South Africa.

Other groups are distributed across the borders with South Africa's neighbours: The [[Basotho]] group is also the major ethnic group in [[Lesotho]]. The [[Tswana]] ethnic group constitute the majority of the population of [[Botswana]]. The [[Swazi]] ethnic group is the major ethnic group in [[Swaziland]]. The [[Ndebele people (South Africa)|Ndebele]] ethnic group is also found in [[Matabeleland]] in [[Zimbabwe]], where they are known as the [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Matabele]]. These Ndebele people are however in effect Zulu people because the language they speak is Zulu and they are the descendants of the Warrior [[Mzilikazi]] who escaped persecution from Shaka to settle in that part of the World. The [[Shangaan|Tsonga]] ethnic group is also found in southern [[Mozambique]], where they are known as the Shangaan.

The white population descends largely from colonial immigrants: [[Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]] [[Huguenot]], and [[United Kingdom|British]]. Culturally and linguistically, they are divided into the [[Afrikaner]]s, who speak [[Afrikaans]], and [[English language|English]]-speaking groups originated from British immigrants, although many small communities immigrating over the last century retain the use of other languages. The white population is on the decrease due to a low birth rate and emigration; as a factor in their decision to emigrate, many cite the high crime rate and the government's [[affirmative action]] policies.

The term "[[Coloured]]" is still largely used for the people of mixed race descended from slaves brought in from East and Central Africa, the indigenous [[Khoisan]] who lived in the [[Cape of Good Hope|Cape]] at the time, indigenous African Blacks, Whites (mostly the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]/[[Afrikaner]] settlers and the English) as well as an admixture of [[Javanese]], [[Malay]], [[India]]n, [[Malagasy]] and other European and Asian blood (such as [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[Burmese]]). The majority speak Afrikaans. Khoisan is a term used to describe two separate groups, physically similar in that they were light-skinned and small in stature. The [[Khoikhoi]], who were called ''Hottentots'' by the Europeans, were pastoralists and were effectively annihilated; the San, called [[Bushmen]] by the Europeans, were hunter-gatherers. Within what is known as the Coloured community, you will also find some more recent immigrants - Coloureds from the old [[Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]) and [[Namibia]], as well as immigrants of mixed descent from [[India]] and [[Burma]] ([[Anglo-Indians]]/[[Anglo-Burmese]]) who were welcomed to the Cape when India and Burma received their Independence.

The major part of the [[Asians in South Africa|Asian]] population of the country is [[India|Indian]] in origin, many of them descended from indentured workers brought in the 19th century to work on the [[sugar]] [[plantation|plantations]] of the eastern coastal area then known as [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]]. There is also a significant group of [[China|Chinese]] South Africans (approximately 100 000 individuals).

{{main|Culture of South Africa}}

It may be argued that there is no "single" culture in South Africa because of its ethnic diversity. Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety of South African cuisine. In addition to [[food]], [[music]] and [[dance]] feature prominently.

[[South African cuisine]] is heavily [[meat|meat-based]] and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a ''[[braai]]''. South Africa has also developed into a major [[wine]] producer, with some of the best [[vineyard]]s in the world lying in valleys around [[Stellenbosch]], [[Franschoek]], [[Paarl]] and [[Barrydale]].

There is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages, and have developed a unique style called [[Kwaito]]. Of note is [[Brenda Fassie]], who launched to fame with her song "Weekend Special", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]], while the [[Soweto String Quartet]] performs classic music with an African flavour. White and Coloured South African singers tend to avoid traditional African musical themes, instead preferring more European musical styles including such western metal bands such as [[Seether]]. There is a thriving market for [[Afrikaans]] music, covering all the [[genre]]s of Western music.

The country's black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that traditional dance and music survive; as blacks have become increasingly [[urbanization|urbanised]] and [[Western world|westernised]], aspects of traditional culture have declined. Urban blacks usually speak [[English language|English]] or [[Afrikaans]] in addition to their native tongue. There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of [[Khoisan languages]] which are not official languages, but are one of the eight officially recognised languages. There are small groups of speakers of [[endangered language]]s, most of which are from the Khoi-San family, that receive no official status; however, some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival.

The white minority lead lifestyles similar in many respects to whites found in [[Western Europe]], [[North America]] and [[Australasia]]. 

Despite considerable discrimination under apartheid, Coloureds tend to relate more to white South African culture rather than black South African culture, especially [[Afrikaans]]-speaking Coloured people whose [[language]] and [[religion|religious]] beliefs are similar or identical to white [[Afrikaner]]s. A small minority of Coloureds, known as [[Cape Malays]], are [[Muslim]].

[[Asians in South Africa|Asians]], predominantly of [[India]]n origin, preserve their own cultural heritage, languages and religious beliefs, being either [[Hinduism|Hindu]] or [[Sunni Muslim]], and speaking English, with Indian languages like [[Tamil language|Tamil]] or [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] being spoken less frequently. Most Indians arrived on the famous [[Truro (ship)|Truro ship]] as [[indentured servant|indentured labourers]] in Natal to work the Sugar Cane Fields.  There is a much smaller [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] community in South Africa, although its numbers have increased due to immigration from [[Taiwan]]. Since the Taiwanese were classified as White, rather than Asian, under apartheid, they tend to be more culturally similar to whites in many ways than they are to other Asians.

===Languages===
South Africa has 11 [[official language]]s: [[Afrikaans]], [[English language|English]], [[Ndebele language|Ndebele]], [[Northern Sotho language|Northern Sotho]], [[Sesotho language|Southern Sotho]], [[Swati language|Swati]], [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]], [[Tswana language|Tswana]], [[Venda language|Venda]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]]. In this regard it is [[List of national languages of India|second only to India]] in number. As a result, there are many official names for the country.

The country also recognises eight non-official languages: [[Fanagalo language|Fanagalo]], [[Khoe language|Khoe]], [[Lobedu language|Lobedu]], [[Nama language|Nama]], [[Ndebele language|Northern Ndebele]], [[Phuthi language|Phuthi]], [[San language|San]] and [[South African Sign Language]]. These non-official languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.

Many of the "unofficial languages" of the [[Bushmen|San]] and [[Khoikhoi]] people contain regional [[dialect]]s stretching northward into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming [[Extinct language|extinct]].

Many white South Africans also speak other [[Europe]]an languages, such as [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[German language|German]], and [[Greek language|Greek]], while many [[Asians in South Africa|Asians]] and [[India]]ns in South Africa speak [[South Asia]]n languages, such as [[Hindi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]].

There are [[Official names of South Africa|11 official names]] for South Africa, one for each of the official national languages. While each language is technically equal to every other, English has emerged recently as the chief-among-peers as it is the most widely spoken language across racial barriers as well as globally, even though it is not the most widely spoken language by population. Afrikaans has been downgraded in order to accommodate other official languages. The South African passport currently has only French and English on the front cover and lists the other official names of South Africa on an inner page.

==Crime==
Crime has been a major problem in South Africa since the end of [[Apartheid|apartheid]]. According to a [http://www.nationmaster.com/red/country/sf/Crime&b_cite=1 survey for the period 1998 - 2000] compiled by the [[United Nations]], South Africa was ranked second for [[assault]] and murder (by all means) per capita. On the positive side, total crime per capita is 10th out of the 60 countries in the data set. Nevertheless, crime has had a pronounced effect on society: many wealthier South Africans moved into [[gated community|gated communities]], abandoning the central business districts of some cities for the relative security of suburbs. This effect is most pronounced in Johannesburg, although the trend is noticeable in other cities as well. Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a big motivator for them to leave. Crime against commercial [[farmers]] has continued to be a major problem in the country, and has resulted in thousands either emigrating or giving up the profession. South Africa also has a bad record for [[Carjacking|car hijackings]].

However, violent crimes such as [[murder]] and [[robbery|robberies]] have decreased in recent years, with the year 2004 seeing a drop of 4.6% and 5.3% respectively for these two offences. The rape rate, however, showed no signs of such a slowdown. [http://crimepages.co.za/news.htm] Recently the government has had a widely-publicised [[gun]] [[amnesty]] programme to recall the many weapons still in circulation from the apartheid era violence and wars in neighbouring countries like [[Mozambique]]. In addition, it adopted the National Crime Prevention Strategy in 1996, which aimed to prevent crime through reinforcing community structures and helping individuals back into work. [http://www.ipt.co.za/crimeprevention.asp]

The government is criticised for doing too little to stop crime. Some question the effectiveness of the [[South African Police Service]], which is known to make use of private security firms to protect its police stations. It must be pointed out, however, that due to the high crime rate in South Africa, many private individuals also make use of these systems.

Most private individuals and households in South Africa make use of private security firms such as [[ADT Security Services|ADT]]. While the police force in South Africa is competent to do its job, their equipment is not: due to a lack of funds there is a shortage of officers, patrol cars and administration (IT Systems).

== Military ==
{{main|South African National Defence Force}}
South Africa's [[armed force]]s, known as the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), was created in 1994. Previously known simply as the South African Defence Force (SADF), the new force consists of the forces of the old SADF, as well as the military forces of the organisations fighting for liberation, namely [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (MK), [[APLA]], and the former [[homeland]] defence forces. The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the [[South African Army]], the [[South African Air Force]], the [[South African Navy]], and the [[South African Medical Service|South African Military Health Services]].

In recent years, the SANDF has become a major [[peacekeeping]] force in Africa, and has been involved in operations in [[Lesotho]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and [[Burundi]], amongst others. It has also participated as a part of multi-national [[UN]] peacekeeping forces. South Africa is the only country ever to [[South Africa and weapons of mass destruction|develop nuclear weapon]]s on the African continent and to subsequently give them up.

==Media==
{{main|Media in South Africa}}
South Africa has a large, free, and active press that regularly challenges the government, a habit formed during the apartheid era when the press was the medium least controlled by the government. Major [[scandal]]s have erupted when the press reported charges of [[political corruption|corruption]] that were proven to be true in cases such as that of [[Schabir Shaik]], in which (then) deputy president [[Jacob Zuma]] was implicated, and the corruption allegations that led to the dismissal of [[Winnie Mandela]] from parliament. The government's stance on the [[Zimbabwe parliamentary elections, 2005|2005 Zimbabwe parliamentary elections]] and [[AIDS]] have also attracted plenty of coverage. 

Even though South Africa now has the most sophisticated media network in Africa, it was one of the last countries in the world to allow [[Television in South Africa|television]], with colour TV broadcasts commencing in 1975. By the end of [[apartheid]] in 1994, television networks covered all [[List of cities in South Africa|urban areas]] and some less populated areas, while radio networks covered almost all of the country.

During the Apartheid era the majority of commercial and all public-service radio stations and all of the television channels were operated by the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), and were subject to strict control and censorship by the government, with a few independent regional stations allowed. The creation of the independent black homelands (or Bantustans) in the 1970s allowed for the establishment of TV and radio stations outside of the control of the apartheid Government. Following the demise of apartheid, the broadcasting industry was de-regulated with many of the commercial regional SABC radio stations and former Bantustan stations privatised and sold to companies and consortiums that were majority owned by black people. Three SABC television channels are in place at present.

An African language channel was introduced to the [[SABC]] in 1981 (during [[apartheid]]) with a second African language channel added later in the decade. The SABC's television monopoly was eventually challenged in 1986 when a new privately owned subscription television network, [[M-Net]], was launched. M-Net was forbidden to operate a news service.

South Africa currently has two terrestrial free-to-air television networks (SABC and [[Etv (South Africa)|e.tv]]), one subscription based terrestrial network (M-Net), as well as has access to satellite television ([[DStv]]) which is operated by M-Net's owners, Multichoice. e.tv is allowed to operate an independent television news service. The SABC broadcasts news and entertainment channels Africa-wide via satellite. 

The SABC enforces a "TV Licence" fee.
