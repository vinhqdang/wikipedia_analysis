'''Ann Arbor''' is a city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]] and the [[county seat]] of [[Washtenaw County, Michigan|Washtenaw County]]. It is the state's seventh largest city with a population of 114,024 as of the [[United States 2000 Census|2000 census]], of which 36,892 (32%) are college or graduate students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=16000US2603000&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_DP2&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&-_lang=en&-_sse=on|title=Ann Arbor city, Michigan - DP-2. Profile of Selected Social Characteristics: 2000| year=2000 | publisher=US Census Bureau | accessdate=2007-02-12}}</ref> Supposedly named for the spouses of the city's founders and for the stands of trees in the area, Ann Arbor is best known as the location of the main campus of the [[University of Michigan]], which moved from [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] in 1837.

The city's economy, which was once noted for production of agricultural implements, carriages, furniture, pianos, organs, pottery, and flour, is now dominated by [[education]], [[high tech]], and [[biotechnology]]. Average home prices and property taxes are well above the state and national medians. The city is also known as a center for [[left-wing politics]], and contains many restaurants and performance venues.
__TOC__
==History==
{{main|History of Ann Arbor, Michigan}}
Ann Arbor was founded in January 1824 by John Allen and Elisha Rumsey, both of whom were land speculators. There are various accounts concerning the origin of the settlement's name; one states that Allen and Rumsey decided to name it "Annsarbour" for their spouses, both named Ann, and for the stands of [[bur oak|burr oak]] in the 640 [[acre]]s (260&nbsp;[[hectare|ha]]) of land they had purchased for [[United States dollar|$]]800 from the federal government.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://moaa.aadl.org/PictHistory/footnote.php#Annarbour | title=1824-1859: Ann Arbor/Annarbour - the Naming of Ann Arbor. ''Pictorial History of Ann Arbor: 1824-1974'' | year=2003 | publisher=Ann Arbor District Library | accessdate=2007-02-19}}</ref> The regional [[Native Americans (U.S.)|Native Americans]] named the settlement ''Kaw-goosh-kaw-nick'', after the sound of Allen's grist mill.

Ann Arbor became the seat of Washtenaw County in 1827, and was incorporated as a village in 1833. The town set aside 40&nbsp;acres (16&nbsp;ha) of undeveloped land and offered it to the State of Michigan as the site of the state capital, but it lost the bid to [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] in 1836. In 1837, the unused land was given to the [[University of Michigan]], forever linking Ann Arbor and its history with the university.<ref>{{cite book | title=A History of Ann Arbor | author=Marwil, Jonathan | year=June 15, 1991 | publisher=University of Michigan Press | id=ISBN 0-472-06463-0|pages=13}}</ref> The town became a regional transportation hub in 1839 with the arrival of the [[Michigan Central Railroad]], and in 1851 Ann Arbor was chartered as a city.

During [[World War II]], [[Ford Motor Company]]'s nearby [[Willow Run]] plant turned out [[B-24 Liberator]] bombers. The population of Ann Arbor exploded with an influx of military personnel, war workers, and their families.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a reputation as an important center for liberal politics. Presidential candidate [[John F. Kennedy]] unveiled his [[Peace Corps]] proposal in 1960 at the University of Michigan, and President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] first called for a "[[Great Society]] at the university in 1964."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://moaa.aadl.org/PictHistory/1940-1974pg4.php | title=1940-1974: Progress and Preservation. ''Pictorial History of Ann Arbor: 1824-1974'' | year=2003 | publisher=Ann Arbor District Library | accessdate=2007-02-19}}</ref> The city also became a locus for left-wing activism, and served as a hub for the [[American civil rights movement|civil-rights movement]] and [[Opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War movement]], as well as the student movement. The first major meetings of the national left-wing campus group [[Students for a Democratic Society]] took place in Ann Arbor in 1960; in 1965, the city was home to the first U.S. [[teach-in]] against the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://moaa.aadl.org/PictHistory/1940-1974pg3.php | title=1940-1974: From Protest to Outer Space. ''Pictorial History of Ann Arbor: 1824-1974'' | year=2003 | publisher=Ann Arbor District Library | accessdate=2007-02-19}}</ref> During the ensuing fifteen years, many [[counterculture|countercultural]] and [[New Left]] enterprises sprang up and developed strong constituencies within the city.

[[Image:SouthU.jpg|thumb|South University Avenue caters to young people.]]
These influences washed into municipal politics during the early and mid-1970s when three members of the local, progressive [[Human Rights Party]] (HRP) won city-council seats on the strength of the student vote. During their time on the council, HRP representatives fought for measures including pioneering [[civil rights|antidiscrimination]] ordinances, [[Marijuana laws in Ann Arbor, Michigan|measures decriminalizing marijuana possession]], and a [[rent control|rent-control]] ordinance; many of these remain in effect in modified form.

Alongside these liberal and left-wing efforts, a small group of conservative institutions were born in Ann Arbor. These include [[Word of God (community)|Word of God]] (established in 1967), a charismatic inter-denominational movement of national scope;<ref>{{cite web | url=http://moaa.aadl.org/PictHistory/1940-1974pg3.php | title=1940-1974: From Protest to Outer Space. ''Pictorial History of Ann Arbor: 1824-1974'' | year=2003 | publisher=Ann Arbor District Library | accessdate=2007-02-19}}</ref> and the [[Thomas More Law Center]] (established in 1999), a leading religious-conservative advocacy group.

The economy of Ann Arbor underwent a gradual shift from a manufacturing base to a service and technology base during the 20th century, which accelerated in the 1970s and 1980s. At the same time, the downtown transformed from one dominated by retail establishments dealing in staple goods to one composed mainly of eateries, caf<U+00E9>s, bars, clubs, and specialty shops. Over the past several decades, Ann Arbor has increasingly found itself grappling with the effects of sharply rising land values and [[gentrification]], as well as [[urban sprawl]] stretching far into the outlying countryside. On [[November 2]], [[2004]], voters approved a [[greenbelt]] plan under which the city government would buy development rights to pieces of land adjacent to Ann Arbor to preserve them from sprawling development. Since then, a vociferous local debate has hinged on whether, and how, to accommodate and guide development within city limits.

==Geography and cityscape==
[[Image:NicholsArb.JPG|thumb|right|Ann Arbor's many trees are the result of a reforestation campaign in the early 20th century.]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has an area of 27.7&nbsp;[[square mile]]s (71.7&nbsp;[[square kilometre|km<U+00B2>]]); 27.0&nbsp;square miles (70.0&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) is land and 0.7 square miles (1.7&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) or 2.42% is water, much of which is part of the [[Huron River (Michigan)|Huron River]]. Ann Arbor is approximately 40&nbsp;[[mile]]s (64&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]) west of [[Detroit]]. [[Ann Arbor Charter Township, Michigan|Ann Arbor Charter Township]] is adjacent, on the city's north and east sides. Ann Arbor is situated on the [[Huron River (Michigan)|Huron River]], in a productive agricultural and fruit-growing region. The landscape of Ann Arbor consists of hills and [[valley]]s, with the terrain becoming steeper near the Huron River. The elevation ranges from about 750&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (230&nbsp;[[metre|m]]) along the Huron River to about 900&nbsp;feet (275&nbsp;m) above sea level in southern and northeastern Ann Arbor.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?lat=42.27083&lon=-83.72639 | title=Ann Arbor, USGS Ann Arbor East (MI) Topo Map | publisher=TopoZone | year=2005 | accessdate=2005-06-15}}</ref> The elevation is about 839&nbsp;feet (256&nbsp;m) at Ann Arbor Municipal Airport, which is at {{coor dm|42|13.38|N|83|44.74|W|region:US}}.

Ann Arbor's "Tree Town" nickname stems from the dense forestation of its parks and residential areas. The city holds more than 50,000 trees sited along city streets and an equal number in city parks.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.annarbor.org/aboutannarbor/funfacts.asp | title=Fun Facts | year=2005 | publisher=Ann Arbor Area Convention and Visitor's Bureau | accessdate=2005-09-06}}</ref> In recent years, the [[emerald ash borer]] has destroyed many of the city's approximately 10,500 [[ash tree]]s. The city contains 147 municipal parks, ranging from small neighborhood parks to large recreation areas, with several large city parks and a university park bordering sections of the Huron River. The largest are Argo Park, Riverside Park, County Farm Park, and Gallup Park (near the Huron Parkway), while Fuller Recreation Area, near the [[University of Michigan Health System|University Hospital]] complex, contains sports fields, pedestrian and [[bike path]]s, and swimming pools. [[Nichols Arboretum]], which is owned jointly by the City of Ann Arbor and the [[University of Michigan]] (and known locally as "The Arboretum" or simply "The Arb"), is a 123-acre (50&nbsp;[[hectare|ha]]) preserve containing hundreds of plant and tree species on the east side of the city near downtown.

The Kerrytown Shops, Main Street Business District, the State Street Business District, and the South University Business District are commercial areas in downtown. Three commercial areas south of downtown include the areas near [[Interstate 94|I-94]] and Ann Arbor-Saline Road, Briarwood Mall, and the South Industrial area. Other commercial areas include the Arborland/Washtenaw Avenue and Packard Road merchants on the east side, the Plymouth Road area in the northeast, and the Westgate/West Stadium areas on the west side. The downtown contains a mix of 19th and early 20th century structures and modern-style buildings, as well as a [[farmers' market]] in the Kerrytown district. The city's commercial districts are composed mostly of two to four-story structures, although the downtown and the area near Briarwood Mall contain a small number of high-rise buildings.

Ann Arbor's residential neighborhoods contain a range of architectural styles, from classic 19th and early 20th century designs to [[ranch-style house]]s. Contemporary-style houses are farther from the downtown district. Surrounding the University of Michigan campus are houses and apartment complexes occupied primarily by student renters. The 19th century buildings and streetscape of the Old West Side neighborhood have been preserved virtually intact; in 1972, the district was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and it is further protected by city ordinances and a nonprofit preservation group.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oldwestside.org/ | title=Neighborhood Association | publisher=Old West Side Association | year=2007 | accessdate=2006-06-04}}</ref>

==Climate==
Ann Arbor has a typically [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] seasonal climate, which is influenced by the [[Great Lakes]]. There are four seasons, with winters being cold with moderate [[snowfall]] while summers can be warm and humid. The area experiences [[lake effect]], primarily in the form of increased cloudiness during late fall and early winter.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.michiganvacations.com/regions/Ann-Arbor-Michigan.html | title=Ann Arbor | publisher=MichiganVacations.com | year=2005 | accessdate=2005-08-18}}</ref> The highest average temperature is in July at 83&nbsp;<U+00B0>[[Fahrenheit|F]] (28&nbsp;<U+00B0>[[Celsius|C]]) while the lowest average temperature is in January at 16&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (<U+2212>9&nbsp;<U+00B0>C). However, summer temperatures can top 90&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (32&nbsp;<U+00B0>C), and winter temperatures can drop below 0&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (<U+2212>17&nbsp;<U+00B0>C). Average monthly precipitation ranges from 2 to 4&nbsp;[[inch]]es (44 to 92&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]]), with the heaviest occurring during the summer months. Snowfall, which normally occurs from November to April, ranges from 1 to 10&nbsp;inches (3 to 25&nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]]) per month.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wunderground.com/NORMS/DisplayNORMS.asp?AirportCode=KYIP&SafeCityName=Ann_Arbor&StateCode=MI&Units=none&IATA=DTW | title=Average High/Low Temperatures for KYIP | year=2005 |publisher=Weather Underground (wunderground.com) | accessdate=2005-08-17}}</ref> The highest recorded temperature was 105&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (40.6&nbsp;<U+00B0>C) on [[July 24]], [[1934]], while the lowest recorded temperature was <U+2212>22.0&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (<U+2212>30&nbsp;<U+00B0>C) on [[January 19]], [[1994]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://weather.yahoo.com/climo/USMI0028_f.html | title=Records and Averages <U+2014> Ann Arbor | publisher=Ann Arbor Weather Forecasts on Yahoo!

==Law and government==
[[Image:AACityHall.JPG|thumb|The Guy C. Larcom, Jr. Municipal Building houses the city hall and police station]]
Ann Arbor has a [[mayor]]-[[city council|council]] form of government. The mayor, who is elected every even-numbered year, is the presiding officer of the City Council and has the power to appoint all Council committee members as well as board and commission members, with the approval of the City Council. The mayor of Ann Arbor is [[John Hieftje]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]), who has served in that capacity since the 2000 election. The City Council has ten members, two from each of the city's five wards, with the mayor wielding the tie-breaking vote. Council members serve two-year terms; half the council is elected in annual elections.

Ann Arbor is in the 15th Congressional district, and is represented by Representative [[John Dingell]] (Democrat). On the state level, the city is in the 18th district in the [[Michigan Senate]]. In the [[Michigan State House of Representatives]], the city of Ann Arbor is in the 53rd district, while northeastern Ann Arbor and Ann Arbor Township are in the 52nd district.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.arborweb.com/govtindex.html | title=Ann Arbor Government Guide | publisher=Arborweb.com | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-02-19}}</ref> As the seat of [[Washtenaw County, Michigan|Washtenaw County]], the city is the location of the county's trial, civil, and criminal courts. Ann Arbor is the site of a [[United States district court]], whose downtown building also houses a [[post office]].

Left-wing politics have been particularly strong in municipal government since the 1960s <U+2013> an orientation evident in the passage of [[rent control|rent-control]] and strong [[civil rights|antidiscrimination]] ordinances. Voters also approved charter amendments that have [[Marijuana laws in Ann Arbor, Michigan|lessened the penalties]] for possession of marijuana (1974), and that aim to protect access to [[abortion]] in the city should it ever become illegal in the State of Michigan (1990). In 1974, [[Kathy Kozachenko|Kathy Kozachenko]]'s victory in an Ann Arbor city-council race made her the country's first openly [[homosexual]] candidate to win public office. In 1975, Ann Arbor became the first U.S. city to use [[instant-runoff voting]] for a mayoral race. Adopted through a ballot initiative sponsored by the local [[Human Rights Party]], which feared a splintering of the liberal vote, the process was repealed in 1976 after use in only one election. As of December 2006, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] hold the mayorship and all council seats.

Ann Arbor has seven sister cities:
*{{flagicon|Germany}} - [[T<U+00FC>bingen]], [[Germany]], since [[1965]]
*{{flagicon|Belize}} - [[Belize City]], [[Belize]], since [[1967]]

==Economy==
The University of Michigan shapes Ann Arbor's economy significantly. It employs approximately 30,000 workers, including about 7,500 in the medical center.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Midwest/Ann-Arbor-Economy.html | title=Ann Arbor: Economy | publisher=city-data.com | year=2006 | accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref> Other employers are drawn to the area by the university's research and development money, and by its graduates. [[High tech]], health services and [[biotechnology]] are other major components of the city's economy; numerous medical offices, laboratories, and associated companies are located in the city. [[Automobile industry|Automobile manufacturers]], such as [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], also employ residents.

[[Image:NicholsArcadeAnnArbor.jpg|thumb|Nickels Arcade interior, looking towards the east]]
Many high-tech companies are located in the city. During the 1980s, Ann Arbor Terminals manufactured a video-display terminal called the Ann Arbor Ambassador. Other high-tech companies in the area include Arbor Networks (provider of Internet traffic engineering and security systems), Arbortext (provider of XML-based publishing software), [[JSTOR]] (the digital scholarly journal archive), MediaSpan Media Software (provider of newspaper publishing software and ASP services), and [[ProQuest]], which includes [[UMI]].

Websites and online media companies in the city include [[All Media Guide]], [[Everything2]], and the [[Weather Underground (weather service)|Weather Underground]]. Ann Arbor is also the site of the Michigan Information Technology Center (MITC), whose offices house [[Internet2]] and the Merit Network, a nonprofit research and education computer network.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.michitc.org/ | title=MITC: A Vision Comes to Fruition | publisher=Michigan Information Technology Center | year=2006 | accessdate=2006-06-04}}</ref> On [[July 11]], [[2006]], [[Google]] announced plans to open a 1000-employee Ann Arbor office for its [[AdWords]] program later in the year.<ref>{{cite web | author=Goodman, David N. | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/11/AR2006071100225.html | title=Google Plans to Open Facility in Michigan | year=July 11, 2006 | publisher=''The Washington Post'' | accessdate=2006-07-12}}</ref>
 
[[Pfizer]], the city's second largest employer, operates a large pharmaceutical research facility on the northeast side of Ann Arbor. On [[January 22]], [[2007]], Pfizer announced it would close operations in Ann Arbor by the end of 2008. The facility was previously operated by Warner-Lambert and, before that, Parke-Davis. The city is the home of other research and engineering centers, including those of [[General Dynamics]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA). Other research centers sited in the city are the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]'s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory and the [[Toyota|Toyota Technical Center]].

Several major companies are headquartered in Ann Arbor. The original [[Borders Books]] was opened on Ann Arbor's State Street in 1971 by brothers Tom and Louis Borders, and began operating other outlets around the region in 1985. The Borders chain is still based in the city, as is its flagship store (although not in its original location). Dogs are allowed inside the flagship store, and the cashiers have a stock of treats for such visitors.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Blakeley, Pam | year=2005-2006 | title=[http://www.ecurrent.com/ag/2005/feat/dogging05.php Doggin' Around Ann Arbor] | journal=Ann Arbor Guide 2005-6 | accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref> [[Domino's Pizza]]'s headquarters is near Ann Arbor on Domino's Farms, a 271-acre (109 hectare) [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]-inspired complex in the northeast portion of the city.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dominosfarms.com/visibility.php | title=Distinction and Visibility | publisher=Domino's Farms Office Park | year=2006 | accessdate=2006-06-04}}</ref> Flint Ink Corp., another Ann Arbor-based company, was until recently the world's largest privately held ink manufacturer (in October 2005, it was acquired by Stuttgart-based XSYS Print Solutions). Another Ann Arbor-based company is [[Zingerman's|Zingerman's Delicatessen]], which serves sandwiches and Jewish foods, and has developed businesses under a variety of brand names.

Many [[cooperatives|cooperative]] enterprises were founded in the city during the 1960s and 1970s; among those that remain are the People's Food Co-op and the [[Inter-Cooperative Council at the University of Michigan]], a student-housing cooperative. The [[North American Students of Cooperation]] (NASCO) is an association of cooperatives headquartered in Ann Arbor. There are also three [[cohousing]] communities &mdash; [[Sunward]], Great Oak, and Touchstone &mdash; located immediately to the west of the city limits.

==Education==
[[image:Annarbor um law library.jpg|thumb|Rackham School of Graduate Studies, University of Michigan]]
The [[University of Michigan]] is the dominant institution of higher learning in Ann Arbor, providing the city with a distinctly [[college town|college-town]] atmosphere.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Cochran, Jason | year=October 2002 | title=[http://www.budgettravelonline.com/bt-dyn/content/article/2005/06/04/AR2005060400887.html Ann Arbor, Michigan] | journal=Budget Travel Online | accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref> Much of the campus is adjacent to and intermixed with the city's downtown district. Because the campus and the city expanded side-by-side, there is often no firm divide between the two, with university buildings scattered through much of the city center.

Other local colleges and universities are [[Cleary University]], a private business school; [[Concordia University, Ann Arbor|Concordia University]], a Lutheran liberal-arts institution; and [[Washtenaw Community College]]. [[Ave Maria School of Law]], a Catholic institution established by [[Domino's Pizza]] cofounder [[Tom Monaghan]], opened near northeastern Ann Arbor in 2000. There were plans to establish [[Ave Maria University]] on land occupied by Domino's Farms. However, due to conflicts with local zoning authorities, the new campus is under construction near [[Naples, Florida]].

Ann Arbor is home to more than 20 private schools,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.schoolsk-12.com/Michigan/Ann-Arbor/Private-schools.html |title=Ann Arbor private schools | publisher=Schools K-12 | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref> including [[Clonlara School]] and [[Greenhills School]]. The Ann Arbor Public School District handles local public education. The system <U+2013> which enrolls 16,974 students (2005/2006 September head count) <U+2013> consists of twenty-one [[elementary school]]s, five [[middle school]]s, and five [[high school]]s (two traditional, [[Pioneer High School|Pioneer]] and [[Huron High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan|Huron]], as well as three alternative schools: [[Community High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan|Community High]], Stone School, and Roberto Clemente).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aaps.k12.mi.us/aaps.about/aaps.data0506/headcount_by_grade_and_school | title=About AAPS: Demographics Data - Headcount by Grade and School | year=2005 | publisher=Ann Arbor Public Schools | accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref> Due to overcrowding problems at the two traditional high schools, a third traditional high school, Skyline High School, is under construction and is slated to open in September 2008. The district also operates a K-8 open school program,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://aaopen.a2schools.org/ | title=Ann Arbor Open School | publisher=Ann Arbor Public Schools | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref> Ann Arbor Open, out of the former Mack School. This program is open to all families who live within the district. Ann Arbor Public Schools also operates a preschool and family center, with programs starting as early as birth for at-risk infants and other programs for at-risk children before [[kindergarten]]. The district has constructed a new preschool center to open in September 2006, with both free and tuition-based programs for preschoolers in the district.

==Culture==
{{main|Culture in Ann Arbor, Michigan}}
[[Image:AnnArborMural.jpg|thumb|Mural outside a restaurant on Liberty Street.]]
Many Ann Arbor cultural attractions and events are sponsored by the University of Michigan. Several performing arts groups and facilities are on the university's campus, as are museums dedicated to [[art]], [[archaeology]], and natural history and sciences (''see [[Museums at the University of Michigan]]''). Regional and local performing arts groups not associated with the university include the Ann Arbor Civic Theatre; the Arbor Opera Theater; the [[Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra]]; the Ann Arbor Ballet Theater; the Ann Arbor Civic Ballet (established in 1954 as Michigan's first chartered ballet company<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.arborweb.com/entindex.html | title=City Guide <U+2014> Dance | publisher=ArborWeb.com | year=2005 | accessdate=2005-08-18}}</ref>); and Performance Network, which operates a downtown theater frequently offering new or nontraditional plays.

The [[Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum]], located in a renovated and expanded historic downtown fire station, contains more than 250 interactive exhibits featuring science and technology. [[Artrain]], on North Main Street, is a traveling art museum located on a train.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.artrainusa.org/about-artrainusa.asp | title=Artrain USA: About Artrain | publisher=Artrain USA | year=2006 |accessdate=2006-06-04}}</ref> Other art galleries exist in the city, notably in the downtown area and around the University of Michigan campus. Aside from a large restaurant scene in the Main Street, South State Street, and South University Avenue areas, Ann Arbor ranks first among U.S. cities in the number of booksellers and books sold per capita.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ecurrent.com/ag/2003/shop/list.php#boo | title=Ann Arbor Guide 2003-4 | year=2003-2004 | publisher=Ecurrent.com | accessdate=2005-08-17}}</ref> The Ann Arbor District Library maintains four branch outlets in addition to its main downtown building; a fifth branch is set to open in 2008. The city is also home to the [[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library]].

Several annual events <U+2013> many of them centered on performing and visual arts <U+2013> draw visitors to Ann Arbor. One such event is the [[Ann Arbor Art Fairs]], a set of four concurrent juried fairs held on downtown streets, which began in 1960. Scheduled on Wednesday through Saturday in the third week of July, the fairs draw upward of half a million visitors.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.artfair.org/ | title=About - Mission & History | publisher=Ann Arbor Street Art Fair | year=2006 | accessdate=2007-02-20}}</ref> One event that is not related to visual and performing arts is [[Hash Bash]], held on the first Saturday of April in support of the reform of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] laws. It has been celebrated since 1971. The Naked Mile, which features students [[Streaking|running naked]] through the streets in late April to celebrate the end of the winter semester, has occurred since 1986. Beginning in 2000, however, a crackdown by university and city police, citing safety concerns, has reduced the size of the run.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.goodspeedupdate.com/naked-mile-data-4-10-03.html | title=Naked Mile Data Page | publisher=goodspeedupdate.com | year=April 2001 |accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref>

Ann Arbor has a major scene for college sports, notably at the University of Michigan, a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]]. Several well-known college sports facilities exist in the city, including [[Michigan Stadium]], the largest [[American football]] stadium in the world with a 107,501 seating capacity.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.worldstadiums.com/stadium_menu/stadium_list/100000.shtml | title=List of 100,000+ Capacity Stadiums | publisher=WorldStadiums.com | year=2006 | accessdate=2006-01-11}}</ref> The stadium is colloquially known as "The Big House." [[Crisler Arena]] and [[Yost Ice Arena]] play host to the school's basketball and ice hockey teams, respectively. [[Concordia University, Ann Arbor, Michigan|Concordia University]], a member of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]], also fields sports teams.

A person from Ann Arbor is called an "Ann Arborite," and many long-time residents call themselves "townies." The city itself is often called ''A<U+00B2>'' ("A-squared") or ''A2'' ("A two"), and, less commonly, ''Tree Town''. Recently, some youth have taken to calling Ann Arbor ''Ace Deuce'' or simply ''The Deuce''. With [[tongue-in-cheek]] reference to the city's liberal political leanings, some occasionally refer to Ann Arbor as ''The People's Republic of Ann Arbor''<ref>{{cite journal | author=Bakopoulos, Dean | title=[http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1997/apr/04-17-97/week/arts21.html Places I'll remember: A farewell to Ann Arbor] | journal=The Michigan Daily | year=April 17, 1997 | accessdate=2007-02-20}}</ref> or ''25 square miles surrounded by reality'',<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boothnewspapers.com/markets/aa.html | title=Welcome to Ann Arbor | publisher=Booth Newspapers - ''The Ann Arbor News'' | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-02-20}}</ref> the latter phrase being adapted from Wisconsin Governor Lee Dreyfus's description of Madison, Wisconsin.

[[WPXD]] channel 31, an affiliate of the [[ION Television|ION Television network]], is licensed to the city. Community Television Network (CTN) is a city-provided cable television channel with production facilities open to city residents and nonprofit organizations.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ci.ann-arbor.mi.us/ctn/ | title=Community Television Network | publisher=Ann Arbor City Government | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-02-19}}</ref> [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]]-area radio and [[television station]]s also serve Ann Arbor, and stations from Toledo and Lansing can be heard in parts of the area.

==Health and utilities==
The [[University of Michigan Health System|University of Michigan Medical Center]], the preeminent health facility in the city, took the #12 slot in the 2006 ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' for hospitals.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/health/best-hospitals/honorroll.htm | title=America's Best Hospitals 2006: Honor Roll | year=2007 | publisher=US News and World Reports | accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref> The University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) includes University Hospital, C.S. Mott Children's Hospital and Women's Hospital in its core complex. UMHS also operates out-patient clinics and facilities throughout the city. The area's other major medical centers include a large facility operated by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] in Ann Arbor, and Saint Joseph Mercy Hospital in nearby [[Superior Township, Washtenaw County, Michigan|Superior Township]].

The city provides sewage disposal and water supply services, with water coming from the [[Huron River (Michigan)|Huron River]] and groundwater sources. There are two [[Water purification|water-treatment]] plants, one main and three outlying [[dam|reservoirs]], four pump stations, and two [[water tower|elevated tanks]]. These facilities serve the city, which is divided into five water districts. The city's water department also operates four dams along the Huron River, two of which provide [[hydroelectric power]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ci.ann-arbor.mi.us/PublicServices/Water/WTP/int-treat.html | title=Water Treatment | year=2005 | publisher=City of Ann Arbor | accessdate=2005-09-07}}</ref> The city also offers waste management services, with Recycle Ann Arbor's handling recycling service. Other utilities are provided by private entities. [[Electrical power]] and gas are provided by [[DTE Energy]]. [[AT&T]], the successor to Michigan Bell, [[Ameritech]], and SBC Communications, is the primary wired telephone service provider for the area. Phone service is also available from various [[List of United States mobile phone companies|national wireless companies]]. Cable service is primarily provided by [[Comcast]].

==Transportation==
The city is belted by three [[highway]]s: [[Interstate 94|I-94]], which runs along the southern portion of the city; [[U.S. Route 23|US 23]], which primarily runs along the eastern edge of Ann Arbor; and [[M-14 (Michigan highway)|M-14]], which runs along the northern edge of the city. The streets in downtown Ann Arbor conform to a grid pattern, though this pattern is less common in the surrounding areas. Major roads branch out from the downtown district like spokes on a wheel to the highways surrounding the city. Several of the major surface arteries lead to the I-94/M-14 juncture in the west, US 23 in the east, and the city's southern areas. A large network of [[bike path]]s crisscrosses the city, as well.

[[Image:AATA Bus.JPG|thumb|An AATA bus, with the blue-roofed Blake Transit Center in the background.]]
The [[Ann Arbor Transportation Authority]] (AATA), which brands itself as "The Ride," operates public [[bus]] services throughout Ann Arbor and nearby [[Ypsilanti, Michigan|Ypsilanti]]. A separate free bus service operates within the University of Michigan campuses. Plans have been floated several times to operate a trolley service between downtown and Briarwood Mall along disused rail tracks, although these have not been implemented as of 2005. A downtown bus depot served by [[Greyhound Lines]] provides out-of-town bus service, and is the city's only remaining example of the [[Streamline Moderne]] architectural style.

[[Ann Arbor Municipal Airport]] is a small general aviation facility located south of [[Interstate 94|I-94]]. [[Detroit Metropolitan Airport]], the area's large international airport, is approximately 28&nbsp;miles (45&nbsp;km) east of the city, in [[Romulus, Michigan|Romulus]]. [[Willow Run Airport]] in nearby Ypsilanti serves freight, corporate, and general aviation clients.

The city was a major rail hub, notably for freight traffic between [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] and ports north of [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], from 1878 to 1982; however, the [[Ann Arbor Railroad]] also sold 1.1 million passenger tickets in 1913.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://clarke.cmich.edu/michrailroads/building.htm | title=Michigan's Ann Arbor Railroads <U+2014> Building the Ann Arbor | publisher=Central Michigan University <U+2014> Clarke Historical Library | year=December 8, 2005 | accessdate=2005-09-01}}</ref> The city was also served by the [[Michigan Central Railroad]] starting in 1837. [[Amtrak]] provides service to Ann Arbor, operating its [[Wolverine (passenger train)|Wolverine]] three times daily in each direction between Chicago and [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]], via [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]]. Rail service is provided at the Ann Arbor Train Station; the present-day station neighbors the city's old Michigan Central Depot, which was renovated as a restaurant in 1969. There have been plans to build a [[commuter rail]] link between Ann Arbor and Detroit, with the U.S. federal government providing [[United States dollar|$]]100 million to enable its development.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Mulcahy, John | year=August 28, 2005 | title=[http://www.mlive.com/news/aanews/index.ssf?/base/news-14/112522397069040.xml&;coll=2 Is commuter rail finally on fast track?
