'''Lee Kyung-eun''' (popularly known as '''Harisu''', in Korean hangul: <U+D558><U+B9AC><U+C218>, hanja: <U+6CB3><U+8389><U+79C0>) (born [[February 17]], [[1975]]) is a male to female [[transgender]] singer, model and actress from [[South Korea]].  Her stage name is a Korean adaptation of the phrase "hot issue".

==Biography==

Harisu was born Lee Kyung-yup in [[Seongnam]], near [[Seoul]]. In [[1997]]-[[1998|98]], she moved to [[Japan]]. While there, she had male to female [[sex reassignment surgery]] and began studying to become a hairdresser. She also began singing in Japanese clubs. It was while singing in Japan that she got her first break, being recruited by an agent in [[1999]]. In [[2001]] she adopted the stage name Harisu, just before featuring in an advertisement for Korean cosmetics company DoDo. It turned out to be a huge success and ended up launching her career.

Since then, Harisu has branched out into music and acting, among other fields. She has recorded five solo musical albums, switching between [[techno music]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. In [[2001]], she starred in the film [[Yellow Hair 2]], for which she also recorded the soundtrack. Harisu has also had brief forays into other areas <U+2014> having danced in a video clip for the group '[[Turbo (group)|Turbo]]', as well as having written a book/photoessay about herself in [[2001]].

On [[December 12]], [[2002]], the [[Inchon]] District Court recognized her as legally female, and she changed her name from Lee Kyung-yup to Lee Kyung-eun.<ref>Yoo Dong-ho.
