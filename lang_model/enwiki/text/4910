They play in the [[FAI Premier Division]], the top tier of [[FAI League of Ireland|league football]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]], and are the only participating club from Northern Ireland. They play at the [[Brandywell]] and wear red and white striped shirts. Their nickname, '''the Candystripes''', derives from their colours.<ref>[http://www.albionroad.com/clubs_details.aspx?id=210 Derry City], ''Albion Road'', [[2007]].

The club, founded in 1928, initially played in the [[Irish League]], the domestic league in Northern Ireland, and won a title in 1964&ndash;65. In 1971, security concerns related to [[Troubles|unrest in Northern Ireland]] meant matches could not be played at the Brandywell. The team played "home" fixtures 30 miles away in [[Coleraine]]. Security forces withdrew their objections to the use of the Brandywell the following year, but in the face of insistence from the Irish League that the unsustainable arrangement continue, the club withdrew from the league. After 13 years in junior football, they joined the [[League of Ireland|League of Ireland's]] new First Division for 1985&ndash;86. Derry won the First Division title and achieved promotion to the Premier Division in 1987, and have remained there since. The club went on to win a domestic [[The Treble|treble]] in 1988&ndash;89 and the Premier Division again in 1996&ndash;97.

Derry applied to join the reorganised [[Football League of Ireland]] (the league in the [[Republic of Ireland]]) in 1985 with the Brandywell as their home.

In April 1986 the club ran a competition in local schools to design a crest for them. The winning entry was designed by John Devlin, a [[St. Columb's College]] student, and was introduced on [[5 May]], [[1986]] as Derry hosted [[Nottingham Forest]] for a friendly. The crest depicted a simplified version of the city's [[Foyle Bridge]], which had opened 18 months previously, the traditional red and white stripes of the jersey bordered by thin black lines, the year in which the club were founded and a football in the centre representing the club as a footballing entity. The name of the club appeared in [[Impact (typeface)|Impact]] font.

With the novelty of the Foyle Bridge wearing off over time, the crest lasted until [[15 July]], [[1997]], when the current one was unveiled at [[Lansdowne Road]] with the meeting of Derry City and [[Celtic F.C|Celtic]] during a pre-season friendly tournament.<ref>Mahon (1998), pp. 189&ndash;192.</ref> The modern crest also features a centred football, the year of founding and the club's name in a contemporary [[sans-serif]] font &mdash; [[Industria (typeface)|Industria Solid]]. The famous red and white stripes are present along with a red mass of colour filling the left half of the crest, separated from the right by a white stripe. Known cultural landmarks or items associated with the city are absent from the [[minimalist]] design. The crests have always been positioned over the heart on the home jerseys. The current away jersey has the crest on its upper-centre.

Plans of Derry City's to purchase a pitch fell through after their formation due to the tight time-scale between their birth in 1928 and the season's beginning in 1929 and so the [[Derry City Council|Londonderry Corporation]] (now the Derry City Council) was approached for the use of the Brandywell which had been used for football up until the end of the 19th century.

Derry City's first game at the Brandywell was a 2&ndash;1 loss to [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] on [[22 August]], [[1929]].<ref name=History/> In 1933, the purchase of Bond<U+2019>s Field in the [[Waterside]] was mentioned, but it was thought to be too far away from the fan-base which had built up on the Cityside, especially in the Brandywell area. They also had first option on Derry Celtic<U+2019>s old ground, [[Celtic Park (Derry)|Celtic Park]], but hesitated on a final decision and the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] bought it ten years later. They also decided against buying Meenan Park for <U+00A3>1,500.<ref name=History/> 

Because of [[Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland's]] volatile political situation during the [[Troubles]] and security fears for [[Protestants]] and those of the [[Unionism (Ireland)|unionist]] tradition visiting the mainly [[Irish nationalist|nationalist]] city of [[Derry]], the [[Brandywell]] has not always been the home ground of Derry City. In 1970 and 1971, Derry had to play their "home" ties against [[Linfield FC|Linfield]] at [[Windsor Park]] in [[Belfast]] &mdash; the home-ground of Linfield. From September 1971 until October 1972 Derry were forced to play all their "home" games at the [[The Showgrounds (Coleraine)|Showgrounds]] in mainly Protestant [[Coleraine]], over 30&nbsp;miles away, as police ruled the [[Irish republicanism|republican]] Brandywell area as too unsafe for visiting unionists. The Brandywell did not see senior football for another 13 years as the [[Irish Football League]] upheld a ban on the stadium and Derry decided to leave the league as a result.<ref name=Bradley/> Only greyhound meetings and junior football were held during this time.<ref name=McGuinness/> Derry's admission to the [[League of Ireland]] in 1985 saw a return of senior games.

Derry City have made numerous appearances in popular culture.

The club have also featured on popular television. Due to the fact that they are a club based in [[Northern Ireland]] playing in the league of the [[Republic of Ireland]] they often receive the attention of broadcasters in both jurisdictions. In the [[BBC]] documentary series ''[[Who Do You Think You Are?]]'' shown the night before Derry's clash with [[Paris St. Germain]] in the 2006&ndash;07 [[UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup's]] First Round, it was highlighted that [[Archie McLeod]], the grandfather of [[David Tennant]], the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' actor, was a Derry City player. Derry had supplied a lucrative signing-on fee and had enticed him over from [[Scotland]].<ref>Barratt, Dr. Nick.

Derry City played in the first [[League of Ireland]] match ever to be shown live on television when they visited [[Tolka Park]] to play [[Shelbourne FC|Shelbourne]] during the 1996&ndash;97 season. The game was broadcast on [[RT<U+00C9>|RT<U+00C9>'s]] [[Network 2]] and finished 1&ndash;1 with [[Gary Beckett]] scoring for Derry.

Another medium to play host to the club has been the radio. On [[20 April]], [[2005]], Derry City featured in an audio documentary ''The Blues and the Candy Stripes'' on [[RT<U+00C9> Radio 1|RT<U+00C9> Radio 1's]] ''Documentary on One''.

The club is known for its community spirit and the supporters have played a pivotal role in the survival and successes of the club.

{{blockquote|Nobody owns Derry City F.C. apart from the people of Derry. Five or six years ago the club was on its knees, on the verge of going out of business.

People, fans, ordinary people; they went out and banged on doors to collect money, they went around pubs with collection buckets, they did what they could to keep the club alive. Derry is a close-knit place, a small community, they care about their club and that's why we still have a club.

It has seen struggle and marginalisation turn to renewal and success. The pride people have in this club reflects the pride we hold in our city. Derry City players and supporters alike are superb ambassadors for the city. Today, the club, like the city, looks to the future with great hope. For all its successes, Derry City would be nothing without the people of the city.<ref>Mahon (1998). "Foreword" by [[John Hume|Hume, John]], p. 2.</ref>}}

Support for the club is quite dependent on geography and crosses social boundaries. Fans come from both [[working class]] areas, such as the Brandywell area and [[Bogside]], and more affluent regions of the city, like [[Culmore]]. The Cityside is seen as the traditional base of the club, especially the Brandywell area, although the [[Waterside, Derry|Waterside]] is also home to a smaller number of supporters.<ref name=Cronin/> The club are supported mainly by Derry's [[Irish nationalist|nationalist]] community. The connection is rooted mainly in [[geography]], as well as [[social]], [[cultural]] and [[historical]] circumstances, as opposed to the club or its fans pushing towards the creation of a certain identity.<ref name=Cronin/> The club has a small minority of supporters of a [[Protestant]] upbringing. The city's Protestant community is largely apathetic, though some [[Unionism (Ireland)|unionists]] and [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]] damn the club as a symbol of Catholicism and nationalism.<ref name=Cronin/><ref>For a more in-depth analysis and study of [[Ethnicity and football|sectarian divisions and the politico-religious alignment of certain communities of fans to certain clubs]] within domestic Irish (especially Northern Irish) football, see: {{cite book |
