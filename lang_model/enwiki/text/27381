'''Sertraline hydrochloride''' (trade names '''Zoloft''', '''Lustral''') is an [[antidepressant]] of the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) class. It was introduced to the market by [[Pfizer]] in 1991. Sertraline is primarily used to treat [[clinical depression]] in adult [[Patient#Outpatient vs inpatient|outpatients]] as well as [[obsessive-compulsive disorder|obsessive-compulsive]], [[panic disorder|panic]] and [[social phobia|social anxiety]] disorders in both adults and children. In 2007 it was the most prescribed antidepressant on the U.S. retail market with 29,652,000 prescriptions.<ref>The sertraline prescriptions were calculated as a total of prescriptions for Zoloft and generic Sertraline using data from the charts for generic and brand name drugs, see: {{cite web | url = http://www.drugtopics.com/drugtopics/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=491181 | title = Top 200 Generic Drugs by Units in 2007| accessdate = 2008-03-30 | author = Verispan|date = 2008-02-18| format = PDF| publisher = Drug Topics}} and {{cite web | url = http://www.drugtopics.com/drugtopics/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=491207 | title = Top 200 Brand Drugs by Units in 2007| accessdate = 2008-03-30 | author = Verispan|date = 2008-02-18| format = PDF | publisher = Drug Topics}}</ref>

The efficacy of sertraline for depression is similar to that of older [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s, but its [[adverse drug reaction|side effects]] are much less pronounced. Differences with newer antidepressants are subtler and also mostly confined to side effects. Evidence suggests that sertraline may work better than [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac) for some subtypes of depression. Sertraline is highly effective for the treatment of panic disorder but is inferior to [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] when applied to obsessive-compulsive disorder. Although approved for these indications, sertraline leads to only modest improvement in social phobia or [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]. Sertraline alleviates the symptoms of [[premenstrual dysphoric disorder]] and can be used in sub-therapeutic doses or intermittently for its treatment.

Sertraline shares the common side effects and [[contraindication]]s of other SSRIs, with high rates of nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, and sexual side effects; however, it does not cause [[weight gain]], and its effects on cognition are mild. In pregnant women taking sertraline, the drug was present in significant concentrations in fetal blood, and was also associated with a higher rate of various [[congenital disorder#Congenital malformations (birth defects)|birth defect]]s. Similarly to other antidepressants, the use of sertraline for depression may be associated with a higher rate of suicidality. Due to the rarity of this side effect, [[statistical significance|statistically significant]] data are difficult to obtain, and suicidality continues to be a subject of controversy.

==History==
The history of sertraline dates back to the early 1970s, when [[Pfizer]] chemist Reinhard Sarges synthesized tametraline, a [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]. Development of tametraline was soon stopped because of undesired [[stimulant]] effects observed in animals. Several years later, biochemist Kenneth Koe and chemist Willard Welch generated tametraline derivatives and tested them ''[[in vitro]]'' for serotonin reuptake inhibition. Welch then prepared [[stereoisomerism|stereoisomers]] of the most promising candidate, which were tested ''[[in vivo]]'' by animal behavioral scientist Albert Weissman. The most active (+)-[[cis-trans isomerism|''cis''-isomer]] was taken into further development and eventually named sertraline. Weissman and Koe recalled that the group did not set up to produce an antidepressant of the SSRI type<U+2014>in that sense their inquiry was not "very goal driven", and the discovery of the sertraline molecule was serendipitous. According to Welch, they worked outside the mainstream at Pfizer, and even "did not have a formal project team". The group had to overcome initial bureaucratic reluctance to pursue sertraline development, as Pfizer was considering licensing an antidepressant candidate from another company.<ref>The most complete account has been presented in: {{cite journal |author=Mullin R |title=ACS Award for Team Innovation |journal=Chemical & Engineering News |volume=84 |issue=5 |pages=45<U+2013>52 |year=2006}}</ref><ref>A short blurb on the history of sertraline, see: {{cite journal |author=Couzin J |title=The brains behind blockbusters |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=309 |issue=5735 |pages=728 |year=2005 |pmid=16051786 |doi=10.1126/science.309.5735.728}}</ref>

During the discussion, Paul Leber, Director of the FDA Division of Neuropharmacological Drug Products, noted that granting approval was a "tough decision", since the treatment effect on [[Patient#Outpatient vs inpatient|outpatients]] with depression had been "modest to minimal".

====Depression in the elderly====
Sertraline used for the treatment of depression in elderly (older than 60) patients was superior to [[placebo]] and comparable to another SSRI fluoxetine, and TCAs amitriptyline, [[nortriptyline]] (Pamelor) and imipramine. Sertraline had much lower rates of adverse effects than these TCAs, with the exception of nausea, which occurred more frequently with sertraline.

===Panic disorder===
In four large [[Randomized controlled trial#Types of trial|double-blind]] studies sertraline was shown to be superior to [[placebo]] for the treatment of panic disorder. The response rate was independent of the dose (50<U+2013>200&nbsp;mg). In addition to decreasing the frequency of panic attacks by about 80% (vs. 45% for placebo) and decreasing general anxiety, sertraline resulted in improvement of quality of life on most parameters. The patients rated as "improved" on sertraline reported better quality of life than the ones who "improved" on placebo. The authors of the study argued that the improvement achieved with sertraline is different and of a better quality than the improvement achieved with placebo.<ref name="pmid10945134">Review: {{cite journal |author=Hirschfeld RM |title=Sertraline in the treatment of anxiety disorders |journal=Depress Anxiety |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=139<U+2013>57 |year=2000 |pmid=10945134 |doi=10.1002/1520-6394(2000)11:4&#60;139::AID-DA1&#62;3.0.CO;2-C}}</ref><ref name="pmid16292466">Meta-analysis: {{cite journal |author=Clayton AH, Stewart RS, Fayyad R, Clary CM |title=Sex differences in clinical presentation and response in panic disorder: pooled data from sertraline treatment studies |journal=Arch Womens Ment Health |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=151<U+2013>7 |year=2006 |pmid=16292466 |doi=10.1007/s00737-005-0111-y}}</ref> Sertraline was equally effective for men and women<ref name="pmid16292466"/> and for patients with or without agoraphobia.<ref name="pmid11206597">{{cite journal |author=Pollack MH, Rapaport MH, Clary CM, Mardekian J, Wolkow R |title=Sertraline treatment of panic disorder: response in patients at risk for poor outcome |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=61 |issue=12 |pages=922<U+2013>7 |year=2000 |pmid=11206597 |doi=}}</ref> Previous unsuccessful treatment with [[benzodiazepine]]s did not diminish its efficacy.<ref name="pmid11199932">{{cite journal |author=Rapaport MH, Pollack MH, Clary CM, Mardekian J, Wolkow R |title=Panic disorder and response to sertraline: the effect of previous treatment with benzodiazepines |journal=J Clin Psychopharmacol |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=104<U+2013>7 |year=2001 |pmid=11199932 |doi= |doi=10.1097/00004714-200102000-00019}}</ref> However, the response rate was lower for the patients with more severe panic.<ref name="pmid11206597"/> Double-blind comparative studies found sertraline to have the same effect on panic disorder as [[paroxetine]] (Paxil)<ref name="pmid15096081">{{cite journal |author=Bandelow B, Behnke K, Lenoir S, Hendriks GJ, Alkin T, Goebel C, Clary CM |title=Sertraline versus paroxetine in the treatment of panic disorder: an acute, double-blind noninferiority comparison |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=405<U+2013>13 |year=2004 |pmid=15096081 |doi=}}</ref> or the gold standard of panic disorder treatment [[alprazolam]] (Xanax).<ref name="pmid16053461">{{cite journal |author=Fisekovi<U+0107> S, Loga-Zec S |title=Sertraline and alprazolam in the treatment of panic desorder |journal=Bosn J Basic Med Sci |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=78<U+2013>81 |year=2005 |pmid=16053461 |doi=}}</ref> While imprecise, comparison of the results of trials of sertraline with separate trials of other anti-panic agents ([[clomipramine]] (Anafranil), [[imipramine]] (Tofranil), [[clonazepam]] (Klonopin), alprazolam, [[fluvoxamine]] (Luvox) and paroxetine) indicates approximate equivalence of these medications.<ref name="pmid10945134"/> Although panic disorder is considered to be a chronic condition, continuous treatment may not be necessary for everyone.

===Premenstrual dysphoric disorder===
According to several double-blind studies, sertraline is effective in alleviating the symptoms of [[premenstrual dysphoric disorder|PMDD]], a severe form of [[premenstrual syndrome]]. Significant improvement was observed in 50<U+2013>60% of cases treated with sertraline vs. 20<U+2013>30% of cases on placebo. The improvement began during the first week of treatment, and in addition to mood, irritability, and anxiety, improvement was reflected in better family functioning, social activity and general quality of life.

==Adverse effects==
[[Image:Zoloft bottles.jpg|thumb|right|Bottles of Zoloft as sold in the United States, with blue (50&nbsp;mg) and green (25&nbsp;mg) tablets]]
According to Pfizer, sertraline is [[contraindicated]] in individuals taking [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s or the [[antipsychotic]] [[pimozide]] (Orap). Sertraline concentrate contains alcohol, and is therefore contraindicated with [[disulfiram]] (Antabuse). The prescribing information recommends that treatment of the elderly and patients with liver impairment "must be approached with caution". Due to the slower elimination of sertraline in these groups, their exposure to sertraline may be as high as three times the average exposure for the same dose.<ref name="zoloftpi">{{cite web |url=http://www.zoloft.com |title=Zoloft Prescribing Information for the U.S.|format= PDF|publisher=Pfizer |accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref>

Among the common [[adverse drug reaction|adverse effects]] associated with sertraline and listed in the prescribing information, those with the greatest difference from [[placebo]] are [[nausea]] (25% vs. 11% for placebo), [[ejaculation]] failure (14% vs. 1% for placebo), [[insomnia]] (21% vs. 11% for placebo), [[diarrhea]] (20% vs. 10% for placebo), [[dry mouth]] (14% vs. 8% for placebo), [[somnolence]] (13% vs. 7% for placebo), [[dizziness]] (12% vs. 7% for placebo), [[tremor]] (8% vs. 2% for placebo) and decreased [[libido]] (6% vs. 1% for placebo).<ref name=zoloftpi/> Those that most often resulted in interruption of the treatment were nausea (3%), diarrhea (2%) and insomnia (2%).<ref name=zoloftpi/> Sertraline appears to be associated with [[microscopic colitis]], a rare condition of unknown [[etiology]].<ref name="pmid17100977">{{cite journal |author=Fern<U+00E1>ndez-Ba<U+00F1>ares F, Esteve M, Espin<U+00F3>s JC, Rosinach M, Forn<U+00E9> M, Salas A, Viver JM |title=Drug consumption and the risk of microscopic colitis |journal=Am.

===Sexual side effects===
Like other SSRIs, sertraline is associated with sexual side effects, including arousal disorder and difficulty achieving orgasm.  The observed frequency of sexual side effects depends greatly on whether they are reported by patients spontaneously, as in the manufacturer's trials, or actively solicited by the physicians. There have been several [[blind experiment|double-blind studies]] of sexual side effects comparing sertraline with placebo or other antidepressants.<ref name="pmid11229450">{{cite journal |author=Ferguson JM |title=The effects of antidepressants on sexual functioning in depressed patients: a review |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=62 Suppl 3 |issue= |pages=22<U+2013>34 |year=2001 |pmid=11229450 |doi=}}</ref>  While [[nefazodone]] (Serzone) and [[bupropion]] did not have negative effects on sexual functioning, 67% of men on sertraline experienced ejaculation difficulties vs. 18% before the treatment<ref name="pmid11229450"/> (or 61% vs. 0% according to another paper<ref name="pmid9448656"/>).

However, under the action of placebo the desire and satisfaction slightly improved.<ref name="pmid10363731"/>

===Suicidality===
The FDA requires all antidepressants, including sertraline, to carry a [[black box warning]] stating that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicide in persons younger than 25. This warning is based on statistical analyses conducted by two independent groups of FDA experts that found a 2-fold increase of suicidal ideation and behavior in children and adolescents, and a 1.5-fold increase of suicidality in the 18<U+2013>24 age group.<ref name=FDA>{{cite web | author = Levenson M, Holland C| title =Antidepressants and Suicidality in Adults: Statistical Evaluation.

[[Suicidal ideation]] and behavior in clinical trials are rare. For the above analysis, the FDA combined the results of 295&nbsp;trials of 11&nbsp;antidepressants for psychiatric indications in order to obtain [[statistically significant]] results. Considered separately, sertraline use in adults decreased the odds of suicidality with a marginal statistical significance by 37%<ref name =FDA3/> or 50%<ref name =FDA2/> depending on the statistical technique used. The authors of the FDA analysis note that "given the large number of comparisons made in this review, chance is a very plausible explanation for this difference".<ref name =FDA2/> The more complete data submitted later by the sertraline manufacturer Pfizer indicated increased suicidality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/06n0414/06N-0414-EC32-Attach-1.pdf |title=Memorandum from Pfizer Global Pharmaceuticals Re: DOCKET: 2006N-0414&nbsp;<U+2013>"Suicidality data from adult antidepressant trials" Background package for December 13 Advisory Committee|accessdate=2007-09-25 |author=Pfizer Inc. |date= 2006-11-30|format=PDF |work=FDA DOCKET 2006N-0414 |publisher=FDA }}</ref> Similarly, the analysis conducted by the UK [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|MHRA]] found a 50% increase of odds of suicide-related events, not reaching statistical significance, in the patients on sertraline as compared to the ones on placebo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/pl-p/documents/drugsafetymessage/con019472.pdf |title=Report of the CSM expert working group on the safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants|accessdate=2007-09-25 |date=2004-12 |format=PDF |publisher=MHRA }}</ref><ref name="pmid15718537">{{cite journal |author=Gunnell D, Saperia J, Ashby D |title=Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and suicide in adults: meta-analysis of drug company data from placebo controlled, randomised controlled trials submitted to the MHRA's safety review |journal=BMJ |volume=330 |issue=7488 |pages=385 |year=2005 |pmid=15718537 |doi=10.1136/bmj.330.7488.385 |issn= |accessdate=2007-09-25}}</ref>

===Discontinuation syndrome===
{{main|SSRI discontinuation syndrome}}
Abrupt interruption of sertraline treatment may result in [[withdrawal]] or discontinuation syndrome.

==Mechanism of action==
Sertraline is primarily a [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SRI). Therapeutic doses of sertraline (50<U+2013>200&nbsp;mg/day) taken by patients for four weeks resulted in 80<U+2013>90% inhibition of [[serotonin transporter]] (SERT) in [[striatum]] as measured by [[positron emission tomography]].

==Pharmacokinetics==
Sertraline is absorbed slowly when taken by mouth, achieving its maximal concentration in the plasma 4<U+2013>6&nbsp;hours after ingestion. In the blood, it is 98.5% [[plasma protein binding|bound to plasma proteins]]. Its half-life in the body is 13<U+2013>45&nbsp;hours and, on average, is about 1.5&nbsp;times longer in women (32&nbsp;hours) than in men (22&nbsp;hours), resulting in a 1.5-times-higher exposure of women.<ref name="pmid12452737">{{cite journal |author=DeVane CL, Liston HL, Markowitz JS |title=Clinical pharmacokinetics of sertraline |journal=Clinical Pharmacokinetics |volume=41 |issue=15 |pages=1247<U+2013>66 |year=2002 |pmid=12452737 |doi= |doi=10.2165/00003088-200241150-00002}}</ref> According to ''[[in vitro]]'' studies, sertraline is metabolized by several [[cytochrome 450]] [[isoenzyme|isoforms]]: [[CYP2D6]], [[CYP2C9]], [[CYP2B6]], [[CYP2C19]] and [[CYP3A4]], and it appeared unlikely that inhibition of any single isoform could cause clinically significant changes of sertraline pharmacokinetics.<ref name="pmid10383917">{{cite journal |author=Kobayashi K, Ishizuka T, Shimada N, Yoshimura Y, Kamijima K, Chiba K |title=Sertraline N-demethylation is catalyzed by multiple isoforms of human cytochrome P-450 in vitro |journal=Drug Metab.

==Controversy==
The brand-name form of sertraline, Zoloft, was [[direct-to-consumer advertising|advertised to consumers]] by Pfizer using the following wording: "While the cause is unknown, depression may be related to an imbalance of natural chemicals between nerve cells in the brain. Prescription Zoloft works to correct this imbalance. You just shouldn't have to feel this way anymore." An essay published in the journal ''[[PLoS Medicine]]'' noted that there is no scientific support for the "serotonin imbalance" theory of depression, and criticized Pfizer and manufacturers of other SSRIs for using it. When asked to comment on this apparent breach of federal regulations, the FDA answered that such "reductionist statements" are acceptable to explain the neurochemistry of depression "to the fraction of the public that functions at no higher than a 6th grade reading level".<ref name="PLoS">{{cite journal |author=Lacasse J, Leo J |title=Serotonin and depression: a disconnect between the advertisements and the scientific literature |journal=[[PLoS Medicine|PLoS Med]] |volume=2 |issue=12 |pages=e392 |year=2005 |pmid=16268734 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020392.g001}} [http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020392 Free full text, open-access source]</ref> However, the FDA reacted promptly with a warning letter when a Zoloft advertisement omitted information about the risk of suicidality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/warn/2005/zoloft_letter.pdf |title=Food and Drug Administration Division of Drug Marketing Advertising and Communications.

In the case of ''Regina vs Hawkins'', an Australian criminal case from the state of [[New South Wales]], Zoloft was described as an important factor in David Hawkins's killing in 1999 (through strangling) of his wife. Hawkins had been depressed, was prescribed 50&nbsp;mg of Zoloft a day and on his first day of treatment took 250&nbsp;mg. He claimed that on the night of the murder he could not sleep and was agitated, and that he had hallucinations during the attack on his wife. Several experts agreed that "Zoloft can cause agitation and a certain amount of disinhibition so that some individuals engage in aggressive or dangerous behaviours without due regard for the consequences and in a manner that is out of character for them" and that the prisoner's behavior was consistent with agitated depression further exacerbated by akathisia and toxic delirium that developed as a result of Zoloft overdose.  The court concluded that "it can be seen that the medical evidence strongly supports a conclusion that, but for the effects of the 250&nbsp;milligrams of Zoloft he had taken, it is wholly unlikely that the prisoner would have committed the crime to which he has pleaded guilty. Furthermore, it is common ground that his having done such an act is quite foreign to his former life history, his personality and psychological make up. It was also wholly inconsistent with his love for his marriage partner of nearly fifty years."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/scjudgments/2001nswsc.nsf/27602436db586906ca256983001e137a/bd5c743050325110ca256a54007de04f?opendocument | accessdate = 2007-11-03 | title = Regina v Hawkins <nowiki>[2001]</nowiki> NSWSC 420| date = 2001-05-24 | publisher = New South Wales Supreme Court}}</ref>

In 2004, a [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] nurse sued Pfizer as a [[private attorney general]] "on behalf of all California residents who have been misled about Zoloft", claiming the company covered up side effects.<ref>{{cite press release | url =http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2004_July_23/ai_n6122283 | title = Suit Claims Pfizer Conceals Evidence and Misleads Doctors and Patients About Safety and Effectiveness of Zoloft | date = 2004-07-23 | accessdate = 2007-04-19 | publisher = Business Wire/Findarticles.com}}</ref> In 2005, the Los Angeles Superior Court dismissed the case and ordered the plaintiff to pay Pfizer's cost of the suit.<ref name=lasc>Enter the case number "BC 318871" into the form to see the summary of the case stating that the suit was dismissed.
