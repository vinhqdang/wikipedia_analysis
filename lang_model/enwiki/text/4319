In [[female human anatomy]], the '''clitoral hood''' (also called '''preputium clitoridis''' and '''clitoral prepuce'''), is a fold of [[skin]] that surrounds and protects the [[clitoral glans|glans]] of the [[clitoris]]; it also covers the external shaft and develops as part of the [[labia minora]] and is [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with the [[foreskin]] (equally called ''prepuce'') in [[Sex organ|male genitals]].<ref name="Sloane">{{cite book|first= Ethel|last=Sloane | title = Biology of Women | publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2002|page=32| accessdate = August 25, 2012| isbn = 0766811425, 9780766811423 |url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kqcYyk7zlHYC&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=Helen+Connell+clitoris+1998&source=bl&ots=zHm3mmxIn1&sig=LiqbCAhXtFpVL3ID9KBMf-fpQzA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lDY5UMvVCIiFrAGbmoHgAg&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Helen%20Connell%20clitoris%201998&f=false}}</ref><ref name="Crooks">{{cite book|first=Robert |last=Crooks |first2= Karla |last2=Baur| title = Our Sexuality | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | year = 2010 | pages = 54 | accessdate = August 30, 2012 |isbn = 0495812943, 9780495812944| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=MpRnPtmdRVwC&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=The+clitoral+glans+in+particular+is+highly+sensitive&source=bl&ots=KpBrboLXy9&sig=TSArVcq-NnC4QR9PiCzeUWGzRMc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ALg_UJbrCKLW2gWp4YCgDQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=The%20clitoral%20glans%20in%20particular%20is%20highly%20sensitive&f=false}}</ref><ref name="Mulhall">{{cite book | first = John P. | last = Mulhall | editors=John P.

==Variation==

[[Image:EdSim Clitoris anatomy.jpg|thumb|left|Shows the sub-areas of the clitoris. Areas include clitoral glans, body, crura. Also shows vestibular bulbs and corpus cavernosa.]]
This is a protective hood of skin that covers the clitoral glans. There is no standard size or shape for the hood. Some women have large clitoral hoods that completely cover the clitoral glans. Some of these can be retracted to expose the clitoral glans; others do not retract. Other women have smaller hoods that do not cover the full length of the clitoral glans, leaving the clitoral glans exposed all the time. As in the male, sticky bands of tissue called ''adhesions'' can form between the hood and the glans, these stick the hood onto the glans so the hood cannot be pulled back to expose the glans, and as in the male, strongly scented [[smegma]] can accumulate.

==Stimulation==
Women with hoods covering most of the clitoris can often [[masturbate]] by stimulating the hood over the clitoral glans. Those with smaller, or more compact structures tend to rub the clitoral glans and hood together as one item. Normally, the glans clitoris itself is too sensitive to be stimulated directly, such as in cases where the hood is retracted. 

The clitoral hood also provides protection to the clitoral glans like foreskin on the penile glans. During sexual stimulation, the hood may also prevent the penis from coming into direct contact with the glans clitoris, which is usually stimulated by the pressure of the partners' pubis. Most mammals and primates approach [[copulation]] from the rear instead of the common frontal position that humans often assume, so the clitoral stimulation is directly created by glans contact with the [[scrotum]] at the base of the penis and the different contractions of its corrugated dartos muscles. The [[clitoral glans]], like the foreskin must be lubricated by the naturally provided [[sebum]]. If a woman's clitoral glans is not lubricated the hood may not caress it during sexual stimulation, or the female may experience pain rather than pleasure.

==Modifications==
{{See also|Clitoris#Modification and mutilation}}
In most of the world, clitoral modifications are uncommon. In some cultures, [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM) is practiced as a rite of passage into womanhood, is perceived as an improvement to the appearance of the genitalia, or is used to suppress or reduce female sexual desire and pleasure.<ref name="Engaging Cultural Differences: The Multicultural Challenge in Liberal Democracies">[http://books.google.com/books?id=DljvifEwf34C&pg=PA216&dq=engaging+cultural+differences+chapter+11&hl=en&ei=n3u8TqDODMHV0QGewY25BA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false Link text], "Engaging Cultural Differences: The Multicultural Challenge in Liberal Democracies," Chapter 11, Schweder, et al., 2002.</ref><ref name="Momoh">{{cite book |last=Momoh |first=Comfort |author-link=Comfort Momoh|chapter=Female Genital Mutation |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dVjIP0RfVAMC&pg=PA5 |title=Female Genital Mutilation |editor-last=Momoh |eitor-first=Comfort|pages=5<U+2013>12 |publisher=Radcliffe Publishing |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-85775-693-7|ref = harv}}</ref><ref name="Koroma 1997">{{cite web | url = http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ACT77/006/1997/en/3ed9f8e9-e984-11dd-8224-a709898295f2/act770061997en.html | title = What is Female Genital Mutilation? | date = 30 September 1997 | work = Amnesty International | page = 2 | accessdate = 25 April 2010 | last = Koroma | first = Hannah}}</ref><ref name="WHO, FGM">{{cite web|title=Female genital mutilation|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO)|year=2008/2012 |accessdate=August 22, 2012|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/index.html}}</ref> One possible modification that exists for the opposite reason is to have the hood [[Body piercing|pierced]] and insert jewellery, both for adornment and physical pleasure. Though much less common, other women opt to have their own hood surgically trimmed or removed so as to permanently expose part or all of the clitoral head. Such procedures, and FGM in general, were once performed on many children in Western countries such as the United States as well, to discourage masturbation and reduce diseases believed to relate to it, but by the 1960s this practice was recognized{{By whom|date=September 2011}} as abusive and discontinued.
