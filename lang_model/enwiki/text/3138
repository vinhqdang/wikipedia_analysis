'''Physical therapy''' (or '''physiotherapy'''), often abbreviated '''PT''', is a [[health care]] profession primarily concerned with the remediation of impairments and disabilities and the promotion of mobility, functional ability, quality of life and movement potential through examination, evaluation, diagnosis and physical intervention carried out by '''[[physical therapists]]''' (known as '''[[physiotherapists]]''' in most countries) and '''physical therapist assistants''' (known as '''physical rehabilitation therapists''' or '''physiotherapy assistants''' in some countries). In addition to clinical practice, other activities encompassed in the physical therapy profession include research, education, consultation, and administration. Definitions and licensing requirements in the [[United States]] vary among jurisdictions, as each state has enacted its own [[physical therapy practice act]] defining the profession within its jurisdiction, but the [[American Physical Therapy Association]] (APTA) has also drafted a model definition in order to limit this variation, and the APTA is also responsible for accrediting [[physical therapy education]] curricula throughout the [[United States of America]]. In many settings, physical therapy services may be provided alongside, or in conjunction with, other [[Medicine|medical]] or [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] services.

==Overview==
Physical therapy involves the interaction between therapist, patients or clients, other health care professionals, families, care givers, and communities in a process where movement potential is assessed and diagnosed and goals are agreed upon.<ref name="Description of Physical Therapy">[http://www.wcpt.org/description_of_physical_therapy Description of Physical Therapy] <U+2013> The World Confederation for Physical Therapy (WCPT)</ref> Physical therapy is performed by a therapist and sometimes services are provided by a physical therapist assistant (PTA) acting under their direction. Physical therapists and [[occupational therapists]] often work together in conjunction to provide treatment for patients. In some cases, physical rehabilitation technicians may provide physiotherapy services.<ref name ="descriptionAPTA">{{cite web|url=http://www.apta.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Consumers1&Template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&ContentID=39568|title=Discovering Physical Therapy|publisher=[[American Physical Therapy Association]]|accessdate=2008-05-29|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071031100654/http://www.apta.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Consumers1&Template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&ContentID=39568|archivedate=2007-10-31}}</ref>

PTs are healthcare professionals who diagnose and treat individuals of all ages, from newborns to the very oldest, who have medical problems or other health-related conditions, illnesses, or injuries that limit their abilities to move and perform functional activities as well as they would like in their daily lives.<ref name="Bureau of Labor Statistics">{{cite web|title=Physical Therapists|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos080.htm|publisher=US Department of Labor|accessdate=24 February 2011}}</ref> PTs use an individual's [[Medical history|history]] and [[physical examination]] to arrive at a [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] and establish a management plan and, when necessary, incorporate the results of laboratory and imaging studies. Electrodiagnostic testing (e.g., [[electromyograms]] and nerve conduction velocity testing) may also be of assistance.<ref name="evalGuidelinesAPTA">{{cite web|last=American Physical Therapy Association Section on Clinical Electrophysiology and Wound Management|url=http://www.aptasce-wm.org/documents/guidelines/ENMG%20EvaluationGuidelines.pdf|format=PDF|title=Curriculum Content Guidelines for Electrophysiologic Evaluation|publisher=American Physical Therapy Association|work=Educational Guidelines|accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref> PT management commonly includes prescription of or assistance with specific exercises, manual therapy, education, manipulation and other interventions. In addition, PTs work with individuals to prevent the loss of mobility before it occurs by developing fitness and wellness-oriented programs for healthier and more active lifestyles, providing services to individuals and populations to develop, maintain and restore maximum movement and functional ability throughout the lifespan. This includes providing services in circumstances where movement and function are threatened by aging, injury, disease or environmental factors. Functional movement is central to what it means to be [[healthy]].

Physical therapy has many specialties including [[sports]], [[wound care]], [[Electromyography|EMG]], [[cardiopulmonary]], [[geriatrics]], [[neurologic]], [[orthopaedic]] and [[pediatrics]]. PTs practice in many settings, such as [[outpatient clinic]]s or offices, health and wellness clinics, [[rehabilitation hospital]]s facilities, skilled nursing facilities, extended care facilities, private homes, education and research centers, [[schools]], [[hospices]], industrial and this workplaces or other occupational environments, [[health club|fitness centers]] and [[sports training]] facilities.<ref>{{cite web|last=American Physical Therapy Association|title=APTA Background Sheet 2008|publisher=American Physical Therapy Association|date=2008-01-17|url=http://www.apta.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Physical_Therapy&TEMPLATE=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&CONTENTID=33205|accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref>

Physical therapists also practice in non-patient care roles such as health policy,<ref>Health policy implications for patient education in physical therapy, http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3956/is_199901/ai_n8843473/</ref><ref>Initiatives in Rehabilitation Research, http://ptjournal.apta.org/cgi/content/full/86/1/141</ref><ref>Gail M.

Education qualifications vary greatly by country. The span of education ranges from some countries having little formal education to others having doctoral degrees and post doctoral residencies and fellowships.

==History of physical therapy==
{{Globalize|section|date=May 2012}}
[[File:Exercise to shoulder and elbow to increase motion following fracture and dislocation of humerous is being given by an... - NARA - 522885.tif|thumb|right|300px|Exercise to [[shoulder]] and [[elbow]] to increase motion following [[humerus fracture|fracture]] and [[shoulder dislocation|dislocation]] of [[humerus]] is being given by an Army therapist to a soldier patient.<br/>Photo by [[United States Women's Bureau]]<br/>Year: 1940<U+2013>1945<br/>Source: [[National Archives and Records Administration|NARA]] historical fund.]]
Physicians like [[Hippocrates]] and later [[Galenus]] are believed to have been the first practitioners of physical therapy, advocating [[massage]], [[manual therapy]] techniques and [[hydrotherapy]] to treat people in 460&nbsp;BC.<ref>Wharton MA. Health Care Systems I; Slippery Rock University. 1991</ref>{{Verify source|date=May 2008}} After the development of [[orthopedics]] in the eighteenth century, machines like the [[Gymnasticon]] were developed to treat [[gout]] and similar diseases by systematic exercise of the joints, similar to later developments in physical therapy.<ref>Sarah Bakewell, "Illustrations from the Wellcome Institute Library: Medical Gymnastics and the Cyriax Collection," ''Medical History'' 41 (1997), 487<U+2013>495.</ref>
The earliest documented origins of actual physical therapy as a professional group date back to [[Per Henrik Ling]], <U+201C>Father of Swedish Gymnastics,<U+201D> who founded the Royal Central Institute of Gymnastics (RCIG) in 1813 for [[massage]], [[Joint manipulation|manipulation]], and [[exercise]]. The Swedish word for physical therapist is ''sjukgymnast'' = someone involved in gymnastics for those who are ill. In 1887, PTs were given official registration by Sweden<U+2019>s National Board of Health and Welfare.
Other countries soon followed. In 1894 four nurses in Great Britain formed the [[Chartered Society of Physiotherapy]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Chartered Society of Physiotherapy|title=History of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy|publisher=Chartered Society of Physiotherapy|url=http://www.csp.org.uk/director/about/thecsp/history.cfm|accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref> The School of Physiotherapy at the University of Otago in New Zealand in 1913,<ref>{{cite web|last=Knox|first=Bruce|title=History of the School of Physiotherapy|work=School of Physiotherapy Centre for Physiotherapy Research|publisher=University of Otago|date=2007-01-29|url=http://physio.otago.ac.nz/about/history.asp|accessdate=2008-05-29|archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20071224020426/http://physio.otago.ac.nz/about/history.asp|archivedate =2007-12-24}}</ref> and the United States' 1914 [[Reed College]] in Portland, Oregon, which graduated "reconstruction aides."<ref>{{cite web|last=Reed College|title=Mission and History|work=About Reed|publisher=Reed College|url=http://www.reed.edu/about_reed/history.html|accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref>
Modern physical therapy was established in Britain towards the end of the 19th century. Soon following American orthopedic surgeons began treating children with disabilities and began employing women trained in physical education, massage, and remedial exercise. These treatments were applied and promoted further during the Polio outbreak of 1916. During the First World War women were recruited to work with and restore physical function to injured soldiers, and the field of physical therapy was institutionalized. In 1918 the term "Reconstruction Aide" was used to refer to individuals practicing physical therapy. The first school of physical therapy was established at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington, D.C., following the outbreak of World War I.<ref>http://beckerexhibits.wustl.edu/mowihsp/health/PTdevel.htm</ref>
Research catalyzed the physical therapy movement. The first physical therapy research was published in the United States in March 1921 in "The PT Review." In the same year, Mary McMillan organized the Physical Therapy Association (now called the [[American Physical Therapy Association]] (APTA). In 1924, the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation promoted the field by touting physical therapy as a treatment for [[polio]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute|title=History|work=About Us|publisher=Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute|url=http://www.rooseveltrehab.org/history.php|accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref>
Treatment through the 1940s primarily consisted of [[exercise]], massage, and [[traction (orthopedics)|traction]]. Manipulative procedures to the spine and extremity joints began to be practiced, especially in the British Commonwealth countries, in the early 1950s.<ref>{{cite book|last=McKenzie|first=R A|title=The Cervical and Thoracic Spine: Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy|place=New Zealand|publisher=Spinal Publications Ltd.|year=1998|pages=16<U+2013>20|isbn=978-0-9597746-7-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=McKenzie|first=R|title=Patient Heal Thyself|journal=Worldwide Spine & Rehabilitation|volume=2|issue=1|pages=16<U+2013>20|year=2002}}</ref> Later that decade, physical therapists started to move beyond hospital-based practice to outpatient orthopedic clinics, public schools, colleges/universities health-centres, geriatric settings (skilled nursing facilities), rehabilitation centers and medical centers.
In 1921 in the United States physical therapists formed the first professional association called the American Women's Physical Therapeutic Association. This gave birth to what is known today as the APTA (American Physical Therapy Association), and currently represents approximately 76,000 members throughout the United States. The APTA defines physical therapy as: "clinical applications in the restoration, maintenance, and promotion of optimal physical function."<ref>http://www.apta.org//AM/Template.cfm?Section=&WebsiteKey=</ref>
Specialization for physical therapy in the U.S. occurred in 1974, with the Orthopaedic Section of the APTA being formed for those physical therapists specializing in orthopaedics. In the same year, the [[International Federation of Orthopaedic Manipulative Physical Therapists]] was formed,<ref name=IFOMPT_history>{{cite web|last=Basson|first=Annalie|title=History: Abridged version of IFOMPT History|publisher=International Federation of Orthopaedic Manipulative Physical Therapists (IFOMPT)|year=2010|url=http://www.ifompt.com/About+IFOMPT/History.html|accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref> which has ever since played an important role in advancing manual therapy worldwide.

==Education==
{{Main|Physical therapy education}}
Educational criteria for physical therapy providers vary from state to state and from country to country, and among various levels of professional responsibility. Most [[U.S. state]]s have [[physical therapy practice act]]s that recognize both physical therapists (PT) and physical therapist assistants (PTA), and some jurisdictions also recognize physical therapy technicians (PT Techs) or aides.

===Physical Therapists===
The primary physical therapy practitioner is the Physical Therapist (PT), who is trained and licensed to examine, evaluate, diagnose and treat impairments, functional limitations and disabilities in patients or clients. Currently, most Physical Therapist education curricula in the United States culminate in a [[Doctor of Physical Therapy]] (DPT) degree,<ref name="2011PTed">{{cite web|url=http://www.capteonline.org/uploadedFiles/CAPTEorg/About_CAPTE/Resources/Aggregate_Program_Data/AggregateProgramData_PTPrograms.pdf|title=2010-2011 Fact Sheet: Physical Therapist Education Programs|publisher=American Physical Therapy Association|date=2011-08-16|accessdate=2012-02-28}}</ref> but many currently practicing PTs hold a [[Master of Physical Therapy]] degree and some hold a [[Bachelor's degree]]. The World Confederation of Physical Therapy (WCPT) recognizes there is considerable diversity in the social, economic, cultural, and political environments in which physical therapist education is conducted throughout the world. WCPT recommends physical therapist entry-level educational programs be based on university or university-level studies, of a minimum of four years, independently validated and accredited as being at a standard that accords graduates full statutory and professional recognition.<ref name ="descriptionAPTA" /> WCPT acknowledges there is innovation and variation in program delivery and in entry-level qualifications, including first university degrees (Bachelors/Baccalaureate/Licensed or equivalent), Masters and Doctorate entry qualifications. What is expected is that any program should deliver a curriculum that will enable physical therapists to attain the knowledge, skills, and attributes described in these guidelines. Professional education prepares physical therapists to be autonomous practitioners, that may work in collaboration with other members of the health care team.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Curricula in the United States are accredited by the [[Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education]] (CAPTE). As of 2011, APTA reports that 222 out of 227 entry-level professional degree programs accredited in the United States are at the doctoral level.<ref name="2011PTed" /> According to CAPTE, as of 2012 there are 25,660 students currently enrolled in 210 accredited [[List of Physical Therapy Schools in the United States|PT programs in the United States]].<ref name=CAPTEQuickFacts>{{cite web|url=http://www.capteonline.org/home.aspx|title=Quick Facts|publisher=Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education|year=2012|accessdate=2012-05-23}}</ref>

The physical therapist professional curriculum includes content and learning experiences in the clinical sciences (e.g., content about the cardiovascular, pulmonary, endocrine, metabolic, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, integumentary, musculoskeletal, and neuromuscular systems and the medical and surgical conditions frequently seen by physical therapists).

Curricula for the Physical Therapist professional degree include:
* Screening to determine when patients/clients need further examination or consultation by a physical therapist or referral to another health care professional.
* Examination: Examine patients/clients by obtaining a history from them and from other sources. Examine patients/clients by performing systems reviews. Examine patients/clients by selecting and administering culturally appropriate and age related tests and measures. Tests and measures include, but are not limited to, those that assess: a. Aerobic Capacity/Endurance, b. Anthropometric Characteristics, c. Arousal, Attention, and Cognition, d. Assistive and Adaptive Devices, e. Circulation (Arterial, Venous, Lymphatic), f. Cranial and Peripheral Nerve Integrity, g. Environmental, Home, and Work (Job/School/Play) Barriers, h. Ergonomics and Body Mechanics, i. Gait, Locomotion, and Balance, j. Integumentary Integrity, k. Joint Integrity and Mobility, l. Motor Function (Motor Control and Motor Learning), m. Muscle Performance (including Strength, Power, and Endurance), n. Neuromotor Development and Sensory Integration, o. Orthotic, Protective, and Supportive Devices, p. Pain, q. Posture, r. Prosthetic Requirements, s. Range of Motion (including Muscle Length), t. Reflex Integrity, u. Self-Care and Home Management (including activities of daily living [ADL] and instrumental activities of daily living [IADL]), v. Sensory Integrity, w. Ventilation and Respiration/Gas Exchange, x. Work (Job/School/Play), Community, and Leisure Integration or Reintegration (including IADL)
* Evaluation: Evaluate data from the examination (history, systems review, and tests and measures) to make clinical judgments regarding patients/clients.
* Diagnosis: Determine a diagnosis that guides future patient/client management.
* Prognosis: Determine patient/client prognoses.
* Plan of Care: Collaborate with patients/clients, family members, payers, other professionals, and other individuals to determine a plan of care that is acceptable, realistic, culturally competent, and patient-centered.
* Intervention:Provide physical therapy interventions to achieve patient/client goals and outcomes. Interventions include: a. Therapeutic Exercise, b. Functional Training in Self-Care and Home Management, c. Functional Training in Work (Job/School/Play), Community, and Leisure Integration or Reintegration, d. Manual Therapy Techniques (including Mobilization/Manipulation Thrust and Nonthrust Techniques), e. Prescription, Application, and, as Appropriate, Fabrication of Devices and Equipment, f. Airway Clearance Techniques, g. Integumentary Repair and Protection Techniques, h. Electrotherapeutic Modalities,
* Provide effective culturally competent instruction to patients/clients and others to achieve goals and outcomes.
* Prevention, Health Promotion, Fitness, and Wellness: Provide culturally competent physical therapy services for prevention, health promotion, fitness, and wellness to individuals, groups, and communities. Apply principles of prevention to defined population groups.
* Students completing a Doctor of Physical Therapy program are also required to successfully complete clinical internships prior to graduation.

====In Canada====
In the province of Quebec, prospective physical therapists are required to have completed a [[Diploma of Collegial Studies|college diploma]] in either health sciences, which lasts on average two years, or physical rehabilitation technology, which lasts at least three years, to apply to a physiotherapy program or [[athletic therapy]] program in university. Following admission, physical therapy students work on a bachelor of science with a major in physical therapy and rehabilitation. The B.Sc. usually requires three years to complete. Students must then enter graduate school to complete a master's degree in physical therapy, which normally requires one and a half to two years of study. Graduates who obtain their M.Sc. must successfully pass the membership examination to become member of the Ordre professionnel de la physioth<U+00E9>rapie du Qu<U+00E9>bec (OPPQ). Physiotherapists can pursue their education in such fields as rehabilitation sciences, sports medicine, kinesiology, and physiology.

===Physical Therapist Assistants===
Physical therapist assistants may deliver treatments and physical interventions for patients and clients under a care plan established by and under the supervision of a physical therapist. Physical therapist assistants in the United States are currently trained under [[associate degree|associate of applied sciences]] curricula specific to the profession, as outlined and accredited by CAPTE. As of August 2011, there were 276 accredited two-year ([[Associate degree]]) programs for physical therapist assistants In the United States of America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capteonline.org/uploadedFiles/CAPTEorg/About_CAPTE/Resources/Aggregate_Program_Data/AggregateProgramData_PTAPrograms.pdf|title=2010-2011 Fact Sheet: Physical Therapist Assistant Education Programs|publisher=American Physical Therapy Association|date=2011-08-25|accessdate=2012-02-28}}</ref> According to CAPTE, as of 2012 there are 10,598 students currently enrolled in 280 accredited PTA programs in the United States.<ref name=CAPTEQuickFacts />

Curricula for the physical therapist assistant associate degree include:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apta.org/PTAEducation/Overview/|title=Physical Therapist Assistant (PTA) Education Overview|publisher=American Physical Therapy Association|date=2011-03-03|accessdate=2012-02-28}}</ref>
* Anatomy & physiology
* Exercise physiology
* Human biology
* Physics
* Biomechanics
* Kinesiology
* Neuroscience
* Clinical pathology
* Behavioral sciences
* Communication
* Ethics
* Other coursework as required by individual programs.

===Physical Therapy Technicians or Aides===
Some jurisdictions allow physical therapists to employ technicians or aides to perform designated routine tasks related to physical therapy under the direct supervision of a physical therapist. Some jurisdictions require physical therapy technicians or aides to be certified, and education and certification requirements vary among jurisdictions.

====In Canada====
In the province of Quebec, physical rehabilitation technicians (also known as physical therapy technicians) are health care professionals who are required to complete a three year college diploma in physical rehabilitation technology and successfully pass the membership examinations of the Ordre professionnel de la physioth<U+00E9>rapie du Qu<U+00E9>bec (OPPQ) to practice legally.

Most physical rehabilitation technicians complete their [[Diploma of Collegial Studies|college diploma]] at [[Coll<U+00E8>ge Montmorency]], [[Dawson College]], or [[C<U+00E9>gep Marie-Victorin]], all situated in and around the [[Montreal]] area.

After completing their technical college diploma, graduates have the opportunity to pursue their studies at the university level to perhaps obtain a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[physiotherapy]], [[kinesiology]], [[Exercise Science|exercise science]], or [[occupational therapy]]. The [[Universit<U+00E9> de Montr<U+00E9>al]] and the [[Universit<U+00E9> de Sherbrooke]] are among the Qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>cois universities that admit physical rehabilitation technicians in their programs of study related to health sciences and rehabilitation in order to credit courses that were completed in [[College education in Quebec|college]].

====In the United States of America====
Job duties and education requirements for Physical Therapy Technicians or Aides may vary by employer, but education requirements range from high school diploma or equivalent to completion of a 2-year degree.<ref name=EPTech>{{cite web|url=http://education-portal.com/physical_therapy_tech.html|title=Physical Therapy Tech Career Info and Education Requirements|publisher=Education-Portal.com|year=2012|accessdate=2012-05-23}}</ref> O-Net reports that 64% of PT Aides/Techs have a high school diploma or equivalent, 21% have completed some college but hold no degree, and 10% hold an Associate's Degree.<ref name=ONETTech>{{cite web|url=http://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/31-2022.00|title=Summary Report for 31-2022.00 - Physical Therapist Aides|publisher=O-Net Online|year=2010|accessdate=2012-05-23}}</ref>

==Employment==
Physical therapy-related jobs in North America have shown rapid growth in recent years, but employment rates and average wages may vary significantly between different countries, states, provinces or regions.

===In the United States of America===
According to the [[United States Department of Labor]]'s [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], there were approximately 198,600 Physical Therapists employed in the United States in 2010, earning an average $76,310 annually, or $36.69 per hour, with 39% growth in employment projected by the year 2020.<ref name=BLSPT>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Healthcare/Physical-therapists.htm|title=Physical Therapists|work=Occupational Outlook Handbook|publisher=U.S. Dept. of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics|date=2012-04-06|accessdate=2012-05-23}}</ref> The Bureau of Labor Statistics also reports that there were approximately 114,400 Physical Therapist Assistants and Aides employed in the United States in 2010, earning an average $37,710 annually, or $18.13 per hour, with 45% growth in employment projected by the year 2020. To meet their needs, many healthcare and physical therapy facilities hire "Travel physical therapists", who work temporary assignments between 8 and 26 weeks for much higher wages; about $113,500 a year.<ref name=BLSPTA>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Healthcare/Physical-therapist-assistants-and-aides.htm|title=Physical Therapist Assistants and Aides|work=Occupational Outlook Handbook|publisher=U.S. Dept. of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics|date=2012-03-29|accessdate=2012-05-23}}</ref> Bureau of Labor Statistics data on PTAs and Techs can be difficult to decipher, due to their tendency to report data on these job fields collectively rather than separately. O-Net reports that in 2011, PTAs in the United States earned a median wage of $51,040 annually or $24.54 hourly, and Aides/Techs earned a median wage of $23,680 annually or $11.39 hourly in 2011.<ref name=ONETTech /><ref name=ONETPTA>{{cite web|url=http://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/31-2021.00|title=Summary Report for 31-2021.00 - Physical Therapist Assistants|publisher=O-Net Online|year=2012|accessdate=2012-05-23}}</ref>

==Specialty areas==

Because the body of knowledge of physical therapy is quite large, some PTs specialize in a specific clinical area. While there are many different types of physical therapy,<ref>{{cite web|last =American Physical Therapy Association|title=APTA Sections|publisher=American Physical Therapy Association|url=http://www.apta.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Chapters&Template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&CONTENTID=36890|accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref> the [[American Board of Physical Therapy Specialties]] list eight specialist certifications.  Most Physical Therapists practicing under a specialism will have undergone further training.

===Cardiovascular & pulmonary===
Cardiovascular and pulmonary rehabilitation [[respiratory practitioner]]s and physical therapists treat a wide variety of individuals with cardiopulmonary disorders or those who have had cardiac or pulmonary surgery. Primary goals of this specialty include increasing endurance and functional independence. Manual therapy is used in this field to assist in clearing lung secretions experienced with [[cystic fibrosis]]. Disorders, including [[heart attacks]], post [[coronary bypass surgery]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], and [[pulmonary fibrosis]], treatments can benefit{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} from cardiovascular and pulmonary specialized physical therapists.<ref name=Inverarity/>{{verify source|source does not support claim|date=January 2010}}

===Clinical electrophysiology===
This specialty area encompasses electrotherapy/physical agents, [[Electromyography|electrophysiological evaluation (EMG/NCV)]], physical agents, and wound management.

===Geriatric===
Geriatric physical therapy covers a wide area of issues concerning people as they go through normal adult aging but is usually focused on the older adult. There are many conditions that affect many people as they grow older and include but are not limited to the following: [[arthritis]], [[osteoporosis]], [[cancer]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], hip and joint replacement, balance disorders, [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]], etc. Geriatric physical therapists specialize in treating older adults.

===Integumentary===
[[Integumentary system|Integumentary]] (treatment of conditions involving the skin and related organs). Common conditions managed include wounds and burns. Physical therapists utilize surgical instruments, mechanical lavage, dressings and topical agents to debride necrotic tissue and promote tissue healing. Other commonly used interventions include exercise, edema control, splinting, and compression garments.

===Neurological===
Neurological physical therapy is a field focused on working with individuals who have a [[neurological disorder]] or disease. These include Alzheimer's disease, [[Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease|Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT)]], [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]], brain injury, [[cerebral palsy]],l.g.b.syndrome, [[multiple sclerosis]], [[Parkinson's disease]], spinal cord injury, and [[stroke]]. Common impairments associated with neurologic conditions include impairments of vision, balance, ambulation, [[activities of daily living]], movement, muscle strength and loss of functional independence.<ref name=Inverarity>{{cite web|last=Inverarity|first=Laura|coauthors=Grossman, K|title=Types of Physical Therapy|work=About.com|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=2007-11-28|url=http://physicaltherapy.about.com/od/typesofphysicaltherapy/a/typesofpt.htm|accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref> Physiotherapy can address many of these impairments and aid in restoring and maintaining function, slowing disease progression, and improving quality of life.

In layman's terms, neurological massage is directed toward correcting and healing out-of-normative body systems, unlike traditional massages, such as Swedish massage, that are directed toward comfort and relaxation.

===Orthopedic===
Orthopedic physical therapists diagnose, manage, and treat disorders and injuries of the [[musculoskeletal system]] including rehabilitation after orthopedic surgery. This specialty of physical therapy is most often found in the out-patient clinical setting. Orthopedic therapists are trained in the treatment of post-operative orthopedic procedures, fractures, acute sports injuries, arthritis, sprains, strains, back and neck pain, spinal conditions, and amputations.
