Although there is no known cure for [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS), several '''therapies for multiple sclerosis'''  have proven helpful. Multiple sclerosis is a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] [[demyelinating disease]] that affects the [[Central Nervous System|central nervous system]] (CNS). 

The most common initial course of the disease is the relapsing-remitting subtype, which is characterized by unpredictable attacks ([[relapse]]s) followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity. After some years, many of the people who have this subtype begin to experience neurologic decline without acute relapses as the secondary progressive subtype. Other, less common, courses of the disease are the primary progressive (decline from the beginning without attacks) and the progressive-relapsing (steady neurologic decline and superimposed attacks). Different therapies are used for patients experiencing acute attacks, for patients who have the relapsing-remitting subtype, for patients who have the progressive subtypes, for patients without a [[diagnosis]] of MS who have a [[Demyelinating disease|demyelinating]] event, and for managing the various consequences of MS. 

The primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. As with any medical treatment, medications used in the management of MS have several [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]], and many possible therapies are still under investigation. At the same time different [[Alternative medicine|alternative treatments]] are pursued by many patients, despite the paucity of supporting, comparable, replicated scientific study.

This article focuses on therapies for standard MS; [[idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating diseases|borderline forms of MS]] have particular treatments that are excluded.

== Management of acute attacks ==
[[Image:Methylprednisolone.svg|right|thumb|Chemical structure of methylprednisolone. Corticosteroids are used during acute multiple sclerosis relapses.]]

During symptomatic attacks, patients may be hospitalized. As of 2007, administration of high doses of [[intravenous therapy|intravenous]] [[corticosteroid]]s, such as [[methylprednisolone]],<ref> [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a682795.html Methylprednisolone Oral.] US National Library of Medicine (Medline) ([[2003-04-01]]).

Retrieved on [[2007-09-01]].</ref> is the routine therapy for acute relapses. This is administered over a period of three to five days, and has a well-established [[efficacy]] in promoting a better recovery from [[disability]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sellebjerg F, Barnes D, Filippini G, ''et al.'' |title=EFNS guideline on treatment of multiple sclerosis relapses: report of an EFNS task force on treatment of multiple sclerosis relapses |journal=Eur.

The aim of this kind of treatment is to end the attack sooner and leave fewer lasting deficits in the patient. Although generally effective in the short term for relieving [[symptom]]s, corticosteroid treatments do not appear to have a significant impact on long-term recovery: steroids produce a rapid improvement from disability, but this improvement only lasts up to thirty days following a clinical attack and is not evident thirty-six months after the attack. This treatment does not reduce the number of patients who subsequently develop a clinical [[relapse]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brusaferri F, Candelise L |title=Steroids for multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials |journal=J.

Recent studies suggest that steroids administered orally are just as effective at treating MS symptoms as intravenous treatment. However, short term treatment with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids does not seem to be attended by [[adverse drug reaction|adverse effect]]s; on the contrary, [[gastrointestinal]] symptoms and psychiatric disorders are more common with oral corticosteroids.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Filippini G, Brusaferri F, Sibley WA, ''et al.'' |title=Corticosteroids or ACTH for acute exacerbations in multiple sclerosis |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD001331 |year=2000 |pmid=11034713 |doi=}}</ref>

==Disease-modifying treatments==
===Clinically isolated syndrome===
The earliest clinical presentation of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is the clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). During a CIS, there is a subacute attack suggestive of [[demyelination]] but the patient does not fulfill the [[McDonald criteria|criteria]] for diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.<ref name="pmid15847841">{{cite journal |author=Miller D, Barkhof F, Montalban X, Thompson A, Filippi M |title=Clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of multiple sclerosis, part I: natural history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prognosis |journal=Lancet neurology |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=281<U+2013>8 |year=2005 |pmid=15847841 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(05)70071-5}}</ref> Several studies have shown that treatment with [[interferon]]s during an initial attack can decrease the chance that a patient will develop MS.

===Relapsing-remitting MS===
[[Image:Injection 23.JPG|left|thumb|Disease-modifying treatments are expensive and require frequent injections.]]

As of 2007, six disease-modifying treatments have been approved by regulatory agencies of different countries, including the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMEA) and the Japanese [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|PMDA]]. Three are [[interferon]]s: two formulations of [[interferon beta-1a]] (trade names ''Avonex'' and ''Rebif''; the first given weekly, the latter three times a week),<ref name="interferon beta-1a intramuscular"> [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a693040.html Interferon beta-1a Intramuscular Injection.] US National Library of Medicine (Medline) ([[2006-04-01]]).

The fifth medication, [[mitoxantrone]], is an [[immunosuppressant]] also used in [[chemotherapy|cancer chemotherapy]]. Finally, the sixth is [[natalizumab]] (marketed as ''Tysabri''), a [[Monoclonal antibody therapy|monoclonal antibody]].<ref name="natalizumab"> [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a605006.html Natalizumab Injection.] US National Library of Medicine (Medline) ([[2006-10-01]]). Retrieved on [[2007-09-02]].</ref> 

All six medications are modestly effective at decreasing the number of attacks and slowing progression to disability, although they differ in their efficacy rate. Comparisons between immunomodulators (all but mitoxantrone) show that the most effective is natalizumab, but studies of its long-term effects are still lacking.<ref name="pmid17350652">{{cite journal |author=Johnson KP |title=Control of multiple sclerosis relapses with immunomodulating agents |journal=J.

Mitoxantrone is intravenously administered every three months as a slow [[Intravenous therapy|infusion]] over at least thirty minutes.

Even with appropriate use of medication, most patients with relapsing-remitting MS still suffer from some attacks and subsequent disability.

=== Progressive MS ===
[[Image:Mitoxantrone skeletal.svg|right|thumb|Chemical structure of mitoxantrone. In 2007 it was the only approved treatment for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.]]

Treatment of progressive MS is more difficult than relapsing-remitting MS, and many patients do not respond to any available therapy. A wide range of medications have been used to try to slow the progression of the disease.  

[[Mitoxantrone]] has shown positive effects in patients with a secondary progressive and progressive relapsing courses. It is moderately effective in reducing the progression of the disease and the frequency of relapses in patients in short-term follow-up.<ref name="pmid16235298">{{cite journal |author=Martinelli Boneschi F, Rovaris M, Capra R, Comi G |title=Mitoxantrone for multiple sclerosis |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD002127 |year=2005 |pmid=16235298 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002127.pub2}}</ref> In 2007 it was the only medication approved for secondary progressive and progressive relapsing multiple sclerosis; however, it causes dose-dependent [[cardiotoxicity|cardiac toxicity]] which limits its long-term use. Interferon-beta-1b slowed progression of the disease in one clinical trial for secondary progressive MS, but not in another. However, both studies demonstrated that interferon recipients had fewer relapses and less disease activity, as assessed by [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI). Therefore, interferons show promise in treating secondary progressive MS, but more data is needed to support their widespread use.<ref name="pmid15182221">{{cite journal |author=McCormack PL, Scott LJ |title=Interferon-beta-1b: a review of its use in relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis |journal=CNS drugs |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=521<U+2013>46 |year=2004 |pmid=15182221 |doi=}}</ref>

Several trials have been designed specifically for primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS), including trials with [[interferon]]s and [[mitoxantrone]], a phase III trial of [[glatiramer acetate]], and an open-label study of [[riluzole]].<ref> [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a696013.html Riluzole.] US National Library of Medicine (Medline) ([[2003-04-01]]).

===Side effects of treatments===
Both the [[interferon]]s and [[glatiramer acetate]] are available only in injectable forms, and both can cause irritation at the injection site. 

[[Interferon]]s are produced in the body during illnesses such as [[influenza]] in order to help fight the infection.<ref name="pmid17131933">{{cite journal |author=Sl<U+00E1>dkov<U+00E1> T, Kostolansk<U+00FD> F |title=The role of cytokines in the immune response to influenza A virus infection |journal=Acta Virol. |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=151<U+2013>62 |year=2006 |pmid=17131933 |doi=}}</ref> They are responsible for the [[fever]], [[myalgia|muscle aches]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], and [[headache]] common during influenza infections.

[[Glatiramer acetate]] is generally considered to be better tolerated than the interferons, although some patients taking glatiramer experience a post-injection reaction manifested by flushing, chest tightness, heart [[palpitation]]s, breathlessness, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes.<ref name="pmid14974077">{{cite journal |author=Munari L, Lovati R, Boiko A |title=Therapy with glatiramer acetate for multiple sclerosis |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD004678 |year=2004 |pmid=14974077 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004678}}</ref>

[[Mitoxantrone]] therapy may be associated with immunosuppressive effects and [[hepatotoxicity|liver damage]]; however its most dangerous side effect is its dose-related [[cardiotoxicity|cardiac toxicity]]. Careful adherence to the administration and monitoring [[guideline (medical)|guidelines]] is therefore essential; this includes obtaining an [[echocardiogram]] and a [[complete blood count]] before treatment to decide whether the therapy is suitable for the patient or the risks are too great. It is recommended that mitoxantrone be discontinued at the first signs of heart damage, [[infection]] or liver dysfunction during therapy.<ref name="pmid16750460">{{cite journal |author=Fox EJ |title=Management of worsening multiple sclerosis with mitoxantrone: a review |journal=Clinical therapeutics |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=461<U+2013>74 |year=2006 |pmid=16750460 |doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2006.04.013}}</ref>

In [[clinical trial|phase III studies]], [[natalizumab]] was highly effective and well tolerated; however, three cases of [[progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]] (PML) were identified in patients who had taken it in combination with interferons.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kleinschmidt-DeMasters BK, Tyler KL |title=Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy complicating treatment with natalizumab and interferon beta-1a for multiple sclerosis |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine|N Engl J Med]] |volume=353 |issue=4 |pages=369<U+2013>74 |year=2005 |pmid=15947079 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa051782}} [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/353/4/369 Free full text with registration]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Langer-Gould A, Atlas SW, Green AJ, Bollen AW, Pelletier D |title=Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in a patient treated with natalizumab |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=353 |issue=4 |pages=375<U+2013>81 |year=2005 |pmid=15947078 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa051847}} [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/353/4/375 Free full text with registration]</ref> PML is a rare and progressive [[demyelinating]] disease of the [[brain]] that typically causes permanent disability or death.

There are no known treatments for PML; but the sooner the [[immune system]] returns to normal the higher the probabilities for recovery will be. As natalizumab was the suspected cause for these three cases of PML, it was withdrawn from the markets. An intensive safety evaluation was conducted which concluded that there was a potential risk of PML in patients taking natalizumab in combination with interferons. In 2006, natalizumab was finally re-approved as a monotherapy for patients with relapsing forms of MS.<ref name="pmid17434098">{{cite journal |author=Kappos L, Bates D, Hartung HP, ''et al.'' |title=Natalizumab treatment for multiple sclerosis: recommendations for patient selection and monitoring |journal=Lancet neurology |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=431<U+2013>41 |year=2007 |pmid=17434098 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(07)70078-9}}</ref>

== Management of the effects of MS ==
Disease-modifying treatments only reduce the progression rate of the disease but do not stop it. As multiple sclerosis progresses, the symptomatology tends to increase; the disease is associated with a variety of symptoms and functional deficits that result in a range of progressive impairments and [[Disability|handicap]]. Management of these deficits is therefore very important. 

Both drug therapy and [[neurorehabilitation]] have shown to ease the burden of some symptoms, even though neither influences disease progression. For other symptoms the efficacy of treatments is still very limited.<ref name="pmid16168933">{{cite journal |author=Kesselring J, Beer S |title=Symptomatic therapy and neurorehabilitation in multiple sclerosis |journal=Lancet neurology |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=643<U+2013>52 |year=2005 |pmid=16168933 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(05)70193-9}}</ref>

===Medical treatments for symptoms===
{{Further|[[Multiple sclerosis signs and symptoms]]}}
Multiple sclerosis can cause a variety of symptoms including changes in sensation ([[hypoesthesia]]), muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, difficulty to move, difficulties with coordination and balance, problems in speech (known as [[dysarthria]]) or swallowing ([[dysphagia]]), visual problems ([[nystagmus]], [[optic neuritis]], or [[diplopia]]), [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and acute or chronic [[pain]] syndromes, [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] and [[bowel]] difficulties, cognitive impairment, or emotional symptomatology (mainly [[clinical depression|depression]]). The main clinical measure of disability progression and severity of the symptoms is the [[Expanded Disability Status Scale]] or EDSS.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kurtzke JF |title=Rating neurologic impairment in multiple sclerosis: an expanded disability status scale (EDSS) |journal=Neurology |volume=33 |issue=11 |pages=1444<U+2013>52 |year=1983 |pmid=6685237 |doi=}}</ref> At the same time for each symptom there are different treatment options.

*'''Dysphagia and dysarthria''': [[dysphagia]] is a difficulty with swallowing which may cause [[choking]] and [[pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]] of food or liquid into the [[lung]]s, while [[dysarthria]] is a [[neurological]] motor [[speech disorder]] characterized by poor control over the subsystems and muscles responsible for [[speech communication|speech]] ("articulation").

== Therapies under investigation ==
{{Main|Therapies under investigation for multiple sclerosis}}

Scientists continue their extensive efforts to create new and better therapies for MS. There are a number of treatments under investigation that may curtail attacks or improve function. Some of these treatments involve the combination of drugs that are already in use for multiple sclerosis, such as the combination of [[mitoxantrone]] and [[glatiramer acetate]] (''Copaxone'').<ref> [http://www.mxga-mstrial.co.uk United Kingdom early Mitoxantrone Copaxone trial.] Onyx Healthcare ([[2006-01-01]]).

==Alternative treatments==
[[Image:Cannabis sativa.jpg|right|thumb|Many patients use medical marijuana as an alternative treatment to help them alleviate some symptoms.]]
Different alternative treatments are pursued by many patients, despite the paucity of supporting, comparable, replicated scientific study.

Clinical and experimental data suggest that certain [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]] regimens, particularly those including [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s, and [[vitamin]]s might improve outcomes in people with multiple sclerosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schreibelt G, Musters RJ, Reijerkerk A, ''et al.'' |title=Lipoic acid affects cellular migration into the central nervous system and stabilizes blood-brain barrier integrity |journal=J.

[[Herbal medicine]] is another source of alternative treatments. Many patients use medical [[marijuana]] to help alleviate symptoms; however, the results of experimental studies are scarce. At least one subgroup experiencing greater disability appears to have derived some symptomatic benefit.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chong MS, Wolff K, Wise K, Tanton C, Winstock A, Silber E |title=Cannabis use in patients with multiple sclerosis |journal=Mult.
