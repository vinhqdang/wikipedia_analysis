The '''National Flag of Canada''', popularly known as the '''Maple Leaf''' and '''l'Unifoli<U+00E9>''' ([[French language|French]] for "the one-leafed"), is a base red [[flag]] with a white square in its centre featuring a stylized, 11-pointed, red [[maple leaf]]. Before this flag, [[Canada]] used variants of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Canadian Red Ensign|Red Ensign]] with the shield of Canada charged in the fly. The Red Ensign that took familiar shape in Canada was introduced by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]] after the [[World War I|First World War]]. From the 1940s until 1965, Canada attempted to create its own flag by holding national contests, but the Red Ensign still flew for Canada. A serious [[Great Flag Debate|debate about a flag change]] did not occur until 1964, when a committee was picked by Prime Minister [[Lester B. Pearson]]. Out of three choices, the maple leaf design by [[George Stanley|George F.G. Stanley]] was chosen as the winner. The flag made its first appearance on [[February 15]], [[1965]], which is now celebrated annually as [[National Flag of Canada Day|Flag Day]].<ref name="flagfest" />

In addition to the Maple Leaf flag, other flags have been created to be used by Canadian officials, government bodies, and military forces. Most of these flags contain the Maple Leaf motif in some fashion; either by having the Canadian flag charged in the canton or by inclusion of maple leaves in the design. The [[Union Flag|Royal Union Flag]] is also an official flag in Canada and Britain, used as a symbol of Canada's membership in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and of her allegiance to the Crown. The Royal Union Flag forms a component of the flags of several [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-25|url=http://fraser.cc/FlagsCan/Nation/Union.html|title=The Royal Union Flag |publisher=Fraser|author=Fraser, Alistair B. }}</ref> In [[Quebec]], the [[Flag of Quebec|provincial flag]] (a blue cross with four [[fleurs-de-lis]]) is often considered a national flag along with the Maple Leaf flag, as is the [[Acadian]] flag in the Acadian regions of the [[Maritime provinces]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-25|url=http://www.canlii.org/qc/laws/sta/d-12.1/20040901/whole.html|title=Flag and emblems of Qu<U+00E9>bec, An Act respecting the, R.S.Q.

The current flag of Canada was approved by the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] on [[December 15]], [[1964]], and by the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] two days later. The flag was later approved by [[Monarch|Queen]] [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]], the [[Canadian monarchy|Queen of Canada]], an order which took effect on [[February 15]], [[1965]].<ref name="birth">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-25|url=http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/df3_e.cfm |title=Birth of the Canadian flag |publisher=[[Department of Canadian Heritage]] }}</ref> The national flag is also employed as the ensign for Canadian merchant ships and naval vessels.<ref name="birth" />

In 1921, King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] proclaimed the official colours of Canada as red, from [[Saint George's Cross]], and white, from the [[France|French]] royal emblem since King [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]].<ref name="birth" />

As early as 1700, the maple leaf served as a symbol celebrating the nature and environment of what is now Canada. The number of points on the leaf has no significance; they do not, for instance, represent the ten provinces plus one point for the territories such as the Australian [[Commonwealth Star]] denotes. In fact, some of the very first Canadian flags made had maple leaves of variously 13 and 15 points or more. Earlier official designs of the maple leaf on the Red Ensign and elsewhere had more than 30 points and a short stem when shown alone, similar to the popularized Vintage Canadian maple leaf.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-25|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/2002GamesGalleryFeb19/wh5.html|title=Canoe 2002 Games |publisher=Canoe 2002 Games }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-25|url=http://flagspot.net/flags/ca_misc.html#vintage|title=Republic of Western Canada |publisher=Flags of the World|date=2007-12-02|author=Nelson, Phil }}</ref> The points of the maple leaf were determined by taking various designs and putting them in a wind tunnel to see what looks the best while moving.<ref>{{cite book|title= Canada's Flag. |author=Matheson, Col.

The length of the flag is twice the width of the flag. The white field is a [[Canadian pale]] (a square central band in a vertical triband flag, named after this flag), and each bordering red field is exactly half its size.<ref name="colours" />

The Royal Union Flag, called the [[Union Flag]] (or, commonly, Union Jack) in the [[United Kingdom]], was used as a ''de jure'' flag until the adoption of the current flag in 1965. It remains an official Canadian flag, being flown on certain specific occasions.<ref name="royal union" />

Currently, regulations require federal installations to fly the Union Flag beside the Maple Leaf where physical arrangements exist (i.e., a second flagpole) on the following days: [[Commonwealth Day]] (the second Monday in March) , [[Victoria Day]] (which is also the Sovereign's official birthday in Canada) , and the anniversary of the [[Statute of Westminster]] ([[December 11]]). The Union Flag can also be flown at the National War Memorial or at other locations during ceremonies that honour Canadian involvement with forces of other Commonwealth nations during times of war. The Maple Leaf Flag always precedes the Union Flag, the former occupying the place of honour.<ref name="royal union" />

The Union Flag is also part of the provincial [[flag of Ontario|flags of Ontario]] and [[Flag of Manitoba|Manitoba]], forming the canton of these flags. A modified version is used on the [[flag of British Columbia]]. The [[flag of Newfoundland and Labrador]] is a stylized version of the Union Jack.<ref name="royal union" />

Several of the provincial [[lieutenant-governor]]s formerly used a modified Union Flag as their personal standard, but the [[Lieutenant-Governors of Nova Scotia|Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia]] is the only one who retains this design.<ref name="royal union">{{cite web| date = 2003-01-01| url =http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/etiquette/4_e.cfm| title = The Royal Union Flag| publisher =Canadian Heritage| accessdate=2006-05-20}}</ref>

The Union Flag and Canadian Red Ensign are still sometimes flown in Canada by veterans' groups and others who continue to stress the importance of Canada's British heritage and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] connection.<ref name="royal union" />

In 1963, the minority [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government of [[Lester B. Pearson]] gained power, and decided to adopt an official Canadian flag, through parliamentary debate. The idea of an official national flag had been discussed for decades in the 20th century, particularly during the Liberal governments of [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]]; indeed, during the [[World War II|Second World War]] there was for a time an effort to create a national flag for Canadian troops to carry into battle. But it was not until the 1960s that the debate intensified and became a subject of considerable controversy culminating in the [[Great Flag Debate]] of 1964. The principal political proponent of the change was [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] Lester Pearson. Pearson had been a significant broker during the Suez Crisis of 1956 (for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize). Pearson was disturbed when the Egyptian government objected to Canadian peacekeeping forces on the grounds that the Canadian flag (the Red Ensign) contained the flag (Union Jack) of the United Kingdom, one of the belligerents. According to ''Mike: The Memoirs of the Right Honourable Lester B. Pearson'', Pearson's principal concern was for the Canadian flag to be distinctive and unmistakably Canadian. The main opponent to changing the flag was the [[Leader of the Opposition (Canada)|leader of the opposition]] and former prime minister, [[John Diefenbaker]], who eventually made the subject a personal crusade.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-31|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/language_culture/topics/80/|title=The Great Canadian Flag Debate |publisher=[[CBC]] }}</ref>

Pearson was leader on a minority Government and risked losing power over the issue; however, Pearson knew the Red Ensign with the Union Jack was unpopular in Quebec, a Liberal base of support. The Red Ensign was strongly favoured by rural English Canada, the heart of [[Tory]] support. On [[May 27]], [[1964]], Pearson's minority Liberal government introduced a motion to Parliament for adoption of his personal favourite design of a  "sea to sea"  (Canada's motto) flag with blue borders and three conjoined red maple leaves on a white field. This motion led to weeks of acrimonious debate in Parliament, and the design came to be known as the ''Pearson Pennant''. Diefenbaker demanded a referendum be held on the flag issue, but Pearson instead formed a 15-member multi-party parliamentary committee to select a new design. Through a period of study with political manoeuvring, the committee chose the current design, which was created by [[George Stanley|George F.G. Stanley]], inspired by the flag of the [[Royal Military College of Canada]], in [[Kingston, Ontario]]. The ultimately favoured design with red bars and a single maple leaf was voted unanimously by the committee on [[October 29]], [[1964]]. The new flag was passed by a majority vote in the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] on [[December 15]], [[1964]]. The [[Canadian Senate|Senate]] added its approval two days later.{{fact|date=March 2008}}

[[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] proclaimed the new flag on [[January 28]], [[1965]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-25|url=http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/df3_e.cfm|title=Birth of the Canadian flag |publisher=[[Department of Canadian Heritage]] }}</ref> It was inaugurated on [[February 15]], [[1965]], at an official ceremony held on [[Parliament Hill]] in Ottawa in the presence of [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] Major-General [[Georges P. Vanier]], the [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]], the members of the Cabinet, and Canadian parliamentarians. Since 1996, [[February 15]] has been commemorated as [[National Flag of Canada Day]].<ref name=flagfest>{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/df1_e.cfm|title=The National Flag of Canada; A symbol of Canadian Identity|publisher=[[Department of Canadian Heritage]]|accessdate=2007-02-15}}</ref>

The Canadian Red Ensign, bearing the Union Jack and the shield of the royal arms of Canada, was lowered at the stroke of noon, and the new maple leaf flag was raised. The crowd sang the "[[O Canada]]" followed by the royal anthem, "[[God Save the Queen]]".<ref name=flagfest />

[[Maurice Bourget]], Speaker of the Senate, said "The flag is the symbol of the nation's unity, for it, beyond any doubt, represents all the citizens of Canada without distinction of race, language, belief or opinion.<ref name=flagfest />

Despite the preceding acrimony, the new flag was quickly embraced by the Canadian public, and internationally the flag quickly became a welcome and easily recognizable marker of Canada worldwide.{{fact|date=March 2008}}

Attachment to the old Canadian Red Ensign persisted for quite a while for many people, especially veterans. In 1967 the Canadian government first used the Canadian coat of arms (whose shield was used on the red ensign) on a red flag for the nation's centennial celebrations.<ref>{{cite web| date = 2004-01-01| url =http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ca_coa.html| title = Canadian Coat-of-Arms flag| publisher =CRW Flags Inc.| accessdate=2006-12-22}}</ref> It was designed to appeal to those who were used to the Red Ensign and had not yet become accustomed to the Maple Leaf Flag. The Canadian Red Ensign itself can be frequently seen today across Canada, usually in connection to veteran's associations.{{fact|date=March 2008}}

Occasionally, the Pearson Pennant itself can still be seen as a Canadian cultural marker. Most notably, in the 1990s [[Martin Tielli]] of the Canadian rock band [[Rheostatics]] often played a [[double neck guitar]] with a modified Pearson pennant painted on it. This guitar is pictured on the cover of the band's album ''[[Double Live (Rheostatics album)|Double Live]]''.{{fact|date=March 2008}}

=== Fate of the first Maple Leaf Flag ===

The first Maple Leaf flag was sewn by Joan O'Malley in November 1964.<ref>{{cite web| date = 2004-01-01| url =http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/df4_e.cfm| title = The Making of the Canadian flag| publisher =[[Department of Canadian Heritage]]|accessdate=2006-12-22}}</ref> After this flag was first raised in February 1965, it was said that Prime Minister Pearson gave it to the Liberal caucus. On [[February 15]] [[2000]], a ceremony was held in which the Chair of the National Liberal Caucus presented [[Sheila Copps]], then [[Minister of Canadian Heritage]], with that flag.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-25|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/language_culture/clips/80-307/|title=First flag emerges from hiding |publisher=[[CBC]] }}</ref> However, what is also said to be the first Maple Leaf Flag was discovered in 2005. That Maple Leaf Flag had been given to then [[Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons|Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons]], [[Lucien Lamoureux]]. Mr. Lamoureux was later appointed as Canada's [[ambassador]] to [[Belgium]]. After his death and a period of delay, the flag was returned to Canada.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-25|url=http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2006/02/15/maple-leaf-display.html|title=Original Maple Leaf goes on display |publisher=[[CBC]]|date=2006-02-15 }}</ref>

== Protocol ==

Officially, there is no law that dictates the proper use of the Canadian flag. However, [[Canadian Heritage]] released guidelines on how to correctly display the flag alone or with other flags. The guidelines deal with the order of precedence the Canadian flag is placed, where the flag can be used and how it is used and what people should do to honour the flag. The suggestions, titled ''Flag Etiquette in Canada,'' were published by Canadian Heritage in a book and online format, which had a last update at April of 2003.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-25|url=http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/etiquette/2_e.cfm|title=Rules for Flying the Flag |publisher=[[Department of Canadian Heritage]]|date=2003-04-01 }}</ref>

Canada follows guidelines set forth by the United Nations. With the weather permitting, the flag itself can be displayed on any day at buildings operated by the Canadian government, airports, military bases and diplomatic offices, as well as by citizens, during any time of the day. When flying the flag, it must be flown using its own pole and must not be inferior to other flags, save for, in descending order, the [[Queen's Personal Canadian Flag|Queen's Personal Standard]], the [[Flag of the Governor General of Canada|Governor General's Standard]], any of the Personal Standards of members of the [[Canadian monarchy#Canadian Royal Family|Canadian Royal Family]], or flags of the [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governors]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-25|url=http://www.saskd.ca/heritage.pdf|title=The Honours, Flags and Heritage Structure of the Canadian Forces |publisher=[[Department of National Defence (Canada)]] }}</ref>

When a flag is placed at the [[Half-staff|half-mast]] (or half-staff) position, it indicates [[mourning]]. To raise a flag in this position, the flag must be flown to the top of the pole first, then brought down halfway before the flag is secured for flying. When such mourning occurs, all flags should be flown at that position or not be flown at all, with the exception of flags permanently attached to poles.

In Canada, the decision to fly the flag at half-mast on federal buildings rests with Canadian Heritage. For the flag to be half-masted nationwide, one of the following deaths must be announced:
* The [[Canadian monarchy|Canadian monarch]] <U+2013> from the time of announcement of the death up to and including the [[funeral]]. This clause includes members of the Royal Family related to the Sovereign by the first degree, such as a spouse, children, parents or siblings.
* The current or former [[Governor General of Canada]] 
* The current or former [[Prime Minister of Canada]]
* A current minister of the federal cabinet

Each province can make its own determination of when to half-mast the flag when provincial leaders or honoured citizens pass away. Canadian Heritage has the right to half-mast the flag under extraordinary circumstances, such as honouring former American President [[Ronald Reagan]] or for international events as the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001. 

There are certain days every year that will call for the national flag to be flown at half-mast. These include:

* [[April 9]] - [[Vimy Ridge Day]]
* [[April 28]] - [[National Day of Mourning (Canada)|National Day of Mourning]]
* Last Sunday in September -  Police and Peace Officers' National Memorial Day
* [[November 11]] - [[Remembrance Day]]
* [[December 6]] - [[National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women]]

A controversy surfaced in April 2006 when the newly-elected [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] government discontinued the practice, initiated by the previous [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government, of flying the flag at half-mast on all government buildings whenever a Canadian soldier was killed in action in [[Canada's role in the invasion of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-25|url=http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2006/04/24/flag060424.html|title=Peace Tower flag will not be lowered for military deaths |publisher=[[CBC]]|date=2006-04-24 }}</ref> The policy of half-masting upon every death had been initiated after the [[Tarnak Farm incident]].

The issue divided veterans' groups and military families, some of whom supported the return to the original tradition of using Remembrance Day to honour all soldiers killed in action, while others who felt that it was an appropriate way to honour the fallen and to remind the population of the costs of war.

In spite of the federal government's policy, local authorities have often decided to half-mast the national flag since then to honour fallen soldiers who were from their jurisdiction. Examples include [[Toronto]] and [[Saskatchewan]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-25|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/saskatchewan/story/2006/08/08/flags-sask.html|title=Sask. flags at half-mast for fallen soldier |publisher=[[CBC]]|date=2006-08-09 }}</ref>

== Government promotion ==
Ever since the adoption of the Canadian flag in 1965, there have been programs sponsored by the Canadian government to promote the flag to their citizens and to the world at large. Two of the most famous examples is the Heritage Department's Parliamentary Flag Program and the flag program run by the [[Public Works and Government Services Canada|Department of Public Works]]. The flag has also been featured on [[definitive stamp]] series issued by [[Canada Post]] since 1989.<ref name="stamps">{{cite web| date = 2006-01-01| url =http://members.shaw.ca/kcic1/flagstamps.html| title = First Class Rate - Definitives (1989&ndash;2003)| publisher =Knight's Canadian Info Collection| accessdate=2006-12-22}}</ref>
This increased exposure of the Canadian flag and the flag as part of the Canadian identity at home and abroad through the circulation of postage stamps.<ref name="stamps" />

To increase awareness of the new flag, the Parliamentary Flag Program was set up in December 1972 by the Cabinet. The purpose of this program was to allow members of the [[Canadian House of Commons]] to distribute flags and lapel pins in the shape of the Canadian flag to their constituents. The program has been in operation since 1973.<ref>{{cite web| date = 2003-01-01| url =http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/mission/11_e.cfm| title = Administration of the Parliamentary Flag Program| publisher =[[Department of Canadian Heritage]]| accessdate=2006-05-20}}</ref>

Flags that are flown from the [[Peace Tower]], the East and West blocks of [[Parliament Hill]] are packaged by the Department of Public Works and can be obtained free of charge. However, the program has a waiting list that lasts about 11 years for East and West block flag and an 20-year waiting list for a Peace Tower flag.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-25|url=http://www.parliamenthill.gc.ca/text/faq_e.html|title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=[[Government of Canada]] }}</ref>

In 1996, [[Sheila Copps]], as the Minister of [[Canadian Heritage]] instituted the "One in a Million National Flag" Challenge.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-25|url=http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/newsroom/index_e.cfm?fuseaction=displayDocument&DocIDCd=6NR032|title=Heritage Minister Sheila Copps Launches "One In A Million National Flag" Campaign |publisher=[[Department of Canadian Heritage]]|date=1996-02-19|author=Dee, Duncan   }}</ref> This program was intended to provide Canadians with one million new Maple Leaf flags in time for Flag Day, 1997. The program was controversial in that the program cost approximately [[Canadian dollar|CDN]]$45 million and the flags had no means to be hoisted or flown. The official numbers from Canadian Heritage put the expenses around $15.5 million, with approximately 1/7th of the cost being off-set by donations.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-25|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/newsroom/index_e.cfm?fuseaction=displayDocument&DocIDCd=7NR233|title=Canadians Meet the "One in a Million National Flag" Challenge |publisher=[[Department of Canadian Heritage]]|date=1997-02-15|author=Arnsby, Julia  }}</ref>
