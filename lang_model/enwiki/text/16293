==Career==
===Early career===
Punk's first venture into wrestling was a stint in a [[backyard wrestling]] federation called the Lunatic Wrestling Federation with his friends in the mid-late 1990s where he first started using the [[ring name]] CM Punk when he was put into a [[tag team]] named the Chick Magnets with CM Venom after another performer skipped out on the card.<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="chickmagnets">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20040222144349/http://www.chicagowrestling.com/AL/al-cmvenom-12-17-01.htm|title=CM Venom Interview|accessmonthday=26 September|accessyear=2006|author=Lagattolla, Al|date=2001-12-17|publisher=Chicago Wrestling}}</ref><ref name="jon">{{cite web|url=http://sports.ign.com/articles/748/748635p1.html|title=CM Punk Interview|accessmonthday=19 March|accessyear=2007|author=Robinson, Jon|date=2006-12-01|publisher=IGN}}</ref> Unlike his friends, Punk genuinely wanted to be a wrestler and saw it as more than simple fun,<ref name="punkshoot" /> so after leaving the federation, he enrolled as a student at the "Steel Domain" [[wrestling school]] in Chicago, where he was trained by [[Ace Steel]], Danny Dominion and Kevin Quinn to become a professional wrestler. As part of the training, he wrestled at [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul's]] Steel Domain Wrestling.<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="wojick">{{cite web|url=http://wrestlingclothesline.com/Wojcik-Punk.htm|title=Wojick Interview|accessmonthday=26 September|accessyear=2006|author=Wojick, Alan|date=2003-06-21|publisher=The Wrestling Clothesline}}</ref> It was in the Steel Domain that he met Scott Colton,<ref name="punkcabana" /><ref name="joepunk">{{cite video|people=CM Punk; [[Samoa Joe]]|url=http://www.rohwrestling.com/shoponline.asp?point=moreinfo&catid=200&id=1220|title=Straight Shootin' with Samoa Joe & CM Punk|medium=DVD|publisher=Ring of Honor|date=March 10|year=2005|accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref> who soon adopted the stage name [[Colt Cabana]]. Punk and Cabana became best friends and spent most of their early career together working in the same [[Independent circuit|independent promotions]], as opponents or allies.<ref name="punkcabana">{{cite video|people=CM Punk; Colt Cabana|url=http://www.rohwrestling.com/shoponline.asp?point=moreinfo&catid=200&id=1397|title=Straight Shootin' with CM Punk & Colt Cabana|medium=DVD|publisher=Ring of Honor|date=July 1|year=2005|accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref> In the independents Punk, along with fellow Steel Domain graduates Colt Cabana, Chuckie Smoothe, [[Adam Pearce]] and manager [[Dave Prazak]], formed a [[Stable (professional wrestling)|stable]] named the Gold Bond Mafia.<ref name="punkshoot" />

Punk's home promotion for his early career is usually considered to be [[Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South|Independent Wrestling Association: Mid-South]] (IWA:Mid-South).<ref name="punkshoot" /> During Punk's time in IWA:Mid-South he had high profile feuds with Colt Cabana and [[Chris Hero]] while also rising to the top of the roster winning the IWA Mid-South Light-Heavyweight Championship twice and the [[IWA Mid-South Heavyweight Championship]] on five separate occasions. Notably his feud with Hero included a 55-minute [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match|TLC match]],<ref name="punkshoot" /> a 93-minute [[two out of three falls match]]<ref 
name="wojick" /> and several 60-minute draws.<ref name="joepunk" /> Punk's matches with Cabana led him to being hired by [[Ring of Honor]] promotion.<ref name="wojick" /> During his time in IWA:Mid-South he would also meet, wrestle against and become a friend of [[Eddie Guerrero]].<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="wojick" /> From February 2003 until May 2004 Punk refused to wrestle for IWA:Mid-South. Punk claims that this was in protest to [[Ian Rotten]]'s treatment of Chris Hero;<ref name="punkshoot" /> however Hero himself has stated he believes there were other reasons and Rotten's treatment of him was just an excuse by Punk to stop working for the company.<ref name="heroshoot">{{cite video|people=[[Chris Hero]]|url=http://www.rfvideo.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&ProdID=2708|title=Shoot with Chris Hero|medium=DVD|publisher=RF Video|year =2005|accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref> Eventually Punk returned to IWA:Mid-South and continued to perform as a wrestler and commentator for them until [[2005]] when he was signed to World Wrestling Entertainment. His last appearance in IWA:Mid-South was on [[July 2]] [[2005]] in which he competed in a sixty-minute time limit draw against [[Delirious (wrestler)|Delirious]].

===Ring of Honor and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling===
Punk joined [[Ring of Honor]] initially as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]], but was quickly [[Turn (professional wrestling)|turned]] [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] in a feud with [[Scott Levy|Raven]] that featured numerous variants of [[Professional wrestling match types#No Disqualification match|no disqualification matches]]. At the same time Punk joined the wrestling promotion [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|NWA:Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]], where he was paired with [[Brian Wohl|Julio Dinero]] as, ironically, members of [[Scott Levy|Raven's]] TNA [[Stable (professional wrestling)|stable]] [[Raven's Nest#The Gathering|The Gathering]].

Punk started climbing the ranks of ROH with notable achievements including coming second at the ''Second Anniversary'' show during the tournament to crown the first [[ROH Pure Championship|ROH Pure Champion]], losing to [[A.J. Styles]] in the finals, and winning the [[ROH World Tag Team Championship|ROH Tag Team Championship]] twice with Colt Cabana as the [[Second City Saints]], both times defeating the [[Briscoe Brothers]] to win the championship. Circa October [[2003]] Punk was hired as the first head trainer of the [[Ring of Honor#ROH wrestling school|Ring of Honor wrestling school]],<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="slamcanoe">{{cite web| url = http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/06/06/1073740.html| title = CM Punk mulls over his future| accessdate = 17 April| accessyear = 2007| author = Hillhouse, Dave| date = 2005-06-06| publisher = SLAM!

[[Image:Punkindependent.jpg|thumb|left|CM Punk in a match against Danny Dominion at an [[NWA Midwest]] event.]]
Meanwhile in TNA on [[February 25]] [[2004]] Punk had a physical scuffle with [[Teddy Hart]] that was broken up by [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] outside of a restaurant shortly before a TNA show stemming from an ROH show in which Hart performed [[Teddy Hart#Ring of Honor|three unplanned spots]] putting several other wrestlers in danger of injury.<ref name="teddyhartlj">{{cite web|url=http://cmpunk.livejournal.com/2003/11/12/|title=My turn...|accessdate=13 July|accessyear=2007|author=CM Punk|date=2003-11-12|publisher=LiveJournal}}</ref><ref name="shootteddyhart">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingobserver.com/wo/news/headlines/default.asp?aID=15350|title=Derek Burgan reviews Best of Teddy Hart & Jack Evans|accessdate=13 June|accessyear=2007|author=Burgan, Derek|date=2006-01-28|format=asp|publisher=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|quote=The interviewer immediately asked Teddy about the situation with CM Punk.

Sports}}</ref>

In ROH Punk faced off against [[ROH World Championship|ROH World Champion]] [[Samoa Joe]] for the championship in a famous three match series. The first match, on [[June 12]] [[2004]] at ''World Title Classic'' in [[Dayton, Ohio]], resulted in a 60 minute time-limit draw when neither Punk nor Joe could pin or cause the other to submit in the sixty minutes. The second match between Samoa Joe and CM Punk was planned to have occurred on [[December 4]] [[2004]] but because [[Steve Corino]] was pulled from a match with Samoa Joe by [[Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX|Pro Wrestling ZERO-ONE]] the second match was hastily rescheduled on [[October 11]] [[2004]] for [[October 16]] in Punk's hometown of [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]].<ref name="joepunk" /> At ''Joe vs. Punk II'' on [[October 16]] they wrestled to a second 60 minute draw. In addition to becoming Ring of Honor's best selling DVD at that point, the match received the first 5-star rating by [[Dave Meltzer]]'s ''Wrestling Observer Newsletter'' for a match in North America since 1997.<ref name="joepunk" /> Joe ended the series by defeating Punk in the third and final match on [[December 4]] [[2004]] at ''All-Star Extravaganza 2'' in which there was a no time limit stipulation.

In June 2005, Punk accepted a deal with [[World Wrestling Entertainment]], after a try-out match against [[Sean Morley|Val Venis]] on its ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night HEAT]]'' show. Even though he had accepted the deal, Punk went on to defeat [[Austin Aries]] to win the [[ROH World Championship]] on [[June 18]] [[2005]] at ''Death Before Dishonor III'' with the [[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Pepsi Plunge]].

Immediately after the match Punk proceeded to [[Turn (professional wrestling)|turn]] heel and started an angle where he threatened to bring the ROH World Championship to WWE with him. For weeks, Punk teased the ROH locker room and the ROH fans as well as mocking the championship he possessed, going so far as to sign his WWE contract on it. A notable part of this angle was [[Mick Foley]] making several ROH appearances, attempting to convince Punk to do the right thing and defend the title on his way out.

On [[August 12]] [[2005]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]] Punk lost the ROH World Championship to [[Jamie Noble|James Gibson]] in a four corner elimination match consisting of himself, Gibson, [[Samoa Joe]] and [[Christopher Daniels]], who re-debuted after a year and half long absence following the Rob Feinstein controversy a few minutes after Punk turned heel, when Gibson countered the Pepsi Plunge with a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Super|Super]] [[Powerbomb#Double underhook powerbomb|Tiger Bomb]]. His final scheduled match in Ring of Honor took place at ''Punk: The Final Chapter'' on [[August 13]] [[2005]] against long-time friend Colt Cabana in a [[professional wrestling match types#two out of three falls|2 out of 3 falls match]], which he lost. In his last match, he was visibly crying, and was showered with streamers when he posed in the middle of the ring.

Punk reappeared at the ROH show ''Unscripted II'' on [[February 11]] [[2006]], when [[Brandon Silvestry|Low Ki]] left the promotion the week prior and most of the roster contracted to TNA was pulled from the show.<ref name"unscripted1">{{cite web

====Ohio Valley Wrestling====
Punk was assigned to [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]], a WWE developmental territory. On [[September 26]] [[2005]] in his OVW television debut, Punk suffered a ruptured eardrum and broken nose at the hands of Danny Inferno, after he was hit by an [[Botch (professional wrestling)|overly]] [[Stiff (professional wrestling)|stiff]] [[Punch (strike)|right hand]]. Despite the injury, Punk finished the match and quickly recovered.<ref name="ovwresults05">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/ovw/2005.html|title=Ohio Valley Wrestling - 2005 Results|accessdate=30th July|accessyear=2006|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref><ref name="lordsofpaininjury">{{cite web|url=http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/2005_/articles/1126805425.php|title=Latest on released WWE wrestler, Ken Kennedy, CM Punk injury|accessdate=26 September|accessyear=2006|author=Cantor, Brian|date=2005-09-15|format=php|publisher=Lords of Pain}}</ref>

On [[November 9]] [[2005]], Punk became the [[OVW Television Championship|OVW Television Champion]] after defeating [[Ken Doane]].<ref name="ovwresults05"/> This led immediately to a feud between Punk and [[Brent Albright]], who had previously been feuding with Doane for the television championship and had lost his chance to wrestle Doane after Punk had hit him with a chair so he himself could wrestle Doane. This led to a series of matches, including one which ended in overtime with Albright having Punk submit to Albright's finisher, the [[Professional wrestling holds#Fujiwara armbar|Crowbar]], however Punk was able to keep the championship as he had not agreed to the extra time.<ref name="ovwresults05"/> On [[January 4]] [[2006]], Punk lost the OVW Television Championship during a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|three way dance]] between himself, Albright and Doane. Doane was injured halfway through the match and could not continue and was replaced by [[Aaron Stevens (wrestler)|Aaron "The Idol" Stevens]]. Punk submitted to Albright's Crowbar and was eliminated but after interference by Punk, Stevens was able to get the [[Pinfall (professional wrestling)|pin]] on Albright to become the new OVW Television Champion.<ref name="ovwresults06">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/ovw/2006.html|title=Ohio Valley Wrestling - 2006 Results|accessdate=30th July|accessyear=2006|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> The feud continued after a short period in which Albright and Punk were a tag team, but they became opponents again after Albright wanted the respect of Punk who would never give it to him and instead proceeded to "punk out" (get the better of) Albright repeatedly. This continued for weeks with Punk always getting the better of Albright until a double turn occurred on [[February 1]] [[2006]] when Albright turned heel during a tag match allowing [[Spirit Squad|The Spirit Squad]] to beat Punk and, in doing so, turning Punk face.<ref name="ovwresults06"/>

During this time CM Punk had a minor appearance at ''[[WrestleMania 22]]'' on [[April 2]] [[2006]] as one of the [[gangster]]s who rode a 1930s era car to the ring before [[John Cena]]'s entrance.<ref name="wmgangster">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/pictures/c/cmpunk/19.jpg|title = 19.jpg|accessdate=26 September|accessyear=2006|date=2006-04-02|publisher=Obsessed With Wrestling|quote=CM Punk as a gangster during [[John Cena]]'s entrance}}</ref>

When [[Matt Cappotelli]] vacated the [[OVW Heavyweight Championship]] due to a brain tumor, a tournament was held to crown a new champion. The finals were Brent Albright vs CM Punk with Albright defeating Punk to become the new champion.<ref name="ovwresults06"/> Punk and Albright continued their feud with Albright becoming more and more unstable and paranoid about maintaining his championship after several close call matches against Punk, resulting in acts such as threatening [[Maria Kanellis|Maria]]. On [[May 3]] [[2006]], Punk finally defeated Brent Albright in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Texas Bullrope Match|strap match]] to win the OVW Heavyweight Championship.<ref name="ovwresults06"/> As champion, Punk retained the title in matches against opponents such as [[Shad Gaspard]],<ref name="ovwresults06"/> [[Ken Anderson (wrestler)|Ken Kennedy]],<ref name="ovwresults06"/> [[Johnny Jeter]],<ref name="ovwresults06"/> and [[Mike Mizanin|Mike "The Miz" Mizanin]].<ref name="punkvsmiz">{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman/publish/article_17333.shtml|title=7/15 OVW in Cordyon, Ind.: C.M.

On [[July 28]] [[2006]] Punk and [[Seth Skyfire]] defeated [[Cryme Tyme|Shad Gaspard and the Neighborhoodie]] to win the [[OVW Southern Tag Team Championship]] at a [[house show]].<ref name="sixflags">{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/misc/ovw/sixflags.html#072806|title=Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom drawing 500|accessdate=27 August|accessyear=2006|author=Pro Wrestling History|date=2006-07-28|work=Ohio Valley Wrestling Six Flag Shows}}</ref> With the victory Punk became the second OVW wrestler to have held each of the promotion's three championships, following Brent Albright, and along with Skyfire the first to hold two championships simultaneously. They would lose the Tag Team Championship on [[August 2]] [[2006]] to [[Jimmy Reiher, Jr.|Deuce Shade]] and [[Cliff Compton|"Domino" Cliff Compton]] after an injured Skyfire tagged in an already injured Punk.<ref name="ovwresults06"/>

This lead to a feud between Punk and Skyfire after a rematch for the Tag Team Championship on [[August 7]] [[2006]] in which a healthy Punk purposefully tagged in an injured Skyfire to be beaten by Shade and Compton.<ref name="ovwresults06"/> On [[August 30]] [[2006]] a match was scheduled to take place between Punk and Skyfire for the OVW Heavyweight Championship however prior to the match Skyfire was attacked by Charles "The Hammer" Evans, who Skyfire had also been feuding with, and was replaced in the match by Chet Jablonski (Chet the Jet) who pinned Punk to win the OVW Heavyweight Championship.<ref name="ovwresults06"/> As he no longer possessed the championship OVW no longer required him so he was removed from the roster and brought up to the WWE roster full time. He continues to make sporadic appearances for the company such as at the 400th episode of OVW on television.<ref name="ovwresults06"/>

Due to the [[WWE Brand Extension#June 2007 (Draft Lottery)|drafting]] of [[ECW World Championship|ECW World Champion]] [[Bobby Lashley]] to ''RAW'' the ECW World Championship was declared vacant and a mini-tournament was announced to declare a new champion between Punk, Elijah Burke, [[Monty Brown|Marcus Cor Von]] and the recently drafted [[Chris Benoit]].

==Gimmick==
Punk has adopted his real-life following of the [[straight edge]] movement as his professional wrestling [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]], but the gimmick uses different elements of Punk's personality and the beliefs of the straight edge movement depending on his [[Professional wrestling slang#A|alignment]]. While portraying a [[face (professional wrestling)|face]], the gimmick tends to be that of Punk's normal personality,<ref name="punkshoot" /> largely indifferent to others who drink [[alcohol]], smoke [[tobacco]], partake in [[recreational drug use]] or have [[promiscuity|promiscuous]] [[human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]], but emphasizing the social discipline involved with [[abstinence]]. Conversely, his [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] personality tends to be that of a [[Hardline (subculture)|hardliner]], exemplifying the elitist attitudes and superiority complexes possessed by hardliners - defined by Punk's common mantra during heel [[Promo (professional wrestling)|promos]] that, because he is straight edge, he is "better than you".<ref name="punkshoot" /> Regardless of alignment, Punk performs the straight edge symbol of crossing his arms in an X formation while having the letter X written on the back of his hands, usually drawn on his wrist tape.

The meaning of the CM portion of Punk's ring name is a source of discussion as to its meaning and origins. Originally the CM stood simply for "Chick Magnet" as it related to his original backyard wrestling tag team<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="jon" /> however Punk would later state that CM had multiple meanings and would give different answers and stories when asked such as "[[Cookie Monster]]",<ref name="WWEuncut">{{cite web
|url=http://www.wwe.com/content/media/video/vms/wweuncut/2007/may29-31/4775196|title=WWE UnCut: CM Punk|accessdaymonth=June 12|accessyear=2007|date=2007-05-29|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment}}</ref> "[[#In wrestling|Crooked Moonsault]]",<ref name="cagematchde">{{cite web|url=http://www.cagematch.de/?id=2&nr=00000080|title=Datenbank Profil - CM Punk|accessmonthday=September 26|accessyear=2006|publisher=Cagematch.de|language=German}}</ref> "[[Chuck Mosley]]",<ref name="cagematchde" /> "[[Montgomery Burns|Charles Montgomery]]"<ref name="jon" /> and "[[Charles Manson]]".<ref name="jon" />

An integral part of Punk's gimmick is that of the numerous [[tattoo]]s that adorn his body, some of which have come to become symbols associated with Punk as well as [[mantra]]s and declarations that have been integrated into his gimmick. The tattoos as a whole, due to their large quantity and variety, have also become an attribute identifiable to Punk. The most important of the individual tattoos in Punk's character, whether through association, symbol, or mantra, are: 
*A [[Pepsi-Cola|Pepsi]] logo on his left shoulder which inspired the names of two of his [[#In wrestling|signature moves]] which also became a symbol of Punk himself, wearing the logo on his ring gear in the independent circuit as well as a slightly modified Pepsi logo being used as part of his [[Jumbotron|TitanTron]] entrance video.<ref name="tron">{{cite video|people=CM Punk|year=2006|title=Entrance video|url=http://www.wwe.com/content/media/video/tvshows/ecw/entrance_videos/0724cmpunkentvid|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment}}</ref> He got the tattoo as a joke, as many [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] members in his school were getting beer logos tattooed on their body, so Punk, a keen Pepsi drinker, chose to receive a Pepsi tattoo to emphasize his straight edge beliefs.<ref name="wojick" /> The tattoo is also a reference to former [[Minor Threat]] guitarist [[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]], who had a [[Coca-Cola]] tattoo and explained this by saying "I like Coca-Cola". When people inquire about Punk's Pepsi tattoo, he often replies "I like Pepsi" in a similar fashion.<ref name="punkshoot" />
*The words "[[Straight Edge]]" are spelled out on his stomach. This tattoo is one of Punk's oldest tattoos<ref name="wwemag">{{cite journal|author=CM Punk|year=2006|month=October|title=The Illustrated Man|journal=WWE Magazine|pages=13}}</ref> and has been referred to by Punk as his identity.<ref name="cheesegrater">{{cite video | people = CM Punk | url = http://www.rohwrestling.com/shoponline.asp?point=moreinfo&catid=&id=1125&pRange=0&iCurrentPage=1 |title = Best Of American Super Juniors Tournament|medium = DVD|publisher = Ring of Honor|date = 2 April |year = 2005 |accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref>
*A [[sleeve tattoo]] on his left arm entitled "luck is for losers", a mantra used on some of the choices for Punk's first [[Extreme Championship Wrestling (WWE)|ECW]] [[T-shirt]],<ref name="shirt">{{cite web|url=http://punk-wrestling.com/coppermine/thumbnails.php?album=1|title=ECW T-Shirt Designs|accessmonthday=2 October|accessyear=2006|format=php|publisher=Punk-Wrestling}}</ref> that features twists on numerous symbols of [[good luck]].
*His knuckles spell out "DRUG FREE" when placed together, "DRUG" on the right knuckles and "FREE" on the left. This tattoo is often used in wrestling as a taunting gesture to the crowd and opponents.
*A tattoo on the back of his left hand reading "No gimmicks needed".<ref name="PS155">{{Citation

<Br />Punk's character and gimmick have been parodied by the wrestling federation [[Chikara Pro Wrestling|CHIKARA]] with the character [[Necro Butcher|CP Munk]], the straight edge [[chipmunk]]. The character is simply a chipmunk [[mascot]] costume which includes references to Punk such as X marked wrist tape, a Pepsi logo on the costume's left shoulder, and a high-pitch version of Punk's best-known independent circuit theme song ''[[Miseria Cantare - The Beginning]]'', as performed by the band [[AFI (band)|AFI]].<ref name="cpmunk2">{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/24/15028|title=Tape review: Chikara, "Negative Balance," Aug. 13, w/Hero-Kingston, Claudio-Quack, Cannon-Reckless|accessmonthday=16 October|accessyear=2006|author=Vetter, Chris|date=2005-10-04|format=cgi|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|quote=CP Munk is a wrestler in a chipmunk costume, like a school mascot outfit.

==Personal life==

Punk worked other jobs to support himself in his early career, the last of which was as a laboratory technician for [[Underwriters Laboratories]] until he was fired due to poor conduct and work ethic in October, 2002.<ref name="punkshoot" />

CM Punk made an appearance on the [[February 16]] [[2004]] episode of [[Monster Garage]], "Box Truck Wrestling Car", performing a short match with [[Samoa Joe]].<ref name="ihsjt">{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/24/14286|title=Interview Highlights: Samoa Joe talks about his decision to sign with TNA, his future|accessmonthday=8 November|accessyear=2006|date=2005-08-01|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch}}</ref> On [[October 31]] [[2006]], CM Punk joined the [[The Atlantic Paranormal Society]] (TAPS) to shoot the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] special ''[[Ghost Hunters#Specials|Ghost Hunters Live]]'', which was a six-hour show broadcast live [[Halloween]] night from the [[Stanley Hotel]] in [[Estes Park]], [[Colorado]].
