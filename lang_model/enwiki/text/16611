'''Lucius Aelius Seianus''' (or '''Sejanus''') ([[20 BC]] &ndash; [[October 18]], [[31|31 AD]]) was an ambitious soldier, friend and confidant of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Tiberius]]. An [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] by birth, Sejanus rose to power as [[Praetorian Prefect|prefect]] of the Roman imperial [[bodyguard]] known as the [[Praetorian Guard]], of which he was commander from [[14|14 AD]] until his death in 31.

Sejanus introduced a number of reforms which saw the Praetorians evolve beyond a mere bodyguard into a powerful and influential unit involved in public security, civil administration, and ultimately political intercession. The reforms of Sejanus formally established the Praetorian Guard as the true basis of imperial power, and would have a lasting impact on the course of the [[Principate]].

During the [[20s]], Sejanus gradually accumulated power by consolidating his influence over the emperor and eliminating potential political opponents, including the son of Tiberius, [[Julius Caesar Drusus]]. When Tiberius withdrew to Capri in [[26]], Sejanus was left in control of the entire state mechanism as de facto ruler of the empire. For a time the most influential and feared citizen of Rome, Sejanus suddenly fell from power the same year his career culminated with the [[Roman consul|consulship]] in [[31]]. Amidst suspicions of conspiracy against the emperor, Sejanus was arrested and executed, along with his followers.

== Family ==
Sejanus was born in [[20 BC]] at [[Volsinii]], [[Etruria]], to the family of Cosconia Lentuli Maluginensis and [[Lucius Seius Strabo]],<ref name="tacitus-annals-iv-1">Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#1|IV.1]]</ref><ref name="adams-sejanus">{{cite journal | last = Adams | first = Freeman | title = The Consular Brothers of Sejanus. | journal = The American Journal of Philology | volume = 76  | pages = 70<U+2013>76 | date = [[1955]] | url = http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-9475%281955%2976%3A1%3C70%3ATCBOS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-B | accessdate=2007-07-23}}</ref> an [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] who became Praetorian prefect under [[Augustus Caesar|Augustus]]. By [[Roman naming convention#Adoption|Roman custom]] he was known as Aelius Sejanus after his adoption into the more prestigious [[Aelius|Aelian]] [[gens]]. The Aelii counted two consuls among their family, [[Quintus Aelius Tubero]] ([[11 BC]]) and [[Sextus Aelius Catus]] ([[4|4 AD]]), who was the father of [[Aelia Paetina]], future wife of [[Claudius]]. Sejanus' uncle was [[Junius Blaesus]], a military commander who became [[proconsul]] of [[Africa Province|Africa]] in [[21|21 AD]] and earned [[Roman triumph|triumphal honors]] by crushing the rebellion of [[Tacfarinas]].<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#72|III.72]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#73|III.73]]</ref>

According to the ancient historian [[Tacitus]], Sejanus was also a former favourite of the wealthy [[Marcus Gavius Apicius|Apicius]],<ref name="tacitus-annals-iv-1"/> whose daughter may have been Sejanus' first wife Apicata. With Apicata, he had three children,<ref name="tacitus-annals-iv-3">Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#3|IV.3]]</ref> two sons and one daughter: Strabo, Capito Aelianus and Junilla.<ref name="adams-sejanus"/>

== Rise to power ==
=== Praetorian prefect ===

Little is known about the life Sejanus led prior to [[14|14 AD]], but according to Tacitus, he accompanied [[Gaius Caesar]], adopted grandson of Augustus, during his campaigns in [[Kingdom of Armenia|Armenia]] in [[1 BC]].<ref name="tacitus-annals-iv-1"/> It was upon the accession of [[Tiberius]] in 14 AD, that Sejanus was appointed [[Praetorian prefect|prefect]] of the [[Praetorian Guard]] as the colleague of his father Strabo, and began his rise to prominence. 

The Praetorian Guard was an elite unit of the [[Roman army]] which had been formed by Augustus in [[27 BC]], with the specific function to serve as a [[bodyguard]] to the emperor and members of the imperial family. Much more than a guard however, the Praetorians also managed the day-to-day care of the city, such as general security and civil administration.<ref name="bingham-praetorians">{{cite book |last=Bingham |first=Sandra J. |title=The praetorian guard in the political and social life of Julio-Claudian Rome |origyear=1997 |url=http://amicus.collectionscanada.ca/s4-bin/Main/ItemDisplay?coll=19&itm=24141235&rsn=S_WWWymaKWJQUZ |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |accessdate=2007-05-23 |year=1999 |publisher=National Library of Canada |location=Ottawa |isbn=0-612-27106-4 }}</ref> Of political significance was the fact that their presence served as a constant reminder of the substantial armed force which served as the basis to the emperor's power.<ref name="bingham-praetorians"/> Augustus was careful however to uphold the [[Roman Republic|republican]] veneer of this regime, and only allowed nine [[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]] to be formed (one less than in a normal [[Roman legion]]), which were inconspicuously scattered across various lodging houses in the city, and commanded by two prefects.

When Strabo was assigned to the [[Roman governor|governorship]] of [[<U+00C6>gyptus|Egypt]] in [[15|15 AD]], Sejanus became the sole commander of the Praetorians and instigated reforms that helped shape the guard into a powerful tool of the [[principate]].<ref name="dio-history-lvii-19">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/57*.html#19 LVII.19]</ref> In [[20]] the scattered encampments inside the city were centralized into [[Castra Praetoria|a single garrison]] just outside Rome<ref name="tacitus-annals-iv-2">Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#2|IV.2]]</ref><ref>Syme believes Tacitus delayed mention of these reforms until the year 23 for stylistic reasons. The actual date the Castra Praetoria was founded may have been 20 AD. See Syme, Ronald (1958). ''Tacitus'', Volume 1, p424, Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-814327-3</ref> and the number of cohorts was increased from nine to twelve,<ref name="bingham-praetorians"/> one of which now held the daily guard at the palace. The practice of joint leadership between two prefects was abandoned, and Sejanus himself appointed the [[Centurion (Roman army)|centurions]] and [[Tribune#Roman military officers|tribunes]].<ref name="tacitus-annals-iv-2"/> With these changes in effect, Sejanus now commanded the complete loyalty of a force of around 12,000 soldiers, all of which were at his immediate disposal. The facade of Augustus was no longer maintained, and Tiberius openly displayed the strength of the guard at parades.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/57*.html#22 LVII.22]</ref>

=== Feud with Drusus ===
[[Image:Drusus minor (Museo del Prado) 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bust of [[Julius Caesar Drusus|Drusus the Younger]], son of Tiberius. In a conspiracy that involved his own wife [[Livilla]], Drusus was poisoned in 23 by agents of Sejanus.]]
In his capacity of Praetorian prefect Sejanus quickly became a trusted advisor to Tiberius. By 23 he already exerted a considerable influence over the emperor's decisions, who referred to Sejanus as "my partner in my toils".<ref name="tacitus-annals-iv-2"/> By this time he had been raised to the rank of [[praetor]], a position which was not normally granted to Romans of the [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian class]].<ref name="dio-history-lvii-19"/> A statue had been erected in his honor in the [[Theatre of Pompey]],<ref>Seneca the Younger, ''Essays'', To Marcia On Consolation [http://www.stoics.com/seneca_essays_book_2.html#%E2%80%98MARCIAM1 XXII.4]</ref> and in the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] his followers were advanced with public offices and governorships.<ref name="tacitus-annals-iv-2"/> However this privileged position caused resentment among the senatorial class and the imperial family, in particular earning him the enmity of [[Julius Caesar Drusus]], Tiberius' son.

The history of Sejanus and Drusus dated back to at least [[15|15 AD]]. That year a [[mutiny]] had broken out among [[Roman legion|legions]] posted in [[Pannonia]] and [[Germania]]. While his adopted son [[Germanicus]] restored order in Germania, Tiberius' own son Drusus was sent to quell the uprising in Pannonia, accompanied by Sejanus and two Praetorian [[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]].<ref name="tacitus-annals-i-24">Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#24|I.24]]</ref> In part due to what the soldiers believed to be bad [[omen]]s, Drusus quickly managed to restore the stability in the army and publicly put the chief instigators to death. The camp was purged of mutineers by the Praetorians and the legions returned to the [[Castra#Types of castra|winter barracks]].<ref>Tacitus ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#29|I.29]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#30|I.30]]</ref> Despite this success, the following years witnessed a growing animosity between Drusus and Sejanus. 

Since the accession of Tiberius Drusus had been systematically groomed as the successor of his father, successfully commanding legions in [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] in [[18]],<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#44|II.44]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#62|II.62]]</ref> and sharing the consulship with Tiberius in [[21]].<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#31|III.31]]</ref> In practice however it was still Sejanus who was the second man in the empire, and he was ambitious to further expand his power. As early as 20, Sejanus had sought to solidify his connection with the imperial family by betrothing his daughter Junilla to the son of [[Claudius]], Claudius Drusus.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#29|III.29]]</ref> At the time the girl was only 4 years old but the marriage was nonetheless prevented when the boy accidentally died a few days later of [[asphyxia]]tion.<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Claudius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#27 27]</ref> 

When this failed it seems Sejanus turned his attention toward eliminating Drusus. By [[23]] the enmity between the two men had reached a critical point. During an argument Drusus had struck him with his fist,<ref name="tacitus-annals-iv-3">Tacitus, ''Annals'' [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Annals_%28Tacitus%29/Book_4#3 IV.3]</ref> and he openly lamented that "a stranger was invited to assist in the government while the emperor's son was alive".<ref name="tacitus-annals-iv-7">Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#7|IV.7]]</ref> With Tiberius already in his sixties, there was a real possibility of Drusus succeeding his father in the near future. To secure his position Sejanus secretly plotted against him and succeeded in seducing his wife [[Livilla]].<ref name="tacitus-annals-iv-3"/> With her as an accomplice Drusus was slowly poisoned and died of seemingly natural causes on [[September 13]], [[23]].<ref name="tacitus-annals-iv-8">Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#8|IV.8]]</ref>

=== Consolidation of power ===
[[Image:Tiberius NyCarlsberg01.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Bust of Emperor [[Tiberius]] ([[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]], [[Copenhagen]]). During the [[20s|twenties]] Tiberius became increasingly embittered with Roman politics and eventually withdrew to the island of [[Capri]], leaving the administration largely in the hands of Sejanus.]]
The loss of his son was a major blow to Tiberius, both personally and politically. Over the years he had grown increasingly disillusioned with the position of princeps, and by sharing the [[Tribune#Tribune of the Plebs|tribunician powers]] with Drusus in [[22]] had prepared to relent some of his responsibilities in favour of his son.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#56|III.56]]</ref> With these hopes now dashed, Tiberius left his administration more than ever in the care of Sejanus, and looked toward the sons of [[Germanicus]] as possible future heirs.<ref name="tacitus-annals-iv-8"/>

Germanicus himself had died in [[19]] in somewhat suspicious circumstances in [[History_of_Syria#Syria in antiquity|Syria]].<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#72|II.72]]</ref> Following his death, his wife [[Agrippina the Elder|Agrippina]] returned to Rome with their five children and became increasingly involved with a group of senators who opposed the growing power of Sejanus. Her relations with Tiberius became increasingly fraught as she made it clear that she believed that he was responsible for the death of Germanicus.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#52|IV.52]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#53|IV.53]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#54|IV.54]]</ref> The climate was further poisoned by the hatred that Tiberius' mother [[Livia|Livia Augusta]] felt for her, since Agrippina's ambition, to be the mother of emperors and thus Rome's first woman, was an open secret.<ref name="tacitus-annals-iv-12">Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#12|IV.12]]</ref> To Sejanus personally, Agrippina's sons [[Nero Caesar|Nero]], [[Drusus Caesar|Drusus]] and [[Caligula|Gaius Caligula]] were considered a direct threat to his power.<ref name="tacitus-annals-iv-12"/>

Meanwhile, Sejanus again attempted to marry into the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|Julio-Claudian]] family. Having divorced Apicata two years earlier he requested marriage with Livilla in [[25]], possibly with an eye towards placing himself, as an adopted [[Julius|Julian]], in the position of a potential successor.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#39|IV.39]]</ref> The Emperor denied this request, warning Sejanus that he was in danger of overstepping his rank.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#40|IV.40]]</ref> Alarmed by this sudden denigration, Sejanus changed his plans and began to isolate Tiberius from Rome. By fueling his [[paranoia]] towards Agrippina and the Senate he induced the emperor to withdraw to the countryside of [[Campania]], which he did in [[26]], and finally to the island of [[Capri]], where he would spend the remainder of his life until his death in [[37]].<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#57|IV.57]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#67|IV.67]]</ref> Guarded by the Praetorians, Sejanus easily controlled all information that passed between Tiberius and the capital.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#41|IV.41]]</ref>

Despite the withdrawal of Tiberius from Rome's political scene, the presence of Livia seems to have checked Sejanus' overt power for a time. According to Tacitus, her death in [[29]] changed all that.<ref name="tacitus-annals-v-3">Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 5#3|V.3]]</ref> Sejanus began a series of purge trials of [[Roman Senator|senator]]s and wealthy equestrians in the city, removing those capable of opposing his power as well as extending the imperial (and his own) treasury. Networks of [[espionage|spies]] and informers brought the victims to trial with false accusations of [[treason]], and many chose suicide over the disgrace of being condemned and executed.<ref name="dio-history-lviii-4">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/58*.html#4 LVIII.4]</ref> Among those who perished were [[Gaius Asinius Gallus|Asinius Gallus]], a prominent senator and opponent of Tiberius who was linked to Agrippina's faction.<ref name="dio-history-lviii-3">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/58*.html#3 LVIII.3]</ref> Agrippina herself and two of her sons, Nero and Drusus were arrested and [[exile]]d in [[30]], and later [[Starvation|starved]] to death in suspicious circumstances.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'', [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#23|VI.23]] &ndash; [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#25|VI.25]]</ref> Only Gaius, as the last remaining son of Germanicus, managed to survive the purges of Sejanus by moving to Capri with Tiberius in [[31]].<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#3|VI.3]]</ref>

== Downfall ==
=== Denunciation ===
In 31, despite his equestrian rank, Sejanus shared the [[Roman consul|consulship]] with Tiberius [[in absentia]],<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#65 65]</ref> and finally became betrothed to [[Livilla]]. The emperor had not been seen in Rome since 26. Sejanus was de facto ruler of the Roman Empire, and senators and equestrians openly courted his favour as if he were such.<ref name="dio-history-lviii-2">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/58*.html#1 LVIII.1]</ref> His [[birthday]] was publicly observed and statues were being erected in his honour.<ref name="dio-history-lviii-2"/> With most of the political opposition crushed, Sejanus felt his position was unassailable. As the ancient historian [[Cassius Dio]] describes:

<blockquote>Sejanus was so great a person by reason both of his excessive haughtiness and of his vast power, that, to put it briefly, he himself seemed to be the emperor and Tiberius a kind of island potentate, inasmuch as the latter spent his time on the island of Capreae.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/58*.html#5 LVIII.5]</ref></blockquote>

Through years of crafty intrigues and indispensable service to the emperor, Sejanus had worked himself up to become the most powerful man in the empire. By the end of 31, he would be arrested, summarily [[Capital punishment|executed]] and his body unceremoniously cast down the [[Gemonian stairs]]. Exactly what caused his sudden downfall is unclear. Ancient historians disagree about the nature of his conspiracy, whether it was Tiberius or Sejanus who struck first, and in which order subsequent events transpired.<ref name="boddington-sejanus">{{cite journal | last = Boddington | first = Ann | title = Sejanus. Whose Conspiracy? | journal = The American Journal of Philology | volume = 84 | issue = 1 | pages = 1<U+2013>16 | date = [[January]] [[1963]] | url = http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-9475%28196301%2984%3A1%3C1%3ASWC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-R | accessdate=2007-07-23}}</ref> Modern historians consider it unlikely that Sejanus plotted to seize the imperial power for himself and, if he had planned so at all, rather might have aimed at overthrowing Tiberius to serve as a [[regent]] to [[Tiberius Gemellus]], son of Drusus, or possibly even [[Caligula|Gaius Caligula]].<ref name="boddington-sejanus"/> Unfortunately the relevant section pertaining to this period in the ''Annals'' of Tacitus has been lost. According to [[Josephus]] however, it was [[Antonia Minor|Antonia]], the mother of Livilla, who finally alerted Tiberius to the growing power of Sejanus, in a detailed letter she dispatched to Capri in the care of her [[freedman]] [[Pallas (freedman)|Pallas]].<ref>Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 6|XVIII.6.6]]</ref> 

Further details concerning Sejanus' fall are provided by Cassius Dio, writing nearly 200 years after the facts in his ''Roman History''. It appears that, when Tiberius heard to which extent Sejanus had already [[usurper|usurped]] power in Rome, he immediately took steps to remove him from power, but realised that an outright condemnation could provoke Sejanus in attempting a [[Coup d'<U+00E9>tat|coup]] against him.<ref name="dio-history-lviii-4"/> Instead he addressed a number of contradictory letters to the Senate, some of which praised Sejanus and his friends, others which suddenly denounced them. Alternatingly, Tiberius announced he would arrive in Rome the very next day, or claimed he was at the point of death.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/58*.html#6 LVIII.6]</ref>  The ensuing confusion was successful in alienating Sejanus from many of his supporters. With the intentions of the emperor no longer clear, it was now deemed a safer course of action at Rome to withdraw from overt support to Sejanus until the matter was clearly settled.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/58*.html#7 LVIII.7], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/58*.html#8 LVIII.8]</ref> 

When it became clear to Tiberius that popular support for Sejanus was not as strong as he had feared, his next step was to chose [[Naevius Sutorius Macro]], who had previously been prefect of the [[vigiles]] (Roman police and fire department),<ref name="bingham-praetorians"/> to replace Sejanus and accomplish his downfall.<ref name="dio-history-lviii-9">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/58*.html#9 LVIII.9]</ref> On [[October 18]], [[31]], Sejanus was summoned to a Senate meeting by a letter from Tiberius, ostensibly to bestow the tribunician powers upon him. At dawn he entered the Senate, but while the letter was being read Macro assumed control of the Praetorian Guard, and members of the vigiles led by [[Graecinius Laco]] surrounded the building.<ref name="dio-history-lviii-9"/> The senators at first congratulated Sejanus, but when the letter, which first digressed into completely unrelated matters, suddenly denounced him and ordered his arrest, he was immediately surrounded and escorted to [[Mamertine Prison|prison]].<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/58*.html#10 LVIII.10]</ref>

=== Execution and aftermath ===
[[Image:Sejanus Damnatio Memoriae.jpg|thumb|right|300px|In 31, Sejanus was arrested and condemned to death. The Senate issued ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'' on him; his statues were destroyed and his name obliterated from all [[public records]]. The above coin from Augusta Bilbilis has the words ''L. Aelio Seiano'' erased.]]
The same evening, the Senate convened at the [[Temple of Concord]] and summarily condemned Sejanus to death. He was led from prison, [[Garotte|strangled]] and his body cast onto the [[Gemonian stairs]], where the crowd tore it to pieces.<ref name="dio-history-lviii-11">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/58*.html#11 LVIII.11]</ref> Riots ensued in which mobs hunted down and killed anyone they could link to the terror regime of Sejanus. The Praetorians in turn resorted to [[looting]] when they were accused of having conspired with their former prefect.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/58*.html#12 LVIII.12]</ref> Following an issue of ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'' by the Senate, his statues were torn down and his name obliterated from all [[public records]]. On [[October 24]], Sejanus' eldest son Strabo was arrested and executed.<ref name="boddington-sejanus"/> Upon learning of his death, Apicata committed suicide on [[October 26]], after addressing a letter to Tiberius claiming that Drusus had been poisoned, with the complicity of Livilla.<ref>A recovered fragment of the Fasti Ostiensis confirms that Cassius Dio erred in his account on the deaths of Sejanus' family (Dio, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/58*.html#11 LVIII.11]). The eldest son Strabo was executed on October 24, Apicata committed suicide on October 26, and the remaining children were executed sometime in December. See Freeman, Adams (1955), "[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-9475%281955%2976%3A1%3C70%3ATCBOS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-B The Consular Brothers of Sejanus]" for the Latin inscription.</ref><ref name="dio-history-lviii-11"/> The accusations were further corroborated by confessions from Livilla's slaves, who admitted to having administered the poison to Drusus.<ref name="tacitus-annals-iv-11">Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#11|IV.11]]</ref>

Enraged upon learning the truth, Tiberius soon ordered more executions. Livilla herself committed suicide or, as legend would have it, was forcibly starved to death by her own mother Antonia.<ref name="dio-history-lviii-11"/> The remaining children of Sejanus, Capito Aelianus and Junilla were executed in December of that year.<ref name="adams-sejanus"/><ref name="tacitus-annals-v-9">Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 5#9|V.9]]</ref> According to ancient historians, because there was no precedent for the capital punishment of a [[virgin]], Junilla was violated before her execution, with the rope around her neck.<ref name="tacitus-annals-v-9"/><ref name="dio-history-lviii-11"/> Their bodies were likewise thrown down the Gemonian stairs. At the beginning of the following year, ''damnatio memoriae'' was passed on Livilla.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#2|VI.2]]</ref>

Although Rome at first rejoiced at the demise of Sejanus, the city quickly plunged into more extensive trials, as Tiberius relentlessly persecuted all those who could in any way be tied to the schemes of Sejanus or had courted his friendship.<ref name="tacitus-annals-vi-19">Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#19|VI.19]]</ref> The Senatorial ranks were decimated; the hardest hit were those families with political ties to the Julians.<ref name="boddington-sejanus"/> Even the imperial magistracy was not exempted from Tiberius' wrath.<ref name="tacitus-annals-vi-10">Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#10|VI.10]]</ref> Arrests and executions were now supervised by Naevius Sutorius Macro.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#29|VI.29]]</ref> The political turmoil would continue until the death of Tiberius in [[37]], after which he was succeeded by [[Caligula|Gaius Caligula]].

== Legacy ==
=== Praetorian Guard ===
Augustus's death on [[August 19]] [[14]] marked the end of Praetorian calm, the only time the Praetorian Guard did not use its military strength to play a part in the politics of Rome to force its own agenda. Augustus would be the sole emperor to command their complete loyalty. The reforms of Sejanus, most significantly the founding of the Castra Praetoria, essentially established the Praetorian Guard as the powerful political force for which it is primarily known today.<ref>{{ cite book | last = Durry | first = Marcel | title = Les Cohortes Pr<U+00E9>toriennes | year = 1938 | location = Paris | publisher = Editions De Boccard | pages = p156}}</ref> Henceforth the entire Guard was at the disposal of the emperors, but the rulers were now equally at the mercy of the Praetorians.<ref name="bingham-praetorians"/> The reality of this was seen in 31 when Tiberius was forced to rely upon members of the vigiles against his own guard.<ref name="dio-history-lviii-9"/> Although the Praetorian Guard proved faithful to the aging Tiberius, their potential political power had been made clear.<ref name="bingham-praetorians"/>

The power Sejanus attained in his capacity as prefect proved [[Maecenas]] right in his prediction to Augustus that it was dangerous to allow one man to command the guard.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/52*.html#24 LII.24]</ref> Cassius Dio notes that after Sejanus, no other prefect except [[Gaius Fulvius Plautianus]] would rise to such influence.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/58*.html#14 LVIII.14]</ref>

Nevertheless, following his death the guard began to play an increasingly ambitious and bloody role in the [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. With the right amount of money, or at will, they assassinated emperors, bullied their own prefects, or turned on the people of Rome.<ref name="bingham-praetorians"/> In [[41]] Caligula was killed by conspirators from the senatorial class and from the Guard. The Praetorians placed [[Claudius]] on the throne, daring the Senate to oppose their decision.<ref>[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|The Lives of Twelve Caesars]]'', Life of Claudius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#10 10]</ref>

=== Historiography ===
With the exception of [[Velleius Paterculus]], ancient [[historian]]s have been universally condemning of Sejanus,<ref>Philo, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book40.html#XXIV XXIV]</ref> although accounts differ to which extent Sejanus was manipulated by Tiberius or the other way around.<ref name="boddington-sejanus"/> [[Suetonius|Suetonius Tranquilius]] asserts that Sejanus was merely an instrument of Tiberius to hasten the downfall of Germanicus and his family, and that he was quickly disposed of once he ceased to be useful.<ref>[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|The Lives of Twelve Caesars]]'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#55 55]</ref> [[Tacitus]] on the other hand attributes much of the decline Tiberius' rule after [[23]] to the corrupting influence of Sejanus, although he is generally also harsh on Tiberius himself.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#7|III.7]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#51|VI.51]]</ref>

Among the writers of the time which fell victim to the regime of Sejanus and its aftermath were the historian [[Velleius Paterculus]] and the poet [[Phaedrus]]. [[Phaedrus]] was suspected of having alluded to Sejanus in his ''Fables'', and received some unknown punishment short of death (Cf. Fables I.1, I.2.24, and I.17).<ref>Phaedrus, ''Fables'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0119&query=book%3D%233 Book III, preface]</ref> Velleius Paterculus was a historian and contemporary of Sejanus whose two-volume ''The Roman History'' details a history of Rome from the fall of [[Troy]] until the death of Livia Augusta in 29. In his work he praises both Tiberius and Sejanus, even defending the latter's high position in the government despite his equestrian rank.<ref>Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2D*.html#127 II.127-128]</ref> How much of Paterculus' writing is due to genuine admiration, prudence or fear remains an open question, but it has been conjectured that he was put to death as a friend of Sejanus.<ref>Cruttwell, C.T. (1877). ''A History of Roman Literature''. Oxford, Book 3, chapter 1.</ref>

=== Sejanus in later literature ===
The rise and fall of Sejanus have been the subject, or partial subject, of several noted works in literature, including two [[17th century]] plays and [[20th century]] novels: 

*''[[Sejanus: His Fall]]'' ([[1603]]), a play by [[Ben Jonson]].
*''The Tragedy of Claudius Tiberius Nero'' ([[1607]]), a play by an anonymous contemporary of Jonson. 
*''[[I, Claudius]]'' ([[1934]]), novel by [[Robert Graves]], as well as the subsequent [[1976]] [[I, Claudius (TV series)|television adaptation]]. In television series, he is played by [[Patrick Stewart]].
*''[[Sejanus (Marcus Corvinus)|Sejanus]]'' ([[1998]]), the third novel in the [[Marcus Corvinus]] series by [[David Wishart]].
