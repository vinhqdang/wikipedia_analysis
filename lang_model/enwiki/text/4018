'''C<U+00E9>line Marie Claudette Dion Ang<U+00E9>lil''', [[Order of Canada|OC]], [[National Order of Quebec|OQ]], (born [[March 30]] [[1968]]) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] and [[Juno Award|Juno]] award winning [[popular music|pop]] [[singer]] and occasional [[songwriter]].<ref>Britannica.com. ''[http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-9311022 C<U+00E9>line Dion]''. Retrieved [[January 13]], 2006.</ref> Born to a large, impoverished family in [[Charlemagne, Quebec|Charlemagne]], [[Quebec]], Dion became a young star in [[francophone]] Canada after her manager and future husband, [[Ren<U+00E9> Ang<U+00E9>lil]], [[mortgage|mortgaged]] his home to finance her first record. She later gained recognition in parts of Europe and Asia after she won both the 1982 Yamaha [[World Popular Song Festival]] and the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1988|1988 Eurovision Song Contest]].

In 1990 Dion made her English language debut with the [[anglophone]] album ''[[Unison (album)|Unison]]'', published by [[Epic Records]]. During the 1990's, under the guidance of her husband, she achieved worldwide fame and success with several English and French records, and ended the decade as one of the most successful artists in pop music. After releasing over twenty-five albums during the 1980s and 1990s, Dion announced in 1999 that she was taking a break from entertainment in order to start a family and to focus on her husband/manager, who had been diagnosed with [[throat cancer]]. She returned to the music scene in 2002 with a more mature, exclusively [[adult contemporary]], sound, but her album sales suffered a decline, and she signed a lucrative four-year contract to perform nightly in a five-star [[theatre|theatrical]] show at the Colosseum at [[Caesars Palace]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. 

Dion's music has been influenced by various genres, which range from [[Pop music|pop]] and [[rock (music)|rock]] to [[Gospel music|gospel]] and [[European classical music|classical]], and while her releases have often been given mixed critical reception, she is renowned for her technically skilled and powerful vocals.<ref name=Elysa>Gardner, Elysa.

==Life and music career==
===Childhood and early beginnings===
[[Image:Tellement.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Dion's performance at the [[Yamaha (manufacturer)|Yamaha]] [[World Popular Song Festival]] won her the gold medal as well as the award for being the top performer.]]

The youngest of fourteen children born to Adh<U+00E9>mar Dion and Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se Tanguay, Celine Dion was raised a [[Roman Catholic]] in a poverty-stricken&mdash; but happy&mdash; home in [[Charlemagne, Quebec|Charlemagne]], a small town about 30 miles northeast of [[Montreal]]. Music had always been a part of the family, as she grew up singing with her siblings in her parents' small piano bar called 'Le Vieux Baril.' From an early age, Dion had dreamed of being a performer. In a 1994 interview with ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine, she recalled, "I missed my family and my home, but I don't regret having lost my [[adolescence]]. I had one dream: I wanted to be a singer." <ref>{{cite web | title=Rock on the Net | work= C<U+00E9>line Dion| url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-d/celinedion_main.htm| accessdate= November 30|accessyear=2005}}</ref>

At age twelve Dion collaborated with her mother and her brother Jacques to compose her first song, "[[Ce N'<U+00C9>tait Qu'un R<U+00EA>ve]]" ("It Was Only a Dream"). Her brother Michel sent the recording to music manager [[Ren<U+00E9> Ang<U+00E9>lil]], whose name he discovered on the back of a [[Ginette Reno]] album. Ang<U+00E9>lil was brought to tears by Dion's voice and decided to make her a star. He mortgaged his home to fund her first record, "[[La Voix du Bon Dieu]]" (a play on words "The Voice of God/The Road to God," 1981), which became a local number-one record and made Dion an instant star in Quebec. Her popularity spread to other parts of the world when she competed in the 1982 [[Yamaha (manufacturer)|Yamaha]] [[World Popular Song Festival]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], and won the musician's award for "Top Performer" as well as the gold medal for "Best Song" with "[[Tellement J'Ai d'Amour Pour Toi]]" ("I Have So Much Love for You"). By 1983 in addition to becoming the first Canadian artist to receive a gold record in France for the single "[[D'Amour Ou d'Amiti<U+00E9>]]" ("Of Love or of Friendship"), Dion had also won several [[F<U+00E9>lix Award|F<U+00E9>lix awards]], including "Best Female performer" and "Discovery of the year." Further success in Europe, Asia, and Australia came when Dion represented [[Switzerland]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1988|1988 Eurovision Song Contest]] with the song "[[Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi]]" ("Don't Go Without Me") and won the contest in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. However, American success was yet to come, partly because she was exclusively a francophone artist.

At eighteen, after seeing a [[Michael Jackson]] performance, Dion told Ang<U+00E9>lil that she wanted to be a star like Jackson.<ref>[http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/dion_celine/bio.jhtml ''C<U+00E9>line Dion''] provided by [[VH1]].com Retrieved [[August 16]],[[2005]]</ref> Though confident in her talent, Angelil realized that her image needed to be changed in order for her to be marketed worldwide. Dion withdrew from the spotlight for a number of months, during which she underwent a physical makeover. Finally, Dion was sent to the <U+00C9>cole Berlitz School in 1989 to polish her English and interviewing skills. This marked the start of her anglophone career.

===1990<U+2013>1992: Career breakthrough===

[[Image:Celine rocks.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Dion's earlier work consisted of strong rock music influences.]]
A year after she had learned English, Dion made her debut into the anglophone market with ''[[Unison (album)|Unison]]'' (1990). She incorporated the help of many established musicians, including  Vito Luprano and Canadian [[music producer|producer]] [[David Foster]]. The album was largely influenced by 1980s [[soft rock]] music that was suited for the [[adult contemporary]] radio format. ''Unison'' hit the right notes with critics: Jim Faber of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote that Dion's vocals were "tastefully unadorned," and that she never attempted to "bring off styles that are beyond her."<ref>{{cite web | title=Entertainment Weekly | work=Review--C<U+00E9>line Dion Unison | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/review/music/0,6115,313100_4_0_,00.html| accessdate=November 18| accessyear=2005}}</ref> Stephen Erlewine of ''[[All Music Guide]]'' declared it as "a fine, sophisticated American debut."<ref>{{cite web | title=All Music Guide | work=Review--C<U+00E9>line Dion Unison | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:6227gjlrj6in | accessdate=November 18| accessyear=2005}}</ref> Singles from the album included "[[(If There Was) Any Other Way]]," "[[The Last to Know]]," "[[Unison (song)|Unison]]," and "[[Where Does My Heart Beat Now]]," a mid-tempo soft-rock ballad which featured an [[electric guitar]]. The latter became her first single to chart on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100]], peaking at number four. The album established Dion as a rising singer in the United States, and across [[Continental Europe]] and Asia. In 1991, Dion was also a soloist in "[[Voices That Care]]," a tribute to American troops fighting in [[Operation Desert Storm]].

Dion's real international breakthrough came when she paired with [[Peabo Bryson]] to record the title track to [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s animated film ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991). The song captured a musical style that Dion would utilize in the future: sweeping, classically influenced ballads with soft instrumentation. Both a critical and commercial hit, the song became her second U.S. top ten single, and won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Song]], and the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]]. 
"[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 song)|Beauty and the Beast]]" was featured on Dion's 1992 ''[[Celine Dion (album)|eponymous album]]'', which, like her debut, had a strong rock influence combined with elements of soul and classical music. Owing to the success of the lead-off single and her collaboration with Foster and [[Diane Warren]], the album was as well received as ''Unison''. Other singles that achieved moderate success included "[[If You Asked Me To#C<U+00E9>line Dion version|If You Asked Me To]]" (a [[Cover version|cover]] of [[Patti LaBelle]]'s song from the 1989 movie ''[[Licence to Kill]]'') which peaked at number four on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100]], the gospel-tinged "[[Love Can Move Mountains]]," and "[[Nothing Broken but My Heart]]." As with Dion's earlier releases, the album had an overtone of love. 

By 1992 ''Unison'', ''C<U+00E9>line Dion'' and media appearances had propelled Dion to superstardom in North America. She had achieved one of her main objectives: wedging her way into the anglophone market and achieving fame. However, while she was experiencing rising success in the U.S., her French fans in Canada criticized her for neglecting them. She tried to reconnect with her French fans at the Felix Awards show, where, after winning "English Artist of the Year," she openly refused to accept the award. She asserted that she was &mdash; and would always be&mdash; a French, not an English, artist.<ref>{{cite web | title=C<U+00E9>line Dion | work=C<U+00E9>line Dion Biography | url=http://www.celinedionweb.com/celine-dion/en,biography.html| accessdate=April 26| accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=The Canadian Encyclopedia | work=C<U+00E9>line Dion Biography | url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0000970
| accessdate=July 14| accessyear=2006}}</ref> Apart from her commercial success, there were also changes in Dion's personal life, as Ang<U+00E9>lil, who was twenty-six years her senior, transited from manager to lover. However, the relationship was kept a secret as they both feared that the public would find their relations inappropriate.

In 1993, Dion publicly indicated her feelings for her manager by declaring him "The colour of [her] love" in the dedication section of her third anglophone album ''[[The Colour of My Love]]''. However, instead of criticizing their relationship as Dion had feared, fans embraced the couple. Eventually, Ang<U+00E9>lil and Dion married in an extravagant wedding ceremony in December 1994. 

As it was dedicated to her manager, the album's motif focused on love and romance. It became her most successful record up to that point, selling over six million copies in the U.S., two million in Canada, and peaking at number-one in many countries. The album also spawned Dion's first U.S., Canadian and Australian number-one single "[[The Power of Love (Jennifer Rush song)#C<U+00E9>line Dion version|The Power of Love]]" (a remake of [[Jennifer Rush]]'s 1985 hit), which would become her [[signature song|signature hit]] until she reached new career heights in the late 1990s. Subsequent singles, such as "[[When I Fall in Love (song)#C<U+00E9>line Dion and Clive Griffin version|When I Fall in Love]]," a [[duet]] with [[Clive Griffin]], and "[[Misled]]" failed to reach the upper tier of the pop charts in the U.S., but were moderately successful in Canada. ''The Colour of My Love'' also became Dion's first bona fide hit in Europe, and in particular the [[United Kingdom]]. Both the album and the single "Think Twice" simultaneously occupied the top of the British charts for five consecutive weeks. "Think Twice," which remained at number one for seven weeks, went on to become the fourth single by a female artist to sell in excess of one million copies in the U.K.,<ref>{{cite web | title=Celinedion.com| work=The Journey so Far| url=http://www.celinedion.com/celinedion/english/journey3.html | accessdate=August 16| accessyear=2005}}</ref> while the album was eventually certified five-times platinum for two-million copies sold.

[[Image:NextPlaneOut.jpg|left|thumb|175px|The video for "[[Next Plane Out]]" depicts Dion and her lover on the beach in the sunset. It started a trend of typical and [[clich<U+00E9>]]d love ballads, lyrics and videos.]]

Dion kept to her French roots and continued to release many francophone recordings between each English record: ''[[Dion Chante Plamondon]]'' (1991); ''[[<U+00C0> l'Olympia]]'' (1994), a live album that was recorded during one of Dion's concerts at the Olympia Theatre in [[Paris]]; and ''[[D'eux]]'' (1995 <U+2014> also known as ''The French Album'' in the United States), which would go on to become the best-selling French album of all time. As these albums were in French, the worldwide commercial success was limited. However, Dion's francophone fans embraced each release, and generally, they achieved more credibility than her anglophone works.

The mid-1990s was a transitional period for Dion's musical style, as she slowly moved away from strong rock influences and transitioned into a more pop and soul style (though the electric guitar remained a central part of her music). Her songs began with more delicate melodies that used softer instrumentations, and built up to strong climaxes, over which her vocals could be displayed.<ref name=Let>''[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:osr67u50o0jw All Music Guide]''.

''[[Falling into You]]'' ([[1996 in music|1996]]), Dion's fourth anglophone album, presented the singer at the height of her popularity, and showed a further progression of her music. In an attempt to reach a wider audience, the album combined many elements such as ornate [[orchestra|orchestral]] frills and African [[chanting]], and instruments like the [[violin]], [[Classical guitar|Spanish guitar]], [[trombone]], the [[cavaquinho]], and [[saxophone]] created a new sound.<ref name= compel>{{cite web | title=Entertainment Weekly| work= Review --Falling into You| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/review/music/0,6115,291693_4_0_,00.html| accessdate=July 14|accessyear=2006}}</ref> The singles encompassed a variety of musical styles. The title track and "[[River Deep - Mountain High|River Deep, Mountain High]]" (a [[Tina Turner]] cover) made prominent use of [[percussion]] instruments; "[[It's All Coming Back to Me Now#C<U+00E9>line Dion version|It's All Coming Back to Me Now]]" (a remake of [[Jim Steinman]]'s song) and a remake of [[Eric Carmen]]'s "[[All by Myself#C<U+00E9>line Dion version|All by Myself]]" kept their soft-rock atmosphere, but were combined with the classical sound of the [[piano]]; and the number-one single "[[Because You Loved Me]]," which was written by Diane Warren, was a maudlin ballad that served as the theme to the 1996 film ''[[Up Close & Personal]]''. ''Falling into You'' was met with generally favorable reviews. While Dan Leroy wrote that it was not very different from her previous work,<ref>{{cite web | title=Yahoo Music| work= Review --Falling into You| url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/review/12030099| accessdate=November 1 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> and Stephen Holden of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and Natalie Nichols of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that the album was formulaic,<ref>Stephen, Holden.

Dion's status on the world stage was further solidified when she was asked to perform "[[The Power of the Dream]]" at the opening ceremonies of the 1996 [[Atlanta Olympic Games]]. In March 1996 Dion launched the [[Falling into You Tour]] in support of her new album, giving concerts around the world for over a year.

Dion followed ''Falling into You'' with ''[[Let's Talk About Love]]'' ([[1997 in music|1997]]), which was publicized as its sequel.<ref name=Let>''[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:osr67u50o0jw All Music Guide]''. "Review- Let's Talk About Love." November 1998. Retrieved [[May 15]], [[2007]]</ref> The recording process took place in [[London]], [[New York City]], and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], and featured a host of special guests, such as [[Barbra Streisand]] on "[[Tell Him (1997 song)|Tell Him]]"; the [[Bee Gees]] on "[[Immortality (Celine Dion song)|Immortality]]"; and world-renowned [[tenor]] [[Luciano Pavarotti]] on "[[I Hate You Then I Love You]]." Other musicians included [[Carole King]], [[George Martin|Sir George Martin]], and [[Jamaica]]n singer [[Diana King]], who added a [[reggae]] tinge to "[[Treat Her Like a Lady]]." As the name suggests, the album had the same theme as Dion's preceding albums&mdash;"love." However, emphasis was also placed on "brotherly love" with "Where Is the Love" and "Let's Talk About Love." The most successful single from the album became the classically influenced ballad "[[My Heart Will Go On]]," which was composed by [[James Horner]], and produced by Horner and [[Walter Afanasieff]]. Serving as the love theme for the 1997 blockbuster film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', the song topped the charts in many countries across the world, and has become Dion's [[signature song]]. In support of her album, Dion embarked on the [[Let's Talk About Love Tour]] between 1998 and 1999, which received mixed reviews. 

Dion ended the 1990s with two more successful albums&mdash; the [[Christmas music|Christmas album]], ''[[These Are Special Times]]'' (1998), and the compilation album ''[[All the Way... A Decade of Song]]'' (1999). On ''These Are Special Times'', Dion had a hand in writing some of the material. The album was her most classically influenced yet, with orchestral arrangements found on virtually every track.<ref>Lewis, Randy. "Album Review / Pop; Celine Dion Aims to Be the Christmas Star; ''These Are Special Times''. ''Los Angeles Times''. 30 Oct 1998. F-28.</ref> "[[I'm Your Angel]]," a [[duet]] with [[R.

A Decade of Song'' drew together her most successful hits coupled with seven new songs, including the leadoff single "[[That's the Way It Is (Celine Dion song)|That's the Way It Is]]," a cover of [[Roberta Flack]]'s "[[The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face#C<U+00E9>line Dion version|The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face]]," and "[[All the Way (song)|All the Way]]," a duet with [[Frank Sinatra]].

[[Image:Myheartwillgoon.jpg|right|thumb|275px|"My Heart Will Go On" became one of the decade's biggest hits, winning four Grammy awards including Record and Song of the Year. {{audio| MyHeartWillGoOnSample.ogg|Audio sample}}]]

By the end of the 1990s Celine Dion had sold over 100 million albums worldwide, and had won a slew of industry awards. Her status as one of the biggest divas of contemporary music was further solidified when she was asked to perform on [[VH1]]'s ''Divas Live'' special in 1998, with superstars [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Gloria Estefan]], [[Shania Twain]], and [[Mariah Carey]]. That year she also received two of the highest honors from her home country: "Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] for Outstanding Contribution to the World of Contemporary Music" and "Officer of the [[National Order of Quebec]]." A year later she was inducted into the [[Canadian Broadcast Hall of Fame]], and was honoured with a star on [[Canada's Walk of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web | title= canadaswalkoffame.com|work =Canada's Walk of Fame|url= http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/|accessdate=October 30|accessyear=2006}}</ref> She also won the Grammy awards for "[[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]" and the most coveted "[[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]]" for "[[My Heart Will Go On]]" (the song won four awards, but two were presented to the songwriters).
 
Compared to her debut, both the quality and sound of Dion's music had also changed significantly. The soft-rock influences on her earlier releases were no longer prominent; they were replaced by more soul/adult contemporary styles. However, the theme of "love" remained in all her releases, and this led to many critics dismissing her work as banal. <ref>{{cite web | title= findarticles.com|work =The unsinkable C<U+00E9>line Dion - French-Canadian singer - Interview|url= http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1285/is_3_29/ai_54133689|accessdate=December 05| accessyear=2005}}</ref> In a scathing review of ''Let's Talk About Love'', Rob O'Connor wrote:

Dion was also criticized for some of her remakes and duets.

After releasing and promoting thirteen albums during the 1990s, Dion felt that she needed to settle down, and announced on her final album, ''[[All the Way...

Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], Dion returned to the music scene and in a televised performance sang "[[God Bless America (Celine Dion song)|God Bless America]]" at the benefit concert [[America: A Tribute to Heroes]]. Chuck Taylor of ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'' wrote that "the performance... brings to mind what has made her one of the celebrated vocalists of our time: the ability to render emotion that shakes the soul.

Dion's aptly titled ''[[A New Day Has Come (album)|A New Day Has Come]]'', released in March 2002, ended her two-year break from the music industry. The theme of the album was "new beginnings," and even though it did not incorporate many genres, a few dance-pop tunes ("[[I'm Alive (Celine Dion song)|I'm Alive]]" and "Sorry for Love") could be found among a throng of adult contemporary tracks. [[Shania Twain]] and [[Chantal Kreviazuk]] also appeared on the album and sang [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]]. The album established a more mature side of Dion with the songs "[[A New Day Has Come (song)|A New Day Has Come]]," "[[Nature Boy]]" and "[[Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)]]." This change was as a result of her new-found maternal responsibilities, because, in her own words, "becoming a mother makes you a grown-up."<ref name=vh1>{{cite web| title=VH1 | work= C<U+00E9>line Dion: Let's Talk About Success: The Singer Explains Her Career High-Points| url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1453531/04222002/dion_celine.jhtml| accessdate= December 19| accessyear= 2005}}</ref> ''A New Day Has Come'' restarted her commercial success as it topped the charts in most countries. The album featured the title track, "A New Day Has Come," and a cover of [[Etta James]]'s "[[At Last (Celine Dion single)|At Last]]." A [[CBS]] television concert helped to promote the album, during which Dion performed with [[Destiny's Child]] and [[Brian McKnight]]. While the album achieved success, critical comments suggested that it was "forgettable" and the lyrics were "lifeless." Both Rob Sheffield of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, and Ken Tucker of ''Entertainment Weekly'', stated that Dion's music had not matured during her break, and classed her music as trite and mediocre.<ref>{{cite web | title=Rolling Stone|work=Review--A New Day has come| url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/_/id/175170/celinedion?pageid=rs.ArtistDiscographyMainReleases&pageregion=mainRegion | accessdate=November 1| accessyear=2005}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,219376,00.html Entertainment Weekly].

[[Image:ImageOHcap5.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The upbeat tempo of "[[One Heart (song)|One Heart]]" and the bright colours and "party" style of the music video were a new direction to C<U+00E9>line Dion's work.]]
Drawing inspiration from personal experiences, Dion released ''[[One Heart]]'' (2003), an album that encapsulated her appreciation for the joys of life.<ref>Flick, Larry. ''One Heart''. [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' magazine. New York: [[March 29]], [[2003]]. Vol.115, Iss. 13;  pg. 30, 1 pgs</ref> The album largely consisted of dance music &mdash; a deviation from the soaring, melodramatic ballads, for which she had once been given mixed reception. Although it achieved moderate success, ''One Heart'' hinted at Dions' inability to overcome the creative wall that she had hit, and words such as "predictable" and "banal" appeared even in the most lenient reviews.<ref>{{cite web | title=All Music Guide | work=Review--One Heart| url= http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:30dovwnqa9ek| accessdate=July 17| accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref>Durchholz, Daniel.

Atlanta, Georgia: [[March 25]], [[2003]]. pg. C.1.</ref> 

By the mid 2000s Dion's music had changed to the point where her releases possessed maternal overtones. ''[[Miracle (Celine Dion album)|Miracle]]'' (2004), a multimedia project conceived by Dion and photographer [[Anne Geddes]], had a theme centering on babies and motherhood. The album was saturated with lullabies and other songs of maternal love and inspiration, the two most popular being covers of [[Louis Armstrong]]'s "[[What a Wonderful World]]" and [[John Lennon]]'s "[[Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)#C<U+00E9>line Dion version|Beautiful Boy]]." The reviews for ''Miracle'' were generally weak: while [[Charles Taylor]] of ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'' magazine wrote that the single "Beautiful Boy" was "an unexpected gem" and called Dion "a timeless, enormously versatile artist,"<ref>Taylor, Chuck.

[[Image:CelineDion-1Fille&4Types.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The cover and music of ''[[1 Fille & 4 Types]]'' presents Dion in one of her most relaxed states.]]

The Francophone album ''[[1 Fille & 4 Types]]'' (''1 Girl & 4 Guys'', [[2003 in music|2003]]), fared better than her first two comebacks, and showed Dion trying to distance herself from the "diva" image. She recruited [[Jean-Jacques Goldman]], Gildas Arzel, Eric Benzi, and Jacques Veneruso, with whom she had previously worked on ''[[S'il Suffisait d'Aimer]]'' and ''[[D'eux]]'' to help. The album's musical theme was fun and relaxation, and Dion herself has referred to it as "the album of pleasure." The cover showed Dion in a simple and relaxed manner, a contrast to the choreographed poses usually found on her album covers. The album achieved relative critical success: reviewer Stephen Erlwine of "All Music Guide" wrote that Dion was "getting back to pop basics and performing at a level unheard in a while."<ref>{{cite web | title= All Music Guide| work=Review--1 Fille & 4 Types|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:5uhqoatawijz|accessdate=November 20|accessyear= 2005}}</ref> 

Though her albums were relatively successful, signs of a decline began to appear in the poorer critical reception of ''[[The Collector's Series Volume One]]'' (2000), ''A New Day Has Come'' (2002), and ''One Heart'' (2003). The mass appeal of Dion's later works had declined due to the nature of the themes. Her songs received less airplay as radio became less embracing of balladeers like Dion, Carey and Houston, and now focused on more up-tempo, [[R&B]]/[[Hip hop music|Hip-hop]] songs.<ref>Gardner, Elysa.

===2003<U+2013>present: ''A New Day... Live in Las Vegas''===
[[Image:2004and080.jpg|thumb|275px|left|Dion performing "[[I'm Alive (Celine Dion song)|I'm Alive]]" during her show ''[[A New Day...]]'' in Las Vegas.]]
In early 2002 Dion had announced a three-year, 600-show contract to appear five nights a week in an entertainment extravaganza, ''[[A New Day...]]'', at [[Caesars Palace]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. This move was seen as "one of the smartest business decisions in years by any major recording artist" given the relatively poor performance of her current releases.<ref>Di Nunzio, Miriam. ''<nowiki>'A New Day'</nowiki>: Vegas gamble pays off for C<U+00E9>line Dion"''. Chicago Sun-Times, Mar 20, 2005.</ref> She conceived the idea for the show after seeing ''[[O (Cirque du Soleil)|O]]'' by Dragone early in her break from recording, and began on [[March 25]] [[2003]], in a 4000-seat arena designed for her show. The show, put together by [[Franco Dragone]], is a combination of dance, music, and visual effects. It includes Dion performing her biggest hits against an array of dancers and special effects.

Reviewer Mike Weatherford felt that, at first, Dion was not as relaxed as she should be, and at times, it was hard to find the singer among the excessive stage ornamentations and dancers. However, he noted that the show has become more enjoyable, due to Dion's improved stage-presence and simpler costumes.<ref>{{cite journal | author= Weatherford, Mike| title= Show review: As Dion feels more comfortable, her show improves| journal= Reviewjournal.com | year= 2004| url= http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Oct-01-Fri-2004/weekly/24865136.html}}</ref> 
The show has also been well-received by audiences, despite the complaints of expensive tickets; the show has sold out almost every night since its 2003 opening. According to ''[[Pollstar]]'', Dion had sold 322,000 tickets and grossed [[United States dollar|US$]]43.9 million in the first half of 2005, and by July 2005, she had sold out 315 out of 384 shows.<ref>{{cite news | title= Dion extends long Las Vegas stint| date=Sunday, [[19 September]] [[2004]] | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3670760.stm}}</ref>
By the end of 2005, Dion grossed over [[United States dollar|US$]]76 million, placing sixth on ''Billboard's Money Makers list for 2005''.<ref>{{cite web | title=Billboard.com | work= U2 Tops Billboard's Money Makers Chart| url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001882362| accessdate= January 25| accessyear= 2006}}</ref> ''A New Day...'' was the 6th biggest selling tour in America in 2006. <ref>{{cite web | title=You Tube| work= C<U+00E9>line Dion| url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=eaAi8V3k8YE| accessdate= October 20| accessyear= 2006}}</ref> Because of the show's success, Dion's contract was extended into [[2007]] for an undisclosed sum. On [[January 5]], [[2007]] it was announced that the show would be ending in December [[2007]], with tickets for the period after October [[2007]] going on sale from [[March 1]]<ref>{{cite web | title=BBC | work= C<U+00E9>line Dion is leaving Las Vegas |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6233473.stm | accessdate= January 5 | accessyear= 2007}}</ref> 

In 2005, Dion released her first comprehensive greatest hits album in French, ''[[On Ne Change Pas (album)|On Ne Change Pas]]'', which features three new songs, including a duet with [[Il Divo]] called "[[I Believe in You (Je Crois en Toi)|I Believe in You]]". In February 2007, Dion made her latest contribution to a tribute album, the song "I Knew I Loved You" (based on a theme from ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]''), the centerpiece track on the CD ''We All Love Ennio Morricone''.  She went on to perform this song at the [[2007 Academy Awards]] to honor [[Ennio Morricone]].

Dion's next French language album ''[[D'Elles]]'' was released on [[May 21]] [[2007]] in Europe and Brazil. It was released in Canada the following day. The first single "[[Et S'il N'en Restait Qu'une (Je Serais Celle-l<U+00E0>)]]" debuted at number-one on the French singles chart. Dion is also working on a new English album to be released in October 2007. <ref>{{cite web| title= What's Goin' On| work= D'elles Release Dates|url=http://www.celinedion.com/celinedion/english/whatsgoinon.cgi|accessdate=February 10|accessyear= 2007}}</ref>

Dion is one of pop music's most respected singers, and her vocal talents and expansive, [[coloratura soprano]] vocal range<ref>{{cite book | last = Martin | first = Bill | coauthors =  | title = Pro Secrets Of Heavy Rock Singing | publisher = Sanctuary Publishing | date = 2002 | pages = Page 9 | month = | id = ISBN 1-86074-437-0}}</ref> has influenced the singing styles of others such as [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Christina Aguilera]]. In [[MTV]]'s "[[22 Greatest Voices in Music]]" countdown, she placed ninth (sixth for a female), and she was also placed fourth in ''Cove Magazine''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> list of "The 100 Outstanding Pop Vocalists."<ref name=cove>{{cite web | title=Cove Magazine| work= The 100 Outstanding Pop Vocalists| url=http://covemagazine.com/100vocalists.html| accessdate=August 29|accessyear=2006}}</ref> In ''[[MuchMoreMusic]]''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> "Top 20 Divine Divas" program Dion ranked at number three, behind [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Mariah Carey]]. They also described her voice as "one of the most powerful vocal workouts ever to be recorded."<ref>"Top 20 Divine Divas" ''[[MuchMoreMusic]]''. 2006. Accessed June 15, 2006.</ref>

While industry officials note her for her vocal talents, Dion was often the subject of media ridicule, and was frequently impersonated on shows like ''[[MADtv]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[South Park]]'' for her Quebecois accent, as well as her conservative nature and on-stage movements. She is also heavily mocked in her home country of Canada on popular shows ''Royal Canadian Air Farce'' and ''This Hour Has 22 Minutes''. However, Dion seems unabashed by media ridicule: "I'm flattered when they take the time to impersonate you," she says. "I think it's a good sign."<ref name=vh1>{{cite web| title=VH1 | work= C<U+00E9>line Dion: Let's Talk About Success: The Singer Explains Her Career High-Points| url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1453531/04222002/dion_celine.jhtml| accessdate= December 19| accessyear= 2005}}</ref> She even invited [[Ana Gasteyer]], who parodied her on SNL, to appear on stage during one of her performances.

Dion is rarely the center of media controversies. However, in 2005, following the [[Hurricane Katrina]] disaster, she appeared on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' and tearfully criticized [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] regarding the [[Iraq War]] and his slow response in aiding the victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]]: "How come it's so easy to send planes in another country, to kill everyone in a second, to destroy lives?

==Other activities==
Dion became an [[entrepreneur]] with the establishment of her [[Franchising|franchise]] [[restaurant]] [[Nickels Grill & Bar|"Nickels"]] in 1990. She has since divested her interests in the chain and was no longer affiliated with ''Nickels'' as of 1997. She also has a range of eyewear and a line of perfume, manufactured by [[Coty, Inc.]]. In October 2004, Canada's national air carrier [[Air Canada]] hired Dion as part of the new promotional campaign as the airline unveiled new in-flight service products and new aircraft livery. "[[You and I (Celine Dion song)|You and I]]," the theme song sung by Dion, was written by an advertising executive working for Air Canada. 

Dion has actively supported many charity organizations worldwide. She has promoted the [[Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation]] (CCFF) since 1982 and became the foundation's National Celebrity Patron in 1993. She has an emotional attachment to the foundation; her niece Karine succumbed to the disease at the age of sixteen. In 2003, Dion joined a number of other celebrities, athletes and politicians including Josh Groban and Yolanda Adams to support "World Children's Day", a global fundraising effort sponsored by [[McDonald's]]. The effort raised money from over 100 countries and benefited many orphanages and children's health organizations. Dion has also been a major supporter of the T.J. Martell Foundation, the [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana Princess Of Wales]] Memorial Fund, and many health and education campaigns.

Dion has donated proceeds from selected performances of her Las Vegas show to various charitable causes.
