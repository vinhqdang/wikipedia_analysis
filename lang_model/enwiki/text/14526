'''Stephen''' ([[circa|c.]] 1092/6&nbsp;<U+2013> 25 October 1154), often referred to as '''Stephen of Blois''' ({{lang-fr|<U+00C9>tienne de Blois}}, Medieval French: ''Estienne de Blois''), was a grandson of [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]]. He was [[King of England]] from 1135 to his death, and also the [[Count of Boulogne]] by right of his wife. Stephen's reign was marked by [[the Anarchy]], a civil war with his cousin and rival, the [[Empress Matilda]].  He was succeeded by Matilda's son, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], the first of the [[House of Plantagenet|Angevin]] kings.

Stephen was born in the [[County of Blois]] in middle [[France]]; his father, Count [[Stephen II, Count of Blois|Stephen-Henry]], died while Stephen was still young, and he was brought up by his mother, [[Adela of Normandy|Adela]]. Placed into the court of his uncle, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], Stephen rose in prominence and was granted extensive lands. Stephen married [[Matilda of Boulogne]], inheriting additional estates in [[Kent]] and [[Boulogne]] that made the couple one of the wealthiest in England. Stephen narrowly escaped drowning with Henry I's son, [[William Adelin]], in the sinking of the ''[[White Ship]]'' in 1120; William's death left the succession of the English throne open to challenge. When Henry I died in 1135, Stephen quickly crossed the [[English Channel]] and with the help of his brother [[Henry of Blois]], a powerful ecclesiastic, took the throne, arguing that the preservation of order across the kingdom took priority over his earlier oaths to support the claim of Henry I's daughter, the [[Empress Matilda]].

The early years of Stephen's reign were largely successful, despite a series of attacks on his possessions in England and Normandy from [[David I of Scotland]], Welsh rebels and the Empress Matilda's husband, [[Geoffrey of Anjou]]. In 1138 the Empress's half-brother [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert of Gloucester]] rebelled against Stephen, threatening civil war. Together with his close advisor, [[Waleran de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Worcester|Waleron de Beaumont]], Stephen took firm steps to defend England, including arresting a powerful family of bishops. When the Empress and Robert invaded in 1139, however, Stephen was unable to rapidly crush the revolt, which took hold in the south-west of England. Captured at the [[Battle of Lincoln (1141)|battle of Lincoln]] in 1141, Stephen was abandoned by many of his followers and lost control of [[Normandy]]. Stephen was only freed after his wife and [[William of Ypres]], one of his military commanders, captured Robert at the [[rout of Winchester]], but the war dragged on for many years with neither side able to win an advantage.

Stephen became increasingly concerned with ensuring that his son, [[Eustace IV, Count of Boulogne|Eustace]], would inherit his throne after him. The king attempted to convince the church to agree to crown Eustace to reinforce his claim: Pope [[Pope Eugene III|Eugene III]] refused and Stephen found himself in a sequence of increasingly bitter arguments with his senior clergy. In 1153 the Empress's son, [[Henry II of England|Henry FitzEmpress]], invaded England and built an alliance of powerful regional barons to support his claim for the throne. The two armies met at [[Wallingford Castle|Wallingford]] but neither side's barons were keen to fight another pitched battle. Stephen began to examine a negotiated peace, a process hastened by the sudden death of Eustace. Stephen and Henry agreed the [[Treaty of Winchester]] later in the year, in which Stephen recognised Henry as his heir in exchange for peace, passing over [[William I, Count of Boulogne|William]], Stephen's second son. Stephen died the following year. Modern historians have extensively debated the extent to which Stephen's personality, external events or the weaknesses in the Norman state contributed to this prolonged period of civil war.

France in the 12th century was a loose collection of counties and smaller polities, under the minimal control of the king of France. The king's power was linked to his control of the rich province of [[<U+00CE>le-de-France (region)|<U+00CE>le-de-France]], just to the east of Stephen's home county of Blois.<ref>Duby, p.192; Barlow, p.111.</ref> In the west lay the three counties of [[Maine (province)|Maine]], [[Anjou]] and [[Touraine]], and to the north of Blois was the [[Duchy of Normandy]], from which Duke [[William the Conqueror|William]] had conquered England in 1066. William's children were still fighting over the collective Anglo-Norman inheritance.<ref>Carpenter, p.137.</ref> The rulers across this region spoke a similar language, albeit with regional dialects, followed the same religion and were closely interrelated; they were also highly competitive and frequently in conflict with one another for valuable territory and the castles that controlled them.<ref>Barlow, p.111; Koziol, p.17; Thompson, p.3.</ref>

Stephen had at least four brothers and one sister, along with two probable half-sisters.<ref name=King2010P5/> Stephen's eldest brother was [[William, Count of Sully|William]], who under normal circumstances would have inherited the title of count.<ref name=DavisP4/> William was probably [[intellectually disabled]], and Adela instead had the title passed over him to her second son, [[Theobald II, Count of Champagne|Theobald]], who went on to later acquire the county of [[Count of Champagne|Champagne]] as well as Blois and Chartres.<ref name=DavisP4/>{{#tag:ref|Stephen's brother William was described by chroniclers as being "deficient in intelligence&nbsp;... second rate"; he also took a strange oath in [[Chartres Cathedral]] to kill the local bishop.

===Relationship with Henry I===
[[Image:Adela syni.jpg|thumb|alt=A medieval family tree of Stephen's immediate family|A contemporary depiction of Stephen's family tree, with his mother [[Adela of Normandy|Adelin]] at the top, and, left to right, [[William, Count of Sully|William]], [[Theobald II, Count of Champagne|Theobald]] and Stephen]]
Stephen's early life was heavily influenced by his relationship with [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], his uncle and King of England. Henry seized power in England following the death of his elder brother [[William Rufus]]. In 1106 he invaded and captured the Duchy of Normandy, controlled by his eldest brother, [[Robert Curthose]], defeating Robert's army at the [[battle of Tinchebray]].<ref>Huscroft, p.69.</ref> Henry then found himself in conflict with [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] of France, who took the opportunity to declare Robert's son [[William Clito]] the Duke of Normandy.<ref name=HuscroftP70>Huscroft, p.70.</ref> Henry responded by forming a net of alliances with the western counties of France against Louis, resulting in a regional conflict that would last throughout Stephen's early life.<ref name=HuscroftP70/> Adela and Theobald allied themselves with Henry, and Stephen's mother decided to place him in Henry's court.<ref name=King2010P13>King (2010), p.13.</ref> Henry fought his next military campaign in Normandy from 1111 onwards, where rebels led by [[Robert of Bell<U+00EA>me, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury|Robert of Bell<U+00EA>me]] were opposing his rule. Stephen was probably with Henry during the military campaign of 1112, when he was knighted by the king, and was definitely present at court during the king's visit to the [[Abbey of Saint-Evroul]] in 1113.<ref>King (2010), p.11.</ref> Stephen probably first visited England in either 1113 or 1115, almost certainly as part of Henry's court.<ref name=King2010P13/>

Henry became a powerful patron to Stephen; Henry probably chose to support him because Stephen was part of his extended family and a regional ally, yet not sufficiently wealthy or powerful in his own right to represent a threat to either the king or his heir, [[William Adelin]].<ref name=DavisP10>Davis, p.10.</ref> As a third surviving son, even of an influential regional family, Stephen still needed the support of a powerful patron such as the king to progress in life.<ref name=DavisP10/> With Henry's support, Stephen rapidly began to accumulate lands and possessions. Following the battle of Tinchebray in 1106, Henry confiscated the County of Mortain from William, the [[Count of Mortain]], and the [[Honour of Eye]], a large lordship previously owned by [[Robert Malet]].<ref name=DavisKingP13>Davis, p.7; King (2010), p.13.</ref> In 1113, Stephen was granted both the title and the honour, although without the lands previously held by William in England.<ref name=DavisKingP13/> The gift of the [[Honour of Lancaster]] also followed after it was confiscated by Henry from [[Roger the Poitevin]].<ref name=DavisP8>Davis, p.8.</ref> Stephen was also given lands in [[Alen<U+00E7>on]] in southern Normandy by Henry, but the local Normans rebelled, seeking assistance from [[Fulk IV, Count of Anjou|Fulk]], the Count of Anjou.<ref>King (2010), p.15.</ref> Stephen and his older brother Theobald were comprehensively beaten in the subsequent campaign, which culminated in the [[battle of Alen<U+00E7>on]], and the territories were not recovered.<ref>Davis, p.6, King (2010), p.15.</ref>

Finally, the king arranged for Stephen to marry [[Matilda of Boulogne|Matilda]] in 1125, the daughter and only heiress of the [[Count of Boulogne]], who owned both the important continental port of [[Boulogne]] and vast estates in the north-west and south-east of England.<ref name=DavisP8/> In 1127, William Clito, a potential claimant to the English throne, seemed likely to become the [[Count of Flanders]]; Stephen was sent by the king on a mission to prevent this, and in the aftermath of his successful election, William Clito attacked Stephen's lands in neighbouring Boulogne in retaliation.<ref>King (2010), pp.32<U+2013>33.</ref> Eventually a truce was declared, and William Clito died the following year.<ref>King (2010), p.34.</ref>

===The White Ship and succession===
[[Image:WhiteShipSinking.jpg|thumb|alt=A medieval picture of a sinking ship|An early 14th-century depiction of the ''[[White Ship]]'' sinking in 1120]]
In 1120, the English political landscape changed dramatically. Three hundred passengers embarked on the ''[[White Ship]]'' to travel from [[Barfleur]] in Normandy to England, including the heir to the throne, William Adelin, and many other senior nobles.<ref>Bradbury, p.1.</ref> Stephen had intended to sail on the same ship but changed his mind at the last moment and got off to await another vessel, either out of concern for overcrowding on board the ship, or because he was suffering from [[diarrhoea]].<ref name=BradburyP2>Bradbury, p.2.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Contemporary chroniclers varied in their explanation for Stephen's absence from the ''White Ship'', [[Orderic Vitalis|Orderic]] gives his illness as the reason.<ref name=BradburyP2/>|group="nb"}} The ship foundered en route, and all but two of the passengers died, including William Adelin.<ref name="Bradbury, p.3">Bradbury, p.3.</ref>{{#tag:ref|There has been extensive speculation as to the cause of the sinking of the ''White Ship''. Some theories centre on overcrowding, while others blame excessive drinking by the ship's master and crew.<ref name=BradburyP2/>|group="nb"}}

With Adelin dead, the inheritance to the English throne was thrown into doubt. Rules of succession in western Europe at the time were uncertain; in some parts of France, male [[primogeniture]], in which the eldest child would inherit a title, was becoming more popular.<ref name=BarlowP162>Barlow, p.162.</ref> It was also traditional for the King of France to crown his successor whilst he himself was still alive, making the intended line of succession relatively clear, but this was not the case in England. In other parts of Europe, including Normandy and England, the tradition was for lands to be divided up, with the eldest son taking patrimonial lands<U+2014>usually considered to be the most valuable<U+2014>and younger sons being given smaller, or more recently acquired, partitions or estates.<ref name=BarlowP162/> The problem was further complicated by the sequence of unstable Anglo-Norman successions over the previous sixty years<U+2014>[[William the Conqueror]] had gained England by force, [[William Rufus]] and [[Robert Curthose]] had fought a war between them to establish their inheritance, and Henry had only acquired control of Normandy by force. There had been no peaceful, uncontested successions.<ref>Huscroft, pp.65, 69<U+2013>71; Carpenter, p.124.</ref> 

With William Adelin dead, Henry had only one other legitimate child, [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]], but as a woman she was at a substantial political disadvantage.<ref name="Bradbury, p.3"/> Despite Henry taking a second wife, Queen [[Adeliza of Louvain|Adeliza]], it became increasingly unlikely that Henry would have another legitimate son and instead he looked to Matilda as his intended heir.<ref>Bradbury, pp.6<U+2013>7.</ref> Matilda had been married to [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]], the Holy Roman Emperor, which gave her the title of Empress, but her husband died in 1125 and she was remarried in 1128 to [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey]], the [[Count of Anjou]], whose lands bordered the Duchy of Normandy.<ref>Barlow, p.160.</ref> Geoffrey was unpopular with the Anglo-Norman elite: as an [[Angevins|Angevin]] ruler, he was a traditional enemy of the Normans.<ref>Barlow, p.161.</ref> At the same time, tensions continued to grow as a result of Henry's domestic policies, in particular the high level of revenue he was raising to pay for his various wars.<ref>Carpenter, p.160.</ref> Conflict was curtailed, however, by the power of the king's personality and reputation.<ref>Carpenter, p.161; Stringer, p.8.</ref>

Henry attempted to build up a base of political support for Matilda in both England and Normandy, demanding that his court take [[oath]]s first in 1127, and then again in 1128 and 1131, to recognise Matilda as his immediate successor and recognise her descendants as the rightful ruler after her.<ref>Bradbury, p.9; Barlow, p.161.</ref> Stephen was amongst those who took this oath in 1127.<ref>King (2010), pp.30<U+2013>31; Barlow, p.161.</ref> Nonetheless, relations between Henry, Matilda and Geoffrey became increasingly strained towards the end of the king's life. Matilda and Geoffrey suspected that they lacked genuine support in England, and proposed to Henry in 1135 that the king should hand over the royal castles in Normandy to Matilda whilst he was still alive and insist on the Norman nobility swearing immediate allegiance to her, thereby giving the couple a much more powerful position after Henry's death.<ref>King (2010), pp.38<U+2013>39.</ref> Henry angrily declined to do so, probably out of a concern that Geoffrey would try to seize power in Normandy somewhat earlier than intended.<ref>King (2010), p.38; Crouch (2008a), p.162.</ref> A fresh rebellion broke out in southern Normandy, and Geoffrey and Matilda intervened militarily on behalf of the rebels.<ref name=BarlowP162/> In the middle of this confrontation, Henry unexpectedly fell ill and died near [[Lyon]]s.<ref>Barlow, p.161.</ref>

==Succession (1135)==
[[Image:StepanAngl.jpg|thumb|alt=A medieval picture of King Stephen being crowned|A 13th century depiction of the coronation of Stephen, by [[Matthew Paris]]]]
Stephen was a well established figure in Anglo-Norman society by 1135. He was extremely wealthy, well-mannered and liked by his peers; he was also considered a man capable of firm action.<ref name=King2010P301>King (2010), p.301.</ref> Chroniclers recorded that despite his wealth and power he was a modest and easy-going leader, happy to sit with his men and servants, casually laughing and eating with them.<ref name=King2010P301/> He was very pious, both in terms of his observance of religious rituals and his personal generosity to the church.<ref>Crouch (2002), pp.279-281.</ref> Stephen also had a personal [[Augustinians|Augustine]] confessor appointed to him by the Archbishop of Canterbury, who implemented a [[Penance|penitential regime]] for him, and Stephen encouraged the new order of [[Cistercians]] to form abbeys on his estates, winning him additional allies within the church.<ref>Barlow, p.164.</ref> Rumours of his father's cowardice during the First Crusade, however, continued to circulate, and a desire to avoid the same reputation may have influenced some of Stephen's rasher military actions.<ref>Barlow, p.167.</ref> His wife, Matilda, played a major role in running their vast English estates, which contributed to the couple being the second-richest lay household in the country after the king.<ref>King (2010), p.24.</ref> The landless Flemish nobleman [[William of Ypres]] had joined Stephen's household in 1133, alongside [[Faramus of Boulogne]], a Flemish relative and friend of Matilda's.<ref>Bennett, pp.102, 106; Amt, p.86.</ref>

Meanwhile, Stephen's younger brother Henry of Blois had also risen to power under Henry I. Henry of Blois had become a [[Cluny Abbey|Cluniac]] monk and followed Stephen to England, where the king made him Abbot of [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]], the richest abbey in England.<ref name=King2010P29>King (2010), p.29.</ref> The king then appointed him [[Bishop of Winchester]], one of the richest bishoprics, allowing him to retain Glastonbury as well.<ref name=King2010P29/> The combined revenues of the two positions made Henry of Winchester the second-richest man in England after the king.<ref name=King2010P29/> Henry of Winchester was keen to reverse what he perceived as encroachment by the Norman kings on the rights of the church.<ref>Stringer, p.66.</ref> The Norman kings had traditionally exercised a great deal of power and autonomy over the church within their territories. From the 1040s onwards, however, successive popes had put forward a reforming message that emphasised the importance of the church being "governed more coherently and more hierarchically from the centre" and established "its own sphere of authority and jurisdiction, separate from and independent of that of the lay ruler", in the words of historian Richard Huscroft.<ref>Huscroft, p.190.</ref>

[[Image:HenryBlois.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A medieval picture of Henry of Blois|Contemporary depiction of Stephen's brother [[Henry of Blois]], with his bishop's [[Crosier|staff]] and [[Ecclesiastical ring|ring]]]]
When news began to spread of Henry I's death, many of the potential claimants to the throne were not well placed to respond. Geoffrey and Matilda were in Anjou, rather awkwardly supporting the rebels in their campaign against the royal army, which included a number of Matilda's supporters such as Robert of Gloucester.<ref name=BarlowP162/> Many of these barons had taken an oath to stay in Normandy until the late king was properly buried, which prevented them from returning to England.<ref>Crouch (2002), p.246.</ref> Stephen's elder brother Theobald was further south still, in Blois.<ref name="Barlow, pp.163<U+2013>4">Barlow, pp.163<U+2013>164.</ref> Stephen, however, was in Bolougne, and when news reached him of Henry's death he left for England, accompanied by his military household. Robert of Gloucester had garrisoned the ports of Dover and Canterbury and some accounts suggest that they refused Stephen access when he first arrived.<ref>Barlow, p.163; King (2010), p.43.</ref> Nonetheless Stephen probably reached his own estate on the edge of London by 8 December and over the next week he began to seize power in England.<ref>King (2010), p.43.</ref>

The crowds in London traditionally claimed a right to elect the king of England, and they proclaimed Stephen the new monarch, believing that he would grant the city new rights and privileges in return.<ref>King (2010), p.45.</ref> Henry of Blois delivered the support of the church to Stephen: Stephen was able to advance to [[Winchester]], where [[Roger of Salisbury|Roger]], who was both the [[Bishop of Salisbury]] and the [[Lord Chancellor]], instructed the royal treasury to be handed over to Stephen.<ref>King (2010), pp.45<U+2013>46.</ref> On 15 December, Henry delivered an agreement under which Stephen would grant extensive freedoms and liberties to the church, in exchange for the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Papal Legate supporting his succession to the throne.<ref>King (2010), p.46.</ref> There was the slight problem of the religious oath that Stephen had taken to support the Empress Matilda, but Henry convincingly argued that the late king had been wrong to insist that his court take the oath.<ref name=Crouch2002P247>Crouch (2002), p.247.</ref> Furthermore, the late king had only insisted on that oath to protect the stability of the  kingdom, and in light of the chaos that might now ensue, Stephen would be justified in ignoring it.<ref name=Crouch2002P247/> Henry was also able to persuade [[Hugh Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk|Hugh Bigod]], the late king's royal steward, to swear that the king had changed his mind about the succession on his deathbed, nominating Stephen instead.<ref name=Crouch2002P247/>{{#tag:ref|Modern historians, such as Edmund King, doubt that Hugh Bigod was being truthful in his account.<ref name=King2010P52>King (2010), p.52.</ref>|group="nb"}} Stephen's coronation was held a week later at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 26 December.<ref>King (2010), p.47.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Opinions vary over the degree to which Stephen's acquisition of power resembled a [[coup]].

Meanwhile, the Norman nobility gathered at [[Le Neubourg]] to discuss declaring Theobald king, probably following the news that Stephen was gathering support in England.<ref>King (2010), pp.46<U+2013>47.</ref> The Normans argued that the count, as the eldest grandson of William the Conqueror, had the most valid claim over the kingdom and the duchy, and was certainly preferable to Matilda.<ref name="Barlow, pp.163<U+2013>4"/> Theobald met with the Norman barons and Robert of Gloucester at [[Lisieux]] on 21 December but their discussions were interrupted by the sudden news from England that Stephen's coronation was to occur the next day.<ref>King (2010), p.47; Barlow, p.163.</ref> Theobald then agreed to the Normans' proposal that he be made king, only to find that his former support immediately ebbed away: the barons were not prepared to support the division of England and Normandy by opposing Stephen.<ref>Barlow, p.163.</ref> Stephen subsequently financially compensated Theobald, who in return remained in Blois and supported his brother's succession.<ref>Barlow, p.163; Carpenter, p.168.</ref>{{#tag:ref|The events in Normandy are less well recorded than elsewhere, and the exact sequence of events less certain. Historian Robert Helmerichs, for example, describes some of the inconsistencies in these accounts. Some historians, including David Crouch and Helmerichs, argue that Theobald and Stephen had probably already made a private deal to seize the throne when Henry died.<ref>Helmerichs, pp.136<U+2013>137; Crouch (2002), p.245.</ref>|group="nb"}}

Stephen's new Anglo-Norman kingdom had been shaped by the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066, followed by the [[Norman invasion of Wales|Norman expansion into south Wales]] over the coming years.<ref>Barlow, p.86.</ref> Both the kingdom and duchy were dominated by a small number of major barons who owned lands on both sides of the [[English Channel]], with the lesser barons beneath them usually having more localised holdings.<ref>Barlow, pp.91<U+2013>92.</ref> The extent to which lands and positions should be passed down through hereditary right or by the gift of the king was still uncertain, and tensions around this issue had grown during the reign of [[Henry I of England|Henry I]]. Certainly lands in Normandy, passed by hereditary right, were usually considered more important to major barons than those in England, where their possession was less certain. Henry had increased the authority and capabilities of the central royal administration, often bringing in "[[List of Henry I's new men|new men]]" to fulfil key positions rather than using the established nobility.<ref>Carpenter, p.159.</ref> In the process he had been able to maximise revenues and contain expenditures, resulting in a healthy surplus and a famously large treasury, but also increasing political tensions.<ref>Carpenter, p.155.</ref>{{#tag:ref|The nature of Henry's administration and the links between England and Normandy have been hotly debated by historians. [[C.

By contrast, [[David Carpenter (historian)|David Carpenter]] draws more attention to the pressures on the Anglo-Norman system during Henry's reign and the strains that built up during the period.

Stephen had to intervene in the north of England immediately after his coronation.<ref name=King2010P52/> [[David I of Scotland]] invaded the north on the news of Henry's death, taking [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and other key strongholds.<ref name=King2010P52/> Northern England was a disputed territory at this time, with the Scottish kings laying a traditional claim to [[Cumberland]], and David also claiming [[Northumbria]] by virtue of his marriage to the daughter of the former Anglo-Saxon earl [[Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria|Waltheof]].<ref name="Carpenter, p.165">Carpenter, p.165.</ref> Stephen rapidly marched north with an army and met David at [[Durham]].<ref name=King2010P53>King (2010), p.53.</ref> An agreement was made under which David would return most of the territory he had taken, with the exception of Carlisle. In return, Stephen confirmed David's son [[Henry, Earl of Northumbria|Prince Henry]]'s possessions in England, including the [[Earl of Huntingdon|Earldom of Huntingdon]].<ref name=King2010P53/>

Returning south, Stephen held his first royal court at Easter 1136.<ref>King (2010), p.57.</ref> A wide range of nobles gathered at Westminster for the event, including many of the Anglo-Norman barons and most of the higher officials of the church.<ref>King (2010), pp.57<U+2013>60; Davis, p.22.</ref> Stephen issued a new royal charter, confirming the promises he had made to the church, promising to reverse Henry's policies on the [[royal forest]]s and to reform any abuses of the royal legal system.<ref>Carpenter, p.167.</ref> Stephen portrayed himself as the natural successor to Henry I's policies, and reconfirmed the existing seven earldoms in the kingdom on their existing holders.<ref>White (2000), p.78.</ref> The Easter court was a lavish event, and a large amount of money was spent on the event itself, clothes and gifts.<ref>Crouch (2002), p.250.</ref> Stephen gave out grants of land and favours to those present, and endowed numerous church foundations with land and privileges.<ref>Crouch (2008a), p.29; King (2010), pp.54<U+2013>55.</ref> Stephen's accession to the throne still needed to be ratified by the Pope, however, and Henry of Blois appears to have been responsible for ensuring that testimonials of support were sent both from Stephen's elder brother Theobald and from the French king Louis VI, to whom Stephen represented a useful balance to Angevin power in the north of France.<ref>Crouch (2008b), pp.46<U+2013>47.</ref> Pope [[Pope Innocent II|Innocent II]] confirmed Stephen as king by letter later that year, and Stephen's advisers circulated copies widely around England to demonstrate Stephen's legitimacy.<ref>Crouch (2002), pp.248<U+2013>249.</ref>

Troubles continued across Stephen's kingdom. After the Welsh victory at the [[battle of Llwchwr]] in January 1136 and the successful ambush of [[Richard Fitz Gilbert de Clare]] in April, south Wales rose in rebellion, starting in east [[Glamorgan]] and rapidly spreading across the rest of south Wales during 1137.<ref>Carpenter, pp.164<U+2013>165; Crouch (1998), p.258.</ref> [[Owain Gwynedd]] and [[Gruffydd ap Rhys]] successfully captured considerable territories, including [[Carmarthen Castle]].<ref name="Carpenter, p.165"/> Stephen responded by sending Richard's brother Baldwin and the Marcher Lord Robert Fitz Harold of Ewyas into Wales to pacify the region. Neither mission was particularly successful and by the end of 1137 the king appears to have abandoned attempts to put down the rebellion. Historian [[David Crouch (historian)|David Crouch]] suggests that Stephen effectively "bowed out of Wales" around this time to concentrate on his other problems.<ref>Crouch (1998), pp.260, 262.</ref> Meanwhile, Stephen had put down two revolts in the south-west led by [[Baldwin de Redvers]] and Robert of Bampton; Baldwin was released after his capture and travelled to Normandy, where he became an increasingly vocal critic of the king.<ref>Bradbury, pp.27<U+2013>32.</ref>

The security of Normandy was also a concern. Geoffrey of Anjou invaded in early 1136 and, after a temporary truce, invaded later the same year, raiding and burning estates rather than trying to hold the territory.<ref name=BarlowP168>Barlow, p.168.</ref> Events in England meant that Stephen was unable to travel to Normandy himself, so [[Waleran de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Worcester|Waleran de Beaumont]], appointed by Stephen as the lieutenant of Normandy, and Theobald led the efforts to defend the duchy.<ref>Crouch (2008b), pp.46<U+2013>47; Crouch (2002), p.252.</ref> Stephen himself only returned to the duchy in 1137, where he met with Louis VI and Theobald to agree to an informal regional alliance, probably brokered by Henry, to counter the growing Angevin power in the region.<ref>Crouch (2008b), p.47.</ref> As part of this deal, Louis recognised Stephen's son Eustace as Duke of Normandy in exchange for Eustace giving fealty to the French king.<ref>Barlow, p.168;</ref> Stephen was less successful, however, in regaining the Argentan province along the Normandy and Anjou border, which Geoffrey had taken at the end of 1135.<ref>Davis, p.27.</ref> Stephen formed an army to retake it, but the frictions between his Flemish mercenary forces led by William of Ypres and the local Norman barons resulted in a battle between the two halves of his army.<ref>Davis, p.27; Bennett, p.102.</ref> The Norman forces then deserted the king, forcing Stephen to give up his campaign.<ref>Davis, p.28.</ref> Stephen agreed to another truce with Geoffrey, promising to pay him 2,000 [[mark (money)|marks]] a year in exchange for peace along the Norman borders.<ref name=BarlowP168/>{{#tag:ref|[[Geoffrey of Anjou]] appears to have agreed to this at least partially because of the pressure of the combined Anglo-Norman-French regional alliance against him.<ref>Crouch (2008b), p.50; Barlow, p.168.</ref>|group="nb"}}{{#tag:ref|Medieval financial figures are notoriously hard to convert into modern currency; for comparison, 2,000 marks equated to around <U+00A3>1,333 in a period in which a major castle rebuilding project might cost around <U+00A3>1,115.<ref>Pettifer, p.257.</ref>|group="nb"}}

Stephen's relationship with the church became gradually more complex. The royal charter of 1136 had promised to review the ownership of all the lands that had been taken by the crown from the church since 1087, but these estates were now typically owned by nobles.<ref name=BarlowP168/> Henry of Blois's claims, in his role as Abbot of Glastonbury, to extensive lands in Devon resulted in considerable local unrest.<ref name=BarlowP168/> In 1136, Archbishop of Canterbury [[William de Corbeil]] died. Stephen responded by seizing his personal wealth, which caused some discontent amongst the senior clergy.<ref name=BarlowP168/> Stephen's brother Henry wanted to succeed to the post, but Stephen instead supported [[Theobald of Bec]], who was eventually appointed, while the papacy named Henry [[papal legate]], possibly as consolation for not receiving Canterbury.<ref>King (2010), p.317.</ref>

Stephen's first few years as king can be interpreted in different ways. Seen positively, Stephen stabilised the northern border with Scotland, contained Geoffrey's attacks on Normandy, was at peace with Louis VI, enjoyed good relations with the church and had the broad support of his barons.<ref>Barlow, pp.165, 167; Stringer, pp.17<U+2013>18.</ref> There were significant underlying problems, nonetheless. The north of England was now controlled by David and Prince Henry, Stephen had abandoned Wales, the fighting in Normandy had considerably destabilised the duchy, and an increasing number of barons felt that Stephen had given them neither the lands nor the titles they felt they deserved or were owed.<ref>Barlow, p.168; Crouch (1998), p.264; Carpenter, p.168.</ref> Stephen was also rapidly running out of money: Henry's considerable treasury had been emptied by 1138 due to the costs of running Stephen's more lavish court, and the need to raise and maintain his mercenary armies fighting in England and Normandy.<ref name=CarpenterP169>Carpenter, p.169.</ref>

Stephen was attacked on several fronts during 1138. First, [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert of Gloucester]] rebelled against the king, starting the descent into civil war in England.<ref name=CarpenterP169/> An illegitimate son of Henry I and the half-brother of the Empress Matilda, Robert was one of the most powerful Anglo-Norman barons, controlling estates in Normandy as well as the [[Earl of Gloucester|Earldom of Gloucester]].

Anglo-Norman warfare during the reign of Stephen was characterised by [[Attrition warfare|attrition]]al military campaigns, in which commanders tried to seize key enemy castles in order to allow them to take control of their adversaries' territory and ultimately win a slow, strategic victory.<ref name=BradburyP71>Bradbury, p.71.</ref> The armies of the period centred on bodies of mounted, armoured [[knight]]s, supported by [[infantry]] and [[crossbow]]men.<ref>Bradbury, p.74.</ref> These forces were either [[feudal]] levies, drawn up by local nobles for a limited period of service during a campaign or, increasingly, mercenaries, who were expensive but more flexible and often more skilled. These armies, however, were ill-suited to besieging castles, whether the older [[motte-and-bailey]] designs or the newer, stone-built [[keep]]s. Existing siege engines were significantly less powerful than the later [[trebuchet]] designs, giving defenders a substantial advantage over attackers. As a result, slow sieges to starve defenders out, or [[Mining (military)|mining operations]] to undermine walls, tended to be preferred by commanders over direct assaults.<ref name=BradburyP71/> Occasionally pitched battles were fought between armies but these were considered highly risky endeavours and were usually avoided by prudent commanders.<ref name=BradburyP71/> The cost of warfare had risen considerably in the first part of the 12th century, and adequate supplies of ready cash were increasingly proving important in the success of campaigns.<ref>Stringer, pp.24<U+2013>25.</ref>

Stephen's personal qualities as a military leader focused on his skill in personal combat, his capabilities in siege warfare and a remarkable ability to move military forces quickly over relatively long distances.<ref>Stringer, pp.15<U+2013>16; Davis, p.127.</ref> In response to the revolts and invasions, Stephen rapidly undertook several military campaigns, focusing primarily on England rather than Normandy. His wife Matilda was sent to Kent with ships and resources from Boulogne, with the task of retaking the key port of [[Dover]], under Robert's control.<ref name=BarlowP169/> A small number of Stephen's household knights were sent north to help the fight against the Scots, where David's forces were defeated later that year at the [[battle of the Standard]] in August by the forces of [[Thurstan]], the [[Archbishop of York]].<ref name=CarpenterP166>Carpenter, p.166.</ref> Despite this victory, however, David still occupied most of the north.<ref name=CarpenterP166/> Stephen himself went west in an attempt to regain control of [[Gloucestershire]], first striking north into the [[Welsh Marches]], taking [[Hereford]] and [[Shrewsbury]], before heading south to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].<ref name=BarlowP169/> The town of [[Bristol]] itself proved too strong for him, and Stephen contented himself with raiding and pillaging the surrounding area.<ref name=BarlowP169/> The rebels appear to have expected Robert to intervene with support that year, but he remained in Normandy throughout, trying to persuade the Empress Matilda to invade England herself.<ref>Bradbury, p.67.</ref> Dover finally surrendered to the queen's forces later in the year.<ref name=Crouch2002P256>Crouch (2002), p.256.</ref>

Stephen's military campaign in England had progressed well, and historian David Crouch describes it as "a military achievement of the first rank".<ref name=Crouch2002P256/> The king took the opportunity of his military advantage to forge a peace agreement with Scotland.<ref name=Crouch2002P256/> Stephen's wife Matilda was sent to negotiate another agreement between Stephen and David, called the [[Treaty of Durham (1139)|treaty of Durham]]; Northumbria and Cumbria would effectively be granted to David and his son [[Henry, Earl of Northumbria|Prince Henry]], in exchange for their fealty and future peace along the border.<ref name=CarpenterP166/> Unfortunately, the powerful [[Ranulf le Meschin, 3rd Earl of Chester|Ranulf, Earl of Chester]], considered himself to hold the traditional rights to Carlisle and Cumberland and was extremely displeased to see them being given to the Scots.<ref name=DavisP50/> Nonetheless, Stephen could now focus his attention on the anticipated invasion of England by Robert and Matilda's forces.<ref>Carpenter, p.170.</ref>

===Road to civil war (1139)===
[[Image:Great Seal of King Stephen.jpg|thumb|alt=A drawing of King Stephen's Great Seal|Stephen's [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]]]]
Stephen prepared for the [[Angevins|Angevin]] invasion by creating a number of additional [[List of earldoms|earldoms]].<ref>Bradbury, p.52.</ref> Only a handful of earldoms had existed under Henry I and these had been largely symbolic in nature. Stephen created many more, filling them with men he considered to be loyal, capable military commanders, and in the more vulnerable parts of the country assigning them new lands and additional executive powers.<ref>Bradbury, p.70.</ref>{{#tag:ref|R. Davis and W. L. Warren argue that the typical earldom involved the delegation of considerable royal powers; Keith Stringer and Judith Green capture the current consensus that the degree of delegated powers followed the degree of threat, and that perhaps less powers in total were delegated than once thought.<ref>White (2000), pp.76<U+2013>77.</ref>|group="nb"}} Stephen appears to have had several objectives in mind, including both ensuring the loyalty of his key supporters by granting them these honours, and improving his defences in key parts of the kingdom. Stephen was heavily influenced by his principal advisor, [[Waleran de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Worcester|Waleran de Beaumont]], the twin brother of [[Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester|Robert of Leicester]]. The Beaumont twins and their younger brother and cousins received the majority of these new earldoms.<ref>Barlow, pp.171<U+2013>172; Crouch (2008a), p.29.</ref> From 1138 onwards, Stephen gave them the earldoms of [[Earl of Worcester|Worcester]], [[Earldom of Leicester|Leicester]], [[Earl of Hereford|Hereford]], [[Earldom of Warwick|Warwick]] and [[Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], which<U+2014>especially when combined with the possessions of Stephen's new ally, Prince Henry, in Cumberland and Northumbria<U+2014>created a wide block of territory to act as a [[buffer zone]] between the troubled south-west, [[Chester]] and the rest of the kingdom.<ref>Barlow, p.172.</ref> With their new lands, the power of the Beamounts grew to the point where David Crouch suggests that it became "dangerous to be anything other than a friend of Waleran" at Stephen's court.<ref>Crouch (2008a), p.43.</ref>

Stephen took steps to remove a group of bishops he regarded as a threat to his rule. The royal administration under Henry I had been headed by [[Roger of Salisbury|Roger]], the [[Bishop of Salisbury]], supported by Roger's nephews, [[Alexander of Lincoln|Alexander]] and [[Nigel (Bishop of Ely)|Nigel]], the Bishops of [[Bishop of Lincoln|Lincoln]] and [[Bishop of Ely|Ely]] respectively, and Roger's son, [[Roger le Poer]], who was the [[Lord Chancellor]].<ref>Davis, p.31.</ref> These bishops were powerful landowners as well as ecclesiastical rulers, and they had begun to build new castles and increase the size of their military forces, leading Stephen to suspect that they were about to defect to the Empress Matilda. Roger and his family were also enemies of Waleran, who disliked their control of the royal administration. In June 1139, Stephen held his court in Oxford, where a fight between [[Alan, 1st Earl of Richmond|Alan of Britanny]] and Roger's men broke out, an incident probably deliberately created by Stephen.<ref name=DavisP32>Davis, p.32.</ref> Stephen responded by demanding that Roger and the other bishops surrender all of their castles in England. This threat was backed up by the arrest of the bishops, with the exception of Nigel who had taken refuge in [[Devizes Castle]]; the bishop only surrendered after Stephen besieged the castle and threatened to execute Roger le Poer.<ref>Yoshitake, p.98.</ref> The remaining castles were then surrendered to the king.<ref name=DavisP32/>{{#tag:ref|The impact of these arrests on the efficacy of the subsequent royal administration and the loyalty of the wider English church has been much discussed. Kenji Yoshitake represents the current academic consensus when he notes that the impact of the arrests "was not serious", placing the beginning of the disintegration of the royal government at the subsequent battle of Lincoln.<ref>Yoshitake, pp.97-98; 108-109.</ref>|group="nb"}}

Stephen's brother, Henry of Blois, was alarmed by this, both as a matter of principle, since Stephen had previously agreed in 1135 to respect the freedoms of the church, and more pragmatically because he himself had recently built six castles and had no desire to be treated in the same way.<ref name=BarlowP173>Barlow, p.173.</ref> As the papal legate, he summoned the king to appear before an ecclesiastical council to answer for the arrests and seizure of property. Henry asserted the Church<U+2019>s right to investigate and judge all charges against members of the clergy.<ref name=BarlowP173/> Stephen sent [[Aubrey de Vere II|Aubrey de Vere]] as his spokesman to the council, who argued that Roger of Salisbury had been arrested not as a bishop, but rather in his role as a baron who had been preparing to change his support to the Empress Matilda. The king was supported by [[Hugh of Amiens|Hugh]], [[Archbishop of Rouen]], who challenged the bishops to show how [[canon law]] entitled them to build or hold castles. Aubrey threatened that Stephen would complain to the pope that he was being harassed by the English church, and the council let the matter rest following an unsuccessful appeal to Rome.<ref name=BarlowP173/> The incident successfully removed any military threat from the bishops, but it may have damaged Stephen's relationship with the senior clergy, and in particular with his brother Henry.<ref>Davis, p.34; Barlow, p.173.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Keith Stringer argues that Stephen "was surely right" to seize the castles, and that the act was a "calculated display of royal masterfulness"; Jim Bradbury and Frank Barlow praise the military soundness of the tactic. David Carpenter and R. Davis, however, observe that Stephen had ended up breaking his promises to the Church, was forced to appear before a church court, and damaged his relationship with Henry of Blois, which would have grave implications in 1141.<ref>Stringer, p.20; Bradbury, p.61; Davis, p.35; Barlow, p.173; Carpenter, p.170.</ref>|group="nb"}}

[[Image:Matylda.jpg|thumb|130px|alt=A medieval painting of the Empress Matilda|Contemporary depiction of the [[Empress Matilda]]]]
The Angevin invasion finally arrived in 1139. [[Baldwin de Redvers, 1st Earl of Devon|Baldwin de Redvers]] crossed over from Normandy to [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] in August in an initial attempt to capture a port to receive the Empress Matilda's invading army, but Stephen's forces forced him to retreat into the south-west.<ref name=DavisP39>Davis, p.39.</ref> The following month, however, the Empress was invited by the Dowager Queen Adeliza to land at [[Arundel]] instead, and on 30 September Robert of Gloucester and the Empress arrived in England with 140 knights.<ref name=DavisP39/>{{#tag:ref|Edmund King disagrees about that the Empress received an invitation to [[Arundel Castle|Arundel]], arguing that she appeared unexpectedly.<ref>King (2010), p.116.</ref>|group="nb"}} The Empress stayed at [[Arundel Castle]], whilst Robert marched north-west to [[Wallingford Castle|Wallingford]] and Bristol, hoping to raise support for the rebellion and to link up with [[Miles of Gloucester]], a capable military leader who took the opportunity to renounce his fealty to the king.<ref>Davis, p.40.</ref> Stephen promptly moved south, besieging Arundel and trapping Matilda inside the castle.<ref name=BradburyP78>Bradbury, p.78.</ref>

Stephen then agreed to a truce proposed by his brother, Henry of Blois; the full details of the truce are not known, but the results were that Stephen first released Matilda from the siege and then allowed her and her household of knights to be escorted to the south-west, where they were reunited with Robert of Gloucester.<ref name=BradburyP78/> The reasoning behind Stephen's decision to release his rival remains unclear. Contemporary chroniclers suggested that Henry argued that it would be in Stephen's own best interests to release the Empress and concentrate instead on attacking Robert, and Stephen may have seen Robert, not the Empress, as his main opponent at this point in the conflict.<ref name=BradburyP78/> Stephen also faced a military dilemma at Arundel<U+2014>the castle was considered almost impregnable, and he may have been worried that he was tying down his army in the south whilst Robert roamed freely in the west.<ref>Bradbury, p.79.</ref> Another theory is that Stephen released Matilda out of a sense of [[chivalry]]; Stephen was certainly known for having a generous, courteous personality and women were not normally expected to be targeted in Anglo-Norman warfare.<ref>Gillingham (1994), p.31.</ref>{{#tag:ref|"[[Chivalry]]" was firmly established as a principle in Anglo-Norman warfare by the time of Stephen; it was not considered appropriate or normal to execute elite prisoners and, as historian John Gillingham observes, neither Stephen nor the Empress Matilda did so except where the opponent had already breached the norms of military conduct.<ref>Gillingham (1994), pp.49<U+2013>50.</ref>|group="nb"}}

Having released the Empress, Stephen focused on pacifying the south-west of England.<ref>Bradbury, p.82; Davis, p.47.</ref> Although there had been few new defections to the Empress, his enemies now controlled a compact block of territory stretching out from Gloucester and Bristol south-west into Devon and Cornwall, west into the Welsh Marches and east as far as Oxford and Wallingford, threatening London.<ref>Bradbury, p.81.</ref> Stephen started by attacking [[Wallingford Castle]], held by the Empress's childhood friend [[Brien FitzCount]], only to find it too well defended.<ref>Bradbury, p.83.</ref> Stephen left behind some forces to blockade the castle and continued west into Wiltshire to attack [[Trowbridge#Castle|Trowbridge]], taking the castles of [[List of castles in Gloucestershire|South Cerney]] and [[Malmesbury]] en route.<ref>Bradbury, pp.82<U+2013>83.</ref> Meanwhile, Miles of Gloucester marched east, attacking Stephen's rearguard forces at Wallingford and threatening an advance on London.<ref>Davis, p.42.</ref> Stephen was forced to give up his western campaign, returning east to stabilise the situation and protect his capital.<ref name=DavisP43>Davis, p.43.</ref>

At the start of 1140, [[Nigel (Bishop of Ely)|Nigel]], the Bishop of Ely, whose castles Stephen had confiscated the previous year, rebelled against Stephen as well.<ref name=DavisP43/> Nigel hoped to seize [[East Anglia]] and established his base of operations in the [[Isle of Ely]], then surrounded by protective [[fenland]].<ref name=DavisP43/> Stephen responded quickly, taking an army into the fens and using boats lashed together to form a causeway that allowed him to make a surprise attack on the isle.<ref name=BradburyP88>Bradbury, p.88.</ref> Nigel escaped to Gloucester, but his men and castle were captured, and order was temporarily restored in the east.<ref name=BradburyP88/> Robert of Gloucester's men retook some of the territory that Stephen had taken in his 1139 campaign.<ref>Bradbury, p.90.</ref> In an effort to negotiate a truce, Henry of Blois held a peace conference at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], to which Stephen sent his wife. The conference collapsed over the insistence by Henry and the clergy that they should set the terms of any peace deal, which Stephen found unacceptable.<ref>Bradbury, p.91.</ref>

[[Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester|Ranulf of Chester]] remained upset over Stephen's gift of the north of England to Prince Henry.<ref name=DavisP50>Davis, p.50.</ref> Ranulf devised a plan for dealing with the problem by ambushing Henry whilst the prince was travelling back from Stephen's court to Scotland after Christmas.<ref name=DavisP50/> Stephen responded to rumours of this plan by escorting Henry himself north, but this gesture proved the final straw for Ranulf.<ref name=DavisP50/> Ranulf had previously claimed that he had the rights to [[Lincoln Castle]], held by Stephen, and under the guise of a social visit, Ranulf seized the fortification in a surprise attack.<ref>Davis, pp.50<U+2013>51.</ref> Stephen marched north to Lincoln and agreed to a truce with Ranulf, probably to keep him from joining the Empress's faction, under which Ranulf would be allowed to keep the castle.<ref name=DavisP51>Davis, p.51.</ref> Stephen returned to London but received news that Ranulf, his brother and their family were relaxing in Lincoln Castle with a minimal guard force, a ripe target for a surprise attack of his own.<ref name=DavisP51/> Abandoning the deal he had just made, Stephen gathered his army again and sped north, but not quite fast enough<U+2014>Ranulf escaped Lincoln and declared his support for the Empress, and Stephen was forced to place the castle under siege.<ref name=DavisP51/>

Once news of Stephen's capture reached him, Geoffrey of Anjou invaded Normandy again and, in the absence of Waleran of Beaumont, who was still fighting in England, Geoffrey took all the duchy south of the [[river Seine]] and east of the [[Risle|river Risle]].<ref>Carpenter, p.173; Davis, p.68; Crouch (2008b), p.47.</ref> No help was forthcoming from Stephen's brother Theobald this time either, who appears to have been preoccupied with his own problems with France<U+2014>the new French king, [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], had rejected his father's regional alliance, improving relations with Anjou and taking a more bellicose line with Theobald, which would result in war the following year.<ref>Crouch (2008b), p.52.</ref> Geoffrey's success in Normandy and Stephen's weakness in England began to influence the loyalty of many Anglo-Norman barons, who feared losing their lands in England to Robert and the Empress, and their possessions in Normandy to Geoffrey.<ref>Davis, p.67.</ref> Many started to leave Stephen's faction. His friend and advisor Waleron was one of those who decided to defect in mid-1141, crossing into Normandy to secure his ancestral possessions by allying himself with the Angevins, and bringing Worcestershire into the Empress's camp.<ref>Davis, pp.67<U+2013>68.</ref> Waleron's twin brother, Robert of Leicester, effectively withdrew from fighting in the conflict at the same time. Other supporters of the Empress were restored in their former strongholds, such as Bishop Nigel of Ely, and others still received new earldoms in the west of England. The royal control over the [[Mint (coin)|minting]] of coins broke down, leading to coins being struck by local barons and bishops across the country.<ref>Blackburn, p.199.</ref>

[[Image:Oxford Castle.JPG|thumb|left|180px|alt=A photograph of Oxford Castle in the 21st century|St George's Tower at [[Oxford Castle]], where Stephen almost captured the Empress Matilda]]
Stephen's wife Matilda played a critical part in keeping the king's cause alive during his captivity. Queen Matilda gathered Stephen's remaining lieutenants around her and the royal family in the south-east, advancing into London when the population rejected the Empress.<ref name="Crouch 2002, p.261">Crouch (2002), p.261.</ref> Stephen's long-standing commander William of Ypres remained with the queen in London; William Martel, the royal steward, commanded operations from [[Sherborne]] in Dorset, and Faramus of Boulogne ran the royal household.<ref>Bennett, p.106; Crouch (2002), p.261.</ref> The queen appears to have generated genuine sympathy and support from Stephen's more loyal followers.<ref name="Crouch 2002, p.261"/> Henry's alliance with the Empress proved short-lived, as they soon fell out over political patronage and ecclesiastical policy; the bishop met Stephen's wife Queen Matilda at [[Guildford]] and transferred his support to her.<ref name=BarlowP176>Barlow, p.176.</ref>

The king's eventual release resulted from the Angevin defeat at the [[rout of Winchester]]. Robert of Gloucester and the Empress besieged Henry in the city of Winchester in July.<ref>Bradbury, p.121.</ref> Queen Matilda and William of Ypres then encircled the Angevin forces with their own army, reinforced with fresh troops from London.<ref name=BarlowP176/> In the subsequent battle the Empress's forces were defeated and Robert of Gloucester himself was taken prisoner.<ref name=BarlowP177>Barlow, p.177.</ref> Further negotiations attempted to deliver a general peace agreement but Queen Matilda was unwilling to offer any compromise to the Empress, and Robert refused to accept any offer to encourage him to change sides to Stephen.<ref name=BarlowP177/> Instead, in November the two sides simply exchanged Robert and the king, and Stephen began re-establishing his authority.<ref name=BarlowP177/> Henry held another church council, which this time reaffirmed Stephen's legitimacy to rule, and a fresh coronation of Stephen and Matilda occurred at Christmas 1141.<ref name=BarlowP177/>

At the beginning of 1142 Stephen fell ill, and by Easter rumours had begun to circulate that he had died.<ref>Bradbury, pp.134, 136.</ref> Possibly this illness was the result of his imprisonment the previous year, but he finally recovered and travelled north to raise new forces and to successfully convince [[Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester|Ranulf of Chester]] to change sides once again.<ref name="Barlow, p.178">Barlow, p.178.</ref> Stephen then spent the summer attacking some of the new Angevin castles built the previous year, including [[Cirencester Castle|Cirencester]], [[Bampton Castle, Oxfordshire|Bampton]] and [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]].<ref name=BradburyP136>Bradbury, p.136.</ref> In September, he spotted an opportunity to seize the Empress Matilda herself in [[Oxford]].<ref name=BradburyP136/> Oxford was a secure town, protected by walls and the [[river Isis]], but Stephen led a sudden attack across the river, leading the charge and swimming part of the way.<ref name=BradburyP137>Bradbury, p.137.</ref> Once on the other side, the king and his men stormed into the town, trapping the Empress in the castle.<ref name=BradburyP137/> [[Oxford Castle]], however, was a powerful fortress and, rather than storming it, Stephen had to settle down for a long siege, albeit secure in the knowledge that Matilda was now surrounded.<ref name=BradburyP137/> Just before Christmas, the Empress sneaked out of the castle, crossed the icy river on foot and made her escape to Wallingford. The garrison surrendered shortly afterwards, but Stephen had lost an opportunity to capture his principal opponent.<ref>Bradbury, pp.137<U+2013>138.</ref>

===Stalemate (1143<U+2013>46)===
[[File:Invasion of Normandy 1142-3.png|thumb|alt=A map of Normandy in 1142|[[Geoffrey of Anjou]]'s invasion of Normandy, 1142<U+2013>43]]
The war between the two sides in England reached a stalemate in the mid-1140s, while Geoffrey of Anjou consolidated his hold on power in Normandy.<ref>Davis, p.78.</ref> 1143 started precariously for Stephen when he was besieged by Robert of Gloucester at [[Wilton Castle]], an assembly point for royal forces in [[Herefordshire]].<ref name=BradburyP139>Bradbury, p.139.</ref> Stephen attempted to break out and escape, resulting in the [[Battle of Wilton (1143)|battle of Wilton]]. Once again, the Angevin cavalry proved too strong, and for a moment it appeared that Stephen might be captured for a second time.<ref>Bradbury, p.140.</ref> On this occasion, however, [[William Martel]], Stephen's steward, made a fierce rear guard effort, allowing Stephen to escape from the battlefield.<ref name=BradburyP139/> Stephen valued William's loyalty sufficiently to agree to exchange [[Sherborne Castle]] for his safe release<U+2014>this was one of the few instances where Stephen was prepared to give up a castle to ransom one his men.<ref>Bradbury, pp.140<U+2013>141.</ref>

In late 1143, Stephen faced a new threat in the east, when [[Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex|Geoffrey de Mandeville]], the [[Earl of Essex]], rose up in rebellion against the king in East Anglia.<ref>Bradbury, p.141.</ref> Stephen had disliked the baron for several years, and provoked the conflict by summoning Geoffrey to court, where the king arrested him.<ref name=BradburyP143/> Stephen threatened to execute Geoffrey unless the baron handed over his various castles, including the [[Tower of London]], [[Saffron Walden Castle|Saffron Walden]] and [[Pleshey Castle|Pleshey]], all important fortifications because they were in, or close to, London.<ref name=BradburyP143>Bradbury, p.143.</ref> Geoffrey gave in, but once free he headed north-east into the Fens to the [[Isle of Ely]], from where he began a military campaign against [[Cambridge]], with the intention of progressing south towards London.<ref>Bradbury, p.144.</ref> With all of his other problems and with [[Hugh Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk|Hugh Bigod]] still in open revolt in [[Norfolk]], Stephen lacked the resources to track Geoffrey down in the Fens and made do with building a screen of castles between Ely and London, including [[Burwell Castle]].<ref>Bradbury, p.145.</ref>

For a period, the situation continued to worsen. Ranulf of Chester revolted once again in the summer of 1144, splitting up Stephen's [[Honour of Lancaster]] between himself and Prince Henry.<ref name=BarlowP179>Barlow, p.179.</ref> In the west, Robert of Gloucester and his followers continued to raid the surrounding royalist territories, and Wallingford Castle remained a secure Angevin stronghold, too close to London for comfort.<ref name=BarlowP179/> Meanwhile, Geoffrey of Anjou finished securing his hold on southern Normandy and in January 1144 he advanced into [[Rouen]], the capital of the duchy, concluding his campaign.<ref name="Barlow, p.178"/> Louis VII recognised him as Duke of Normandy shortly after.<ref>Amt, p.7.</ref> By this point in the war, Stephen was depending increasingly on his immediate royal household, such as William of Ypres and others, and lacked the support of the major barons who might have been able to provide him with significant additional forces; after the events of 1141, Stephen made little use of his network of earls.<ref>Crouch (2002), p.269; White (1998), p.133.</ref>

After 1143 the war ground on, but progressing slightly better for Stephen.<ref>Bradbury, p.158.</ref> [[Miles of Gloucester]], one of the most talented Angevin commanders, had died whilst hunting over the previous Christmas, relieving some of the pressure in the west.<ref>Bradbury, p.147.</ref> Geoffrey de Mandeville's rebellion continued until September 1144, when he died during an attack on Burwell.<ref name=BradburyP146>Bradbury, p.146.</ref> The war in the west progressed better in 1145, with the king recapturing [[Faringdon Castle]] in [[Oxfordshire]].<ref name=BradburyP146/> In the north, Stephen came to a fresh agreement with Ranulf of Chester, but then in 1146 repeated the ruse he had played on Geoffrey de Mandeville in 1143, first inviting Ranulf to court, before arresting him and threatening to execute him unless he handed over a number of castles, including [[Lincoln Castle|Lincoln]] and [[Coventry Castle|Coventry]].<ref name=BarlowP179/> As with Geoffrey, the moment Ranulf was released he immediately rebelled, but the situation was a stalemate: Stephen had few forces in the north with which to prosecute a fresh campaign, whilst Ranulf lacked the castles to support an attack on Stephen.<ref name=BarlowP179/> By this point, however, Stephen's practice of inviting barons to court and arresting them had brought him into some disrepute and increasing distrust.<ref>Davis, p.97.</ref>

===Final phases of the war (1147<U+2013>52)===
[[Image:Jindra Eleonora.jpg|thumb|170px|alt=A medieval picture of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine|14th century depiction of [[Henry II of England|Henry Fitzempress]] and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]]]

England had suffered extensively from the war by 1147, leading to later Victorian historians terming the conflict the period of "[[the Anarchy]]".{{#tag:ref|As described below, the term "the Anarchy" as a label for this conflict originates with the Victorian scholar [[John Horace Round|John Round]].<ref>Round (1888), cited ''[http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1038 Review of King Stephen, (review no. 1038)]'', David Crouch, ''Reviews in History'', accessed 12 May 2011.</ref>|group="nb"}} The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' recorded how "there was nothing but disturbance and wickedness and robbery".<ref>Huscroft, p.76.</ref> Certainly in many parts of the country, such as [[Wiltshire]], [[Berkshire]], the [[Thames Valley]] and [[East Anglia]], the fighting and raiding had caused serious devastation.<ref name=BarlowP181>Barlow, p.181.</ref> Numerous "[[Castles in Great Britain and Ireland#The Anarchy|adulterine]]", or unauthorised, castles had been built as bases for local lords<U+2014>the chronicler [[Robert of Torigny]] complained that as many as 1,115 such castles had been built during the conflict, although this was probably an exaggeration as elsewhere he suggested an alternative figure of 126.<ref>Coulson, p.69; Bradbury, p.191.</ref> The previously centralised royal coinage system was fragmented, with Stephen, the Empress and local lords all minting their own coins.<ref name=BarlowP181/> The royal [[forest law]] had collapsed in large parts of the country.<ref>Carpenter, p.197.</ref> Some parts of the country, though, were barely touched by the conflict<U+2014>for example, Stephen's lands in the south-east and the Angevin heartlands around Gloucester and Bristol were largely unaffected, and David I ruled his territories in the north of England effectively.<ref name=BarlowP181/> The king's overall income from his estates, however, declined seriously during the conflict, particularly after 1141, and royal control over the [[Mint (coin)|mint]]ing of new coins remained limited outside of the south-east and East Anglia.<ref>White (1998), p.43; Blackburn, p.199.</ref> With Stephen often based in the south-east, increasingly [[Westminster]], rather than the older site of [[Winchester]], was used as the centre of royal government.<ref>Green, pp.110<U+2013>111, cited White, p.132.</ref>

The character of the conflict in England gradually began to shift; as historian Frank Barlow suggests, by the late 1140s "the civil war was over", barring the occasional outbreak of fighting.<ref name=BarlowP180>Barlow, p.180.</ref> In 1147 Robert of Gloucester died peacefully, and the next year the Empress Matilda left south-west England for Normandy, both of which contributed to reducing the tempo of the war.<ref name=BarlowP180/> The [[Second Crusade]] was announced, and many Angevin supporters, including Waleran of Beaumont, joined it, leaving the region for several years.<ref name=BarlowP180/> Many of the barons were making individual peace agreements with each other to secure their lands and war gains.<ref>Davis, pp.111<U+2013>112.</ref> Geoffrey and Matilda's son, the future King Henry II, mounted a small mercenary invasion of England in 1147 but the expedition failed, not least because Henry lacked the funds to pay his men.<ref name=BarlowP180/> Surprisingly, Stephen himself ended up paying their costs, allowing Henry to return home safely; his reasons for doing so are unclear. One potential explanation is his general courtesy to a member of his extended family; another is that he was starting to consider how to end the war peacefully, and saw this as a way of building a relationship with Henry.<ref>King (2010), p.243; Barlow, p.180.</ref>

The young Henry FitzEmpress returned to England again in 1149, this time planning to form a northern alliance with Ranulf of Chester.<ref>King (2010), p.253.</ref> The Angevin plan involved Ranulf agreeing to give up his claim to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], held by the Scots, in return for being given the rights to the whole of the Honour of Lancaster; Ranulf would give homage to both David and Henry Fitzempress, with Henry having seniority.<ref>King (2010), p.254.</ref> Following this peace agreement, Henry and Ranulf agreed to attack [[York]], probably with help from the Scots.<ref>King (2010), p.255.</ref> Stephen marched rapidly north to York and the planned attack disintegrated, leaving Henry to return to Normandy, where he was declared Duke by his father.<ref name=DavidKingP255>Davis, p.107; King (2010), p.255.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Edmund King believes the attack never got close to York; R. Davis believes that it did and was deterred by the presence of Stephen's forces.<ref name=DavidKingP255/>|group="nb"}}

Although still young, Henry was increasingly gaining a reputation as an energetic and capable leader. His prestige and power increased further when he unexpectedly married [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] in 1152; Eleanor was the attractive [[Duke of Aquitaine|Duchess of Aquitaine]] and the recently divorced wife of [[Louis VII of France]], and the marriage made Henry the future ruler of a huge swathe of territory across France.<ref>Carpenter, p.188.</ref>

In the final years of the war, Stephen began to focus on the issue of his family and the succession.<ref>King (2010), p.237.</ref> Stephen's eldest son was [[Eustace IV, Count of Boulogne|Eustace]] and the king wanted to confirm him as his successor, although chroniclers recorded that Eustace was infamous for levying heavy taxes and extorting money from those on his lands.<ref>King (2010), pp.237<U+2013>238.</ref> Stephen's second son, [[William I, Count of Boulogne|William]], was married to the extremely wealthy heiress [[Isabel de Warenne, 4th Countess of Surrey|Isabel de Warenne]].<ref>King (2010), pp.238<U+2013>239.</ref> In 1148, Stephen built the [[Cluny Abbey|Cluniac]] [[Faversham Abbey]] as a resting place for his family. Both Stephen's wife, Queen Matilda, and his older brother Theobald died in 1152.<ref>Bradbury, p.206; Crouch (2002), p.275.</ref>

===Argument with the church (1145<U+2013>52)===
[[File:Bernard of Clairvaux 13th century.jpg|thumb|alt=A medieval picture of Bernard of Clairvaux and two nuns|A 13th century depiction of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], with whom Stephen argued over ecclesiastical policy]]
Stephen's relationship with the church deteriorated badly towards the end of his reign.<ref name=DavisP98>Davis, p.98.</ref> The reforming movement within the church, which advocated greater autonomy from royal authority for the clergy, had continued to grow, while new voices such as the Cistercians had gained additional prestige within the monastic orders, eclipsing older orders such as the Cluniacs.<ref name=DavisP98/> Stephen's dispute with the church had its origins in 1140, when Archbishop [[Thurstan]] of York died. An argument then broke out between a group of reformers based in York and backed by [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], the head of the Cistercian order, who preferred William of Rievaulx as the new archbishop, and Stephen and his brother Henry of Blois, who preferred various Blois family relatives.<ref>Davis, pp.99<U+2013>100.</ref> The row between Henry and Bernard grew increasingly personal, and Henry used his authority as legate to appoint his nephew [[William of York]] to the post in 1144 only to find that, when Pope [[Innocent II]] died in 1145, Bernard was able to get the appointment rejected by Rome.<ref>Davis, p.100.</ref> Bernard then convinced Pope [[Eugene III]] to overturn Henry's decision altogether in 1147, deposing William, and appointing [[Henry Murdac]] as archbishop instead.<ref>Davis, p.101.</ref>

Stephen was furious over what he saw as potentially precedent-setting papal interference in his royal authority, and initially refused to allow Murdac into England.<ref name=DavisPP101>Davis, pp.101, 104.</ref> When Theobald, the Archbishop of Canterbury, went to consult with the Pope on the matter against Stephen's wishes, the king refused to allow him back into England either, and seized his estates.<ref name=DavisPP101/> Stephen also cut his links to the Cistercian order, and turned instead to the Cluniacs, of which Henry was a member.<ref>Davis, p.103.</ref>

Nonetheless, the pressure on Stephen to get Eustace confirmed as his legitimate heir continued to grow. The king gave Eustace the County of Boulogne in 1147, but it remained unclear whether Eustace would inherit England.<ref name=DavisP105>Davis, p.105.</ref> Stephen's preferred option was to have Eustace crowned while he himself was still alive, as was the custom in France, but this was not the normal practice in England, and [[Pope Celestine II|Celestine II]], during his brief tenure as pope between 1143 and 1144, had banned any change to this practice.<ref name=DavisP105/> Since the only person who could crown Eustace was Archbishop Theobald, who refused to do so without agreement from the current pope, Eugene III, the matter reached an impasse.<ref name=DavisP105/>{{#tag:ref|Historian Keith Stringer argues that Theobald was also probably thinking about an eventual peace treaty in England involving Henry Fitzempress, and that he may have seen the coronation of Eustace only as a guarantee of further civil war after Stephen's death.<ref>Stringer, p.68.</ref> |group="nb"}} At the end of 1148, Stephen and Theobald came to a temporary compromise that allowed Theobald to return to England. Theobald was appointed a papal legate in 1151, adding to his authority.<ref>King (2010), pp.263<U+2013>264.</ref> Stephen then made a fresh attempt to have Eustace crowned at Easter 1152, gathering his nobles to swear fealty to Eustace, and then insisting that Theobald and his bishops anoint him king.<ref name=King2010P264>King (2010), p.264.</ref> When Theobald refused yet again, Stephen and Eustace imprisoned both him and the bishops and refused to release them unless they agreed to crown Eustace.<ref name=King2010P264/> Theobald escaped again into temporary exile in [[Flanders]], pursued to the coast by Stephen's knights, marking a low point in Stephen's relationship with the church.<ref name=King2010P264/>

===Treaties and peace (1153<U+2013>54)===
[[IMage:Political map of England 1153.PNG|thumb|alt=A colour coded map showing the political factions in 1153|A political map of England in 1153; red indicates those areas broadly under Stephen's control; blue <U+2013> Angevin; grey <U+2013> indigenous Welsh; cream <U+2013> Ranulf of Chester and Robert of Leicester; green <U+2013> David I of Scotland]]
Henry FitzEmpress returned to England again at the start of 1153  with a small army, supported in the north and east of England by Ranulf of Chester and Hugh Bigod.<ref>Bradbury, pp.178<U+2013>179.</ref> Stephen's castle at [[Malmesbury Castle|Malmesbury]] was besieged by Henry's forces and the king responded by marching west with an army to relieve it.<ref name=BradburyP180>Bradbury, p.180.</ref> Stephen unsuccessfully attempted to force Henry's smaller army to fight a decisive battle along the [[River Avon (Bristol)|river Avon]].<ref name=BradburyP180/> In the face of the increasingly wintry weather, Stephen agreed to a temporary truce and returned to London, leaving Henry to travel north through [[Midlands (England)|the Midlands]] where the powerful [[Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester|Robert de Beaumont]], Earl of Leicester, announced his support for the Angevin cause.<ref name=BradburyP180/> Despite only modest military successes, Henry and his allies now controlled the south-west, the Midlands and much of the north of England.<ref>Bradbury, p.181.</ref>

Over the summer, Stephen intensified the long-running siege of [[Wallingford Castle]] in a final attempt to take this major Angevin stronghold.<ref>Bradbury, p.182.</ref> The fall of Wallingford appeared imminent and Henry marched south in an attempt to relieve the siege, arriving with a small army and placing Stephen's besieging forces under siege themselves.<ref name=BradburyP183>Bradbury, p.183.</ref> Upon news of this, Stephen gathered up a large force and marched from Oxford, and the two sides confronted each other across the [[River Thames]] at Wallingford in July.<ref name=BradburyP183/> By this point in the war, the barons on both sides seem to have been eager to avoid an open battle.<ref name=BradburyKingCrouchP276>Bradbury, p.183; King (2010), p.277; Crouch (2002), p.276.</ref> As a result, instead of a battle ensuing, members of the church [[Treaty of Wallingford|brokered a truce]], to the annoyance of both Stephen and Henry.<ref name=BradburyKingCrouchP276/>

In the aftermath of Wallingford, Stephen and Henry spoke together privately about a potential end to the war; Stephen's son Eustace, however, was furious about the peaceful outcome at Wallingford. He left his father and returned home to Cambridge to gather more funds for a fresh campaign, where he fell ill and died the next month.<ref>King (2010), pp.278<U+2013>279; Crouch (2002), p.276.</ref> Eustace's death removed an obvious claimant to the throne and was politically convenient for those seeking a permanent peace in England. It is possible, however, that Stephen had already begun to consider passing over Eustace's claim; historian Edmund King observes that Eustace's claim to the throne was not mentioned in the discussions at Wallingford, for example, and this may have added to Stephen's son's anger.<ref>King (2010), p.278.</ref>

Fighting continued after Wallingford, but in a rather half-hearted fashion. Stephen lost the towns of [[Oxford]] and [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]] to Henry while the king was diverted fighting Hugh Bigod in the east of England, but [[Nottingham Castle]] survived an Angevin attempt to capture it.<ref>Bradbury, p.184.</ref> Meanwhile, Stephen's brother Henry of Blois and Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury were for once unified in an effort to broker a permanent peace between the two sides, putting pressure on Stephen to accept a deal.<ref>King (2010), pp.279<U+2013>280; Bradbury, p.187.</ref> Stephen and Henry FitzEmpress's armies met again at Winchester, where the two leaders would ratify the terms of a permanent peace in November.<ref>King (2010), p.280.</ref> Stephen announced the [[Treaty of Winchester]] in Winchester Cathedral: he recognised Henry FitzEmpress as his adopted son and successor, in return for Henry doing [[homage]] to him; Stephen promised to listen to Henry's advice, but retained all his royal powers; Stephen's remaining son, [[William I, Count of Boulogne|William]], would do homage to Henry and renounce his claim to the throne, in exchange for promises of the security of his lands; key royal castles would be held on Henry's behalf by guarantors whilst Stephen would have access to Henry's castles; and the numerous foreign mercenaries would be demobilised and sent home.<ref>King (2010), pp.280<U+2013>283; Bradbury pp.189<U+2013>190; Barlow, pp.187<U+2013>188.</ref> Stephen and Henry sealed the treaty with a [[kiss of peace]] in the cathedral.<ref>King (2010), p.281.</ref>

Stephen's decision to recognise Henry as his heir was, at the time, not necessarily a final solution to the civil war.<ref name=BradburyHoltP306>Bradbury, p.211; Holt, p.306.</ref> Despite the issuing of new currency and administrative reforms, Stephen might potentially have lived for many more years, whilst Henry's position on the continent was far from secure.<ref name=BradburyHoltP306/> Although Stephen's son William was young and unprepared to challenge Henry for the throne in 1153, the situation could well have shifted in subsequent years<U+2014>there were widespread rumours during 1154 that William planned to assassinate Henry, for example.<ref name="Crouch 2002, p.277">Crouch (2002), p.277.</ref> Historian Graham White describes the treaty of Winchester as a "precarious peace", capturing the judgement of most modern historians that the situation in late 1153 was still uncertain and unpredictable.<ref>White (1990), p.12, cited Bradbury, p.211.</ref>

Certainly many problems remained to be resolved, including re-establishing royal authority over the provinces and resolving the complex issue of which barons should control the contested lands and estates after the long civil war.<ref>Davis, pp.122<U+2013>123.</ref> Stephen burst into activity in early 1154, travelling around the kingdom extensively.<ref>Amt, p.19.</ref> He began issuing royal [[writ]]s for the south-west of England once again and travelled to [[York]] where he held a major court in an attempt to impress upon the northern barons that royal authority was being reasserted.<ref name="Crouch 2002, p.277"/> After a busy summer in 1154, however, Stephen travelled to [[Dover]] to meet the [[Thierry, Count of Flanders|Count of Flanders]]; some historians believe that the king was already ill and preparing to settle his family affairs.<ref name=King2010P300>King (2010), p.300.</ref> Stephen fell ill with a [[Stomach disease|stomach disorder]] and died on 25 October at the [[Dover Priory|local priory]], being buried at Faversham Abbey with his wife Matilda and son Eustace.<ref name=King2010P300/>

==Legacy==
===Aftermath===
After Stephen's death, Henry II succeeded to the throne of England. Henry vigorously re-established royal authority in the aftermath of the civil war, dismantling castles and increasing revenues, although several of these trends had begun under Stephen.<ref name=WhiteAmtP44>White (1998), p.137; Amt, p.44.</ref> The destruction of castles under Henry was not as dramatic as once thought, and although he restored royal revenues, the economy of England remained broadly unchanged under both rulers.<ref name=WhiteAmtP44/> Stephen's remaining son [[William I, Count of Boulogne|William I of Blois]] was confirmed as the [[Earl of Surrey]] by Henry, and prospered under the new regime, with the occasional point of tension with Henry.<ref>Crouch (2002), p.281.</ref> Stephen's daughter [[Marie I, Countess of Boulogne|Marie I of Boulogne]] also survived her father; she had been placed in a convent by Stephen, but after his death left and married.<ref name="Crouch 2002, p.277"/> Stephen's middle son, Baldwin, and second daughter, Matilda, had died before 1147 and were buried at [[Holy Trinity Priory, Aldgate]].<ref>King (2010), pp.xvi, 313.</ref> Stephen probably had three illegitimate sons, [[Gervase de Blois|Gervase]], Ralph and Americ, by his mistress Damette; Gervase became [[Abbot of Westminster]] in 1138, but after his father's death was removed by Henry in 1157 and died shortly afterwards.<ref>Mason, pp.37, 58; King (2010), p.98.</ref>

===Historiography===
[[Image:Peterborough.Chronicle.firstpagetrimmed.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph of the first page of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|The first page of the Peterborough element of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', written around 1150, which details the events of Stephen's reign]]
Much of the modern history of Stephen's reign is based on accounts of [[chronicler]]s who lived in, or close to, the middle of the 12th century, forming a relatively rich account of the period.<ref>King (2006), p.195.</ref> All of the main chronicler accounts carry significant regional biases in how they portray the disparate events. Several of the key chronicles were written in the south-west of England, including the ''[[Gesta Stephani]]'', or "Acts of Stephen", and [[William of Malmesbury]]'s ''Historia Novella'', or "New History".<ref name=DavisP146>Davis, p.146.</ref> In Normandy, [[Orderic Vitalis]] wrote his ''Ecclesiastical History'', covering Stephen's reign until 1141, and [[Robert of Torigni]] wrote a later history of the rest of the period.<ref name=DavisP146/> [[Henry of Huntingdon]], who lived in the east of England, produced the ''Historia Anglorum'' that provides a regional account of the reign.<ref>Davis, pp.147, 150.</ref> The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' was past its prime by the time of Stephen, but is remembered for its striking account of conditions during "the Anarchy".<ref>Davis, p.151.</ref> Most of the chronicles carry some bias for or against Stephen, Robert of Gloucester or other key figures in the conflict.<ref>Davis, pp.146<U+2013>152.</ref> Those writing for the church after the events of Stephen's later reign, such as [[John of Salisbury]] for example, paint the king as a tyrant due to his argument with the Archbishop of Canterbury; by contrast, clerics in Durham regarded Stephen as a saviour, due to his contribution to the defeat of the Scots at the [[battle of the Standard]].<ref>Barlow, p.188.</ref> Later chronicles written during the reign of Henry II were generally more negative: [[Walter Map]], for example, described Stephen as "a fine knight, but in other respects almost a fool."<ref>Stringer, p.3.</ref> A number of [[charter]]s were issued during Stephen's reign, often giving details of current events or daily routine, and these have become widely used as sources by modern historians.<ref>Chibnall (2008), p.1.</ref>

Historians in the "[[Whig history|Whiggish]]" tradition that emerged during the Victorian period traced a progressive and [[Universalism|universalist]] course of political and economic development in England over the medieval period.<ref name=DyerP4CossP81>Dyer, p.4; Coss, p.81.</ref> [[William Stubbs]] focused on these constitutional aspects of Stephen's reign in his 1874 volume the ''Constitutional History of England'', beginning an enduring interest in Stephen and his reign.<ref name=CrouchReviewOf>''[http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1038 Review of King Stephen, (review no. 1038)]'', David Crouch, ''Reviews in History'', accessed 12 May 2011; Stubbs (1874), cited ''[http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1038 Review of King Stephen, (review no. 1038)]'', David Crouch, ''Reviews in History'', accessed 12 May 2011.</ref> Stubbs' analysis, focusing on the disorder of the period, influenced his student [[John Horace Round|John Round]] to coin the term "the Anarchy" to describe the period, a label that, whilst sometimes critiqued, continues to be used today.<ref>''[http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1038 Review of King Stephen, (review no. 1038)]'', David Crouch, ''Reviews in History'', accessed 12 May 2011; Kadish, p.40; Round (1888), cited ''[http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1038 Review of King Stephen, (review no. 1038)]'', David Crouch, ''Reviews in History'', accessed 12 May 2011.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Jim Bradbury provides an accessible summary of the argument as to the extent of "the Anarchy".<ref>Bradbury, p.219.</ref>|group="nb"}} The late-Victorian scholar [[Frederic William Maitland]] also introduced the possibility that Stephen's reign marked a turning point in English legal history<U+2014>the so-called "tenurial crisis".<ref name=CrouchReviewOf/>

Stephen remains a popular subject for historical study: David Crouch suggests that after [[John of England|King John]] he is "arguably the most written-about medieval king of England".<ref>''[http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1038 Review of King Stephen, (review no. 1038)]'', David Crouch, ''Reviews in History'', accessed 12 May 2011.</ref> Modern historians vary in their assessments of Stephen as a king. Historian [[Ralph Henry Carless Davis|R. H. Davis]]'s influential biography paints a picture of a weak king: a capable military leader in the field, full of activity and pleasant, but "beneath the surface&nbsp;... mistrustful and sly", with poor strategic judgement that ultimately undermined his reign.<ref>Davis, p.127.</ref> Stephen's lack of sound policy judgement and his mishandling of international affairs, leading to the loss of Normandy and his consequent inability to win the civil war in England, is also highlighted by another of his biographers, David Crouch.<ref>Crouch (2008b), p.58.</ref> Historian and biographer Edmund King, whilst painting a slightly more positive picture than Davis, also concludes that Stephen, while a stoic, pious and genial leader, was also rarely, if ever, his own man, usually relying upon stronger characters such as his brother or wife.<ref>King (2010), pp.338<U+2013>339.</ref> Historian Keith Stringer provides a more positive portrayal of Stephen, arguing that his ultimate failure as king was the result of external pressures on the Norman state, rather than the result of personal failings.<ref>Stringer, pp.86, 90.</ref>

===Popular representations===
{{Main|Cultural depictions of Stephen of England}}
Stephen and his reign have been occasionally used in historical fiction. Stephen and his supporters appear in [[Ellis Peters]]' historical detective series ''[[Brother Cadfael]]'', set between 1137 and 1145.<ref name=RiellyP62>Rielly, p.62.</ref> Peters' depiction of Stephen's reign is an essentially local narrative, focused on the town of [[Shrewsbury]] and its environs.<ref name=RiellyP62/> Peters paints Stephen as a tolerant man and a reasonable ruler, despite his execution of the Shrewsbury defenders after the taking of the city in 1138.<ref>Rielly, p.68.</ref> In contrast, Stephen is depicted in both [[Ken Follett]]'s historical novel ''[[The Pillars of the Earth]]'' and [[The Pillars of the Earth (TV miniseries)|TV mini-series]] as a conniving villain. Although Follett begins his book with [[Austin Lane Poole|Austin Poole]]'s account of the sinking of the White Ship to set the historical scene for the subsequent events, in many other ways Follett uses Stephen's reign as a location for a story about essentially modern personalities and issues, a feature reproduced in the epic costume TV adaptation.<ref>Turner, p.122; Ramet, p.108; ''[http://tv.nytimes.com/2010/07/23/arts/television/23pillars.html?_r=2 Blood on Their Hands, and Sex on Their Minds]'', Mike Hale, ''The New York Times'', published 22 July 2010, accessed 15 May 2011.</ref>

==Issue==

Stephen of Blois married [[Matilda of Boulogne]] in 1125. They had the following issue:

#[[Eustace IV, Count of Boulogne|Eustace]] (c. 1130 <U+2013> 1153), who succeeded his parents as Count Eustace IV of Boulogne
#Matilda (died before 1141), betrothed to [[Waleran de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Worcester]]
#[[Marie I, Countess of Boulogne|Marie]] (1136 <U+2013> 1182), who succeeded as Countess Marie I of Boulogne
#Baldwin (died before 1135)
#[[William I, Count of Boulogne|William]] (c. 1137 <U+2013> 1159), who succeeded as Count William I of Boulogne


King Stephen's illegitimate children by a certain Damette were:

#[[Gervase of Blois|Gervase]], Abbot of Westminster
#Ralph
#Americ
