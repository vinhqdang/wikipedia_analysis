'''Hippocrates of Cos II''' or '''Hippokrates of Kos''' (c. [[460 BC]] <U+2014> c. [[370 BC]], [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{polytonic|<U+1F39><U+03C0><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03BA><U+03C1><U+03AC><U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03C2>}}, 'Ippokr<U+00E1>t<U+0113>s) was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[physician]] of the [[Age of Pericles]], considered one of the most outstanding figures in the history of [[medicine]]. He is often referred to as "[[List of people known as the father or mother of something|The Father of Medicine]]" in recognition of his lasting contributions to the field as the founder of the Hippocratic school of medicine.  This intellectual school revolutionized [[medicine in ancient Greece]], establishing it as a discipline distinct from other fields that it had traditionally been associated with (notably [[theurgy]] and [[philosophy]]) and making a profession of it.<ref name=garrison9293> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=92<U+2013>93}} </ref><ref name=nuland5> {{Harvnb|Nuland|1988|p=5}} </ref>

The [[Hippocratic Corpus]], the collection of works produced by the Hippocratic school, is largely responsible for Hippocrates's renown. That body of work, however, is limited in its historical value because of its ambiguous authorship and a dearth of historical context. As such, the achievements of the writers of the Corpus, the practitioners of Hippocratic medicine and Hippocrates himself are often commingled; very little is known about what Hippocrates actually thought, wrote and did. Nevertheless, Hippocrates is commonly portrayed as the [[paragon]] of the ancient physician. In particular, he is credited with greatly advancing [[clinical medicine]], summing up the medical knowledge of previous schools, and prescribing practices for physicians through the [[Hippocratic Oath]] and other works.<ref name=garrison9293> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=92<U+2013>93}} </ref><ref> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=96}} </ref>

==Biography==
[[Image:Kos Asklepeion.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''[[Asklepieion]]'' on [[Kos]]]]
Historians accept that Hippocrates existed, was born around the year 460 BC on the [[Greece|Greek]] island of [[Kos]] (Cos), and became a famous physician and teacher of medicine. Other biographical information, however, is  apocryphal and likely to be untrue (''see [[Hippocrates#Legends|Legends]]'').<ref name=nuland4> {{Harvnb|Nuland|1988|p=4}} </ref>

[[Soranus (Greek Physician)|Soranus of Ephesus]], a Greek [[gynecologist]] of the 2nd century [[Anno Domini|AD]],<ref name=BCE>{{Harvnb|Britannica|2006}} </ref> was Hippocrates's first biographer and is the source of most information on Hippocrates's person. Information about Hippocrates can also be found in the writings of [[Aristotle]], which date from the 4th century BC, in the [[Suidas]] of the 10th century AD, and in the works of [[John Tzetzes]], which date from the 12th century AD.<ref name=garrison9293> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=92-93}} </ref><ref name=nuland7> {{Harvnb|Nuland|1988|p=7}} </ref> Soranus stated that Hippocrates's father was Heraclides, a physician; his mother was Praxitela, daughter of Phenaretis. The two sons of Hippocrates, Thessalus and Draco, and his son-in-law, Polybus, were his students. According to [[Galen]], a later physician, Polybus was Hippocrates<U+2019>s true successor, while Thessalus and Draco each had a son named Hippocrates.<ref name=adams19> {{Harvnb|Adams|1891|p=19}} </ref><ref name=mar66> {{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=66}} </ref> 

Soranus said that Hippocrates learned medicine from his father and grandfather, and studied other subjects with [[Democritus]] and [[Gorgias]]. Hippocrates was probably trained at the [[Healing temple|asklepieion]] of [[Kos]], and took lessons from the [[Thrace|Thracian]] physician [[Herodicus|Herodicus of Selymbria]]. The only contemporaneous mention of Hippocrates is in [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'', where Plato describes Hippocrates as "Hippocrates of Kos, the [[Asclepiad (Greek)|Asclepiad]]".<ref name=marti86> {{Harvnb|Mart<U+00ED>-Ib<U+00E1><U+00F1>ez|1961|p=86<U+2013>87}}</ref><ref name=plato> {{Harvnb|Plato|380 B.C.}} </ref> Hippocrates taught and practiced medicine throughout his life, traveling at least as far as [[Thessaly]], [[Thrace]], and the [[Sea of Marmara]].<ref name=mar66> {{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=66}} </ref> He probably died in [[Larissa]] at the age of 83 or 90, though some accounts say he lived to be well over 100; several different accounts of his death exist.<ref name=mar66> {{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=66}} </ref>

==Hippocratic theory==

}}
Hippocrates is credited with being the first physician to reject superstitions and beliefs that credited supernatural or divine forces with causing illness. He separated the discipline of medicine from philosophy and religion, believing and arguing that disease was not a punishment inflicted by the [[Greek gods|gods]] but rather the product to environmental factors, diet and living habits. Indeed, there is not a single mention of a mystical illness in the entirety of the Hippocratic Corpus. However, Hippocrates did work with many convictions that were based on what is now known to be incorrect [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]], such as [[Humorism]].<ref name=jones11> {{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=11}}</ref><ref name=nuland8> {{Harvnb|Nuland|1988|p=8<U+2013>9}} </ref><ref name=garrison9394> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=93<U+2013>94}} </ref>

Ancient Greek schools of medicine were split (into the Knidian and Koan) on how to deal with disease. The [[Knidos|Knidian]] school of medicine focused on diagnosis, but was dependent on many faulty assumptions about the human body: Greek medicine at the time of Hippocrates knew almost nothing of human anatomy and physiology because of the Greek [[taboo]] forbidding the dissection of animals. The Knidian school consequently failed to distinguish when one disease caused many possible series of symptoms. <ref name=adams15> {{Harvnb|Adams|1891|p=15}} </ref> The Hippocratic school or [[Kos|Koan]] school achieved greater success by applying general [[diagnosis|diagnoses]] and passive treatments. Its focus was on patient care and [[prognosis]], not diagnosis. It could effectively treat diseases and allowed for a great development in clinical practice.<ref name=margotta67> {{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=67}} </ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Leff|Leff|1956|p=51}} </ref>

Despite all of its success, Hippocratic medicine and its philosophy are far removed from that of modern medicine, today. Now, the physician focuses on specific diagnosis and specialized treatment, both of which were espoused by the Knidian school. This shift in medical thought since Hippocrates's day has caused serious criticism over the past two millenia, with the passivity of Hippocratic treatment being the subject of particularly strong denunciations;<!--It seems to me that something is missing here.  Hippocrates used methods that succeeded at his time, when medical knowledge was insufficiently advanced to allow for diagnoses or specialized treatments; at that time, attending to the general wellness of the patient was often the best way to allow their own immune system to fight off a disease. I'm almost certain I've seen this opinion in writing somewhere, and if it can be found it should be included.--> for example, the [[French people|French]] doctor M. S. Houdart called the Hippocratic treatment a "meditation upon death".<ref name=jones1213> {{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=12<U+2013>13}} </ref>

===Humorism and crisis===
{{mainarticle|Humorism}}
The Hippocratic school held that all illness was the result of an imbalance in the body of the [[four humours]], fluids which were naturally equal in proportion (''pepsis'').<ref name=garrison99> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=99}} </ref> When the four humours, [[blood]], [[black bile]], [[yellow bile]] and [[phlegm]], were not in balance (''dyscrasia'', meaning "bad mixture"), a person would become sick and remain that way until the balance was somehow restored. Hippocratic therapy was directed towards restoring this balance. For instance, utilizing [[citrus]] was thought to be beneficial when an overabundance of phlegm was suspected.<ref name=boylan> {{Harvnb|Boylan|2006}} </ref>

Another important concept in Hippocratic medicine was that of a ''crisis'', a point in the progression of disease at which either the illness would begin triumph and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite and natural processes would make the patient recover. After a crisis, a relapse might follow, and then another deciding crisis. According to this doctrine, crises occur on ''critical days'', which were supposed to be a fixed time after the contraction of a disease. If a crisis occurs on a day far from a ''critical day'', a relapse may be expected. Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him.<ref name=jones464859> {{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=46,48,59}} </ref>

==Hippocratic therapy==
[[Image:HippocraticBench.png|thumb|300 px|A drawing of a [[Hippocratic bench]] from a [[Byzantine]] edition of [[Galen]]'s work in the 2nd century AD]]
Hippocratic medicine was humble and passive. The therapeutic approach was based on "the healing power of nature" ("''vis medicatrix naturae''" in [[Latin]]). According to this doctrine, the body contains within itself the power to re-balance the four humours and heal itself (''physis'').<ref name=garrison99> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=99}}</ref> Hippocratic therapy focused on simply easing this natural process. To this end, Hippocrates believed "rest and immobilization [were] of capital importance".<ref name=margotta73> {{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=73}}</ref> In general, the Hippocratic medicine was very kind to the patient; treatment was gentle, and emphasized keeping the patient clean and sterile. For example, only clean water or wine were ever used on wounds, though "dry" treatment was preferable. Soothing [[Balm|balms]] were sometimes employed.<ref name=garrison98> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=98}} </ref> 

Hippocrates was reluctant to administer drugs and engage in specialized treatment that might prove to be wrongly chosen; generalized therapy followed a generalized diagnosis.<ref name=garrison98> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=98}} </ref><ref name=sing35> {{Harvnb|Singer|Underwood|1962|p=35}} </ref> Potent drugs were, however, used on certain occasions.<ref name=britannica> {{Harvnb|Encyclopedia Britannica|1911}} </ref> This passive approach was very successful in treating relatively simple ailments such as broken bones which required [[Traction (orthopedics)|traction]] to stretch the skeletal system and relieve pressure on the injured area. The [[Hippocratic bench]] and other devices were used to this end.

One of the strengths of Hippocratic medicine was its emphasis on [[prognosis]]. At Hippocrates's time, medicinal therapy was quite immature, and often the best thing that physicians could do was to evaluate an illness and induce its likely progression based upon data collected in detailed case histories.<ref name=garrison9394 /><ref name=garrison97> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=97}} </ref>

==Professionalism==
[[Image:Ancientgreek surgical.jpg|thumb|250px|A number of ancient Greek surgical tools. On the left is a [[trephine]]; on the right, a set of [[scalpel]]s. Hippocratic medicine made good use of these tools.<ref name=adams17> {{Harvnb|Adams|1891|p=17}} </ref>]]
Hippocratic medicine was notable for its strict professionalism, discipline and rigorous practice.<ref name=garrison> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966}}</ref> The Hippocratic work "''On the Physician''" recommends that physicians always be well-kempt, honest, calm, understanding, and serious. The Hippocratic physician paid careful attention to all aspects of his practice: he followed detailed specifications for, "lighting, personnel, instruments, positioning of the patient, and techniques of bandaging and splinting" in the ancient [[operating room]].<ref name=margotta64> {{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=64}} </ref> He even kept his [[fingernail]]s to a precise length.<ref name=rutkow24> {{Harvnb|Rutkow|1993|p=24<U+2013>25}} </ref> 

The Hippocratic School gave importance to the clinical doctrines of observation and documentation. These doctrines dictate that physicians record their findings and their medicinal methods in a very clear and objective manner, so that these records may be passed down and employed by other physicians.<ref name=margotta66> {{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=66}} </ref> Hippocrates made careful, regular note of many symptoms including complexion, pulse, fever, pains, movement, and excretions.<ref name=garrison97 /> He is said to have measured a patient's pulse when taking a case history to know if the patient lied.<ref name=marti88> {{Harvnb|Mart<U+00ED>-Ib<U+00E1><U+00F1>ez|1961|p=88}} </ref> Hippocrates extended clinical observations into family history and environment.<ref name=margotta68> {{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=68}} </ref> "To him medicine owes the art of clinical inspection and observation".<ref name=garrison9394 /> For this reason, he may more properly be termed as the "Father of ''Clinical'' Medicine".<ref> {{Harvnb|Leff|Leff|1956|p=45}} </ref>

==Direct contributions to medicine==
[[Image:ClubbingFingers1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Clubbing of fingers secondary to [[pulmonary hypertension]] in a patient with [[Eisenmenger's syndrome]]. First described by Hippocrates, clubbing is also known as "Hippocratic fingers"]]
Hippocrates and his followers were first to describe many diseases and medical conditions. He is given credit for the first description of [[clubbing]] of the fingers, an important diagnostic sign in chronic supperative lung disease, [[lung cancer]] and [[Cyanotic heart defect|cyanotic heart disease]]. For this reason, clubbed fingers are sometimes referred to as "Hippocratic fingers".<ref name=schwartz> {{Harvnb|Schwartz|Richards|Goyal|2006}} </ref> Hippocrates was also the first physician to describe [[Hippocratic face]] in ''Prognosis''. [[Shakespeare]] famously alludes to this description when writing of [[Falstaff]]'s death in Act II, Scene iii. of ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''.<ref name=sing40> {{Harvnb|Singer|Underwood|1962|p=40}} </ref><ref name=margotta70> {{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=70}} </ref> 

Hippocrates began to categorize illnesses as [[Acute (medical)|acute]], [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]], [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] and [[epidemic]] use terms such as, "exacerbation, [[relapse]], resolution, crisis, [[paroxysm]], peak, and [[convalescence]]."<ref name=garrison97> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=97}}</ref><ref name=mart90> {{Harvnb|Mart<U+00ED>-Ib<U+00E1><U+00F1>ez|1961|p=90}} </ref> Another of Hippocrates's major contributions may be found in his descriptions of the symptomatology, physical findings, surgical treatment and prognosis of [[Empyema|thoracic empyema]], i.e. [[suppuration]] of the lining of the chest cavity. His teachings remain relevant to present-day students of [[Pulmonology|pulmonary medicine]] and surgery.<ref name=major> {{Harvnb|Major|1965}} </ref> Hippocrates was the first documented [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|chest surgeon]] and his findings are still valid.<ref name=major> {{Harvnb|Major|1965}} </ref>

==Hippocratic Corpus==
{{main|Hippocratic Corpus}}
The Hippocratic Corpus (Latin: ''Corpus Hippocratum'') is a collection of around seventy early medical works from ancient Greece, written in [[Ionic dialect|Ionic Greek]]. The question of whether Hippocrates himself was the author of the corpus has not been conclusively answered,<ref name=singer27> {{Harvnb|Singer|Underwood|1962|p=27}} </ref> but the volumes were probably produced by his students and followers.<ref name=hanson> {{Harvnb|Hanson|2006}} </ref> Because of the variety of subjects, writing styles and apparent date of construction, scholars believe Hippocratic Corpus could not have been written by one person (Ermerins numbers the authors at nineteen). The corpus was attributed to Hippocrates in antiquity, and its teaching generally followed principles of his; thus it came to be known by his name. It might be the remains of a library of Kos, or a collection compiled in the [[3rd century BC]] in [[Alexandria]].<ref name=margotta64 /><ref name=marti86> {{Harvnb|Mart<U+00ED>-Ib<U+00E1><U+00F1>ez|1961|p=86-87}}</ref> 

The Hippocratic Corpus contains textbooks, lectures, research, notes and philosophical essays on various subjects in medicine, in no particular order.<ref name=singer27/><ref name=rutkow23> {{Harvnb|Rutkow|p=23}} </ref> These works were written for different audiences, both specialists and laymen, and were sometimes written from opposing view points; significant contradictions can be found between works in the Corpus.<ref name=sing28> {{Harvnb|Singer|Underwood|1962|p=28}} </ref> Notable among the [[List of works in the Hippocratic Corpus|treatises of the Corpus]] are ''[[Hippocratic Oath|The Oath]]'', ''The Book of Prognostics'', ''On Regimen in Acute Diseases'', ''Aphorisms'', ''On Airs, Waters and Places'', ''Instruments of Reduction'', ''On The Sacred Disease'', etc.<ref name=britannica> {{Harvnb|Encyclopedia Britannica|1911}} </ref>

===Hippocratic Oath===
{{mainarticle|Hippocratic Oath}}
The [[Hippocratic Oath]], a seminal document on the [[ethics]] of medical practice, was attributed to Hippocrates in antiquity. This is probably the most famous document of the Hippocratic Corpus. Recently the authenticity of the document has come under scrutiny. While the Oath is rarely used in its original form today, it serves as a foundation for other, similar [[oath]]s and laws that define good medical practice and morals. Such derivatives are regularly taken today by medical graduates about to enter medical practice.<ref name=jones217> {{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=217}} </ref><ref name=marti86> {{Harvnb|Mart<U+00ED>-Ib<U+00E1><U+00F1>ez|1961|p=86-87}}</ref>

Retreived January 8, 2006</ref>-->]]
Hippocrates is widely considered as the "Father of Medicine".<ref name=hanson/> His contributions revolutionized the practice of medicine, but after his death the advancement stalled.<ref name=garrison100>{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=100}}</ref >So revered was Hippocrates that his teachings were largely taken as too great to be improved upon and no significant advancements of his methods were made for a long time.<ref name=marti86> {{Harvnb|Mart<U+00ED>-Ib<U+00E1><U+00F1>ez|1961|p=86-87}}</ref><ref name=margotta73> {{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=73}} </ref> The centuries after Hippocrates's death were marked as much by retrograde movement as by further advancement. For instance, "after the Hippocratic period, the practice of taking clinical case-histories died out...", according to [[Fielding H. Garrison|Fielding Garrison]].<ref name=garrison95> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=95}}</ref>

After Hippocrates, the next significant physician was [[Galen]], a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] who lived from 129 to 200 AD. Galen perpetuated Hippocratic medicine, moving both forward and backward.<ref name=jones35> {{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=35}} </ref> In the [[Middle Ages]], [[Arab]]s  adopted Hippocratic methods.<ref> {{Harvnb|Leff|Leff|1956|p=102}} </ref> After the [[European Renaissance]], Hippocratic methods were revived in Europe and even further expanded in the 19th century. Notable among those who employed Hippocrates's rigorous clinical techniques were [[Thomas Sydenham|Sydenham]], [[William Heberden|Heberden]], [[Jean-Martin Charcot|Charcot]] and [[William Osler|Osler]]. [[Henri Huchard]], a French physician, said that these revivals make up "the whole history of internal medicine".<ref name=garrison934 />

===Image===
[[Image:Hippocrates.jpg|thumb|240px|A conventionalized image in a Roman "portrait" bust (19th century engraving)]]
According to [[Aristotle]]'s testimony, Hippocrates was known as "the Great Hippocrates".<ref name=jones38> {{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=38}} </ref> Concerning his disposition, Hippocrates was first portrayed as a "kind, dignified, old country doctor'" and later as "stern and forbidding".<ref name=marti86 /> He is certainly considered wise, of very great intellect and especially as very practical. [[Francis Adams (translator)|Francis Adams]] describes him as "strictly the physician of experience and common sense".<ref name=adams15> {{Harvnb|Adams|1891|p=15}} </ref>

His image as the wise, old doctor is reinforced by busts of him, which wear large beards on a wrinkled face. Many physicians of the time wore their hair in the style of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jove]] and Asklepius. Accordingly, the busts of Hippocrates that we have could be only altered versions of portraits of these deities.<ref name=garrison100> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=100}}</ref> Hippocrates and the beliefs that he embodied are considered medical ideals. [[Fielding Garrison]], an authority on medical history, stated, "He is, above all, the exemplar of that flexible, critical, well-poised attitude of mind, ever on the lookout for sources of error, which is the very essence of the scientific spirit".<ref name=garrison934> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=94}} </ref> "His figure... stands for all time as that of the ideal physician<U+201D>, according to ''A Short History of Medicine'', inspiring the medical profession since his death.<ref name=sing29> {{Harvnb|Singer|Underwood|1962|p=29}} </ref>

Some stories of Hippocrates's life are likely to be untrue because of their inconsistency with historical evidence, and because similar or identical stories are told of other figures such as [[Avicenna]] and [[Socrates]], suggesting a legendary origin.<!--could not understand what the preceeding sentence means--> Even during his life, Hippocrates's renown was great, and stories of miraculous cures arose. For example, Hippocrates was supposed to have aided in the healing of Athenians during the [[Plague of Athens]] by lighting great fires as "disinfectants" and engaging in other treatments. There is a story of Hippocrates curing [[Perdiccas II of Macedon|Perdiccas]], a [[Macedon|Macedonian]] king, of "[[love sickness]]". Neither of these accounts is corroborated by any historians and they are thus unlikely to have ever occurred.<ref name=adams1011> {{Harvnb|Adams|1891|p=10<U+2013>11}} </ref><ref name=jones37> {{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=37}} </ref><ref name=dictionary> {{Harvnb|Smith|1870|p=483}} </ref> Even the honey from a beehive on his grave was believed to have healing powers.<ref name=marti86> {{Harvnb|Mart<U+00ED>-Ib<U+00E1><U+00F1>ez|1961|p=86-87}}</ref><ref name=margotta73> {{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=73}} </ref>
[[Image:Plane tree of Hippocrates.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Tree of Hippocrates|Plane Tree of Hippocrates]], under which Hippocrates is said to have worked.<ref name=NHLtree> {{Harvnb|National Library of Medicine|2000}} </ref>]]
Another legend concerns how Hippocrates rejected a formal request to visit the court of [[Artaxerxes]], the [[King of Persia]].<ref name=pinault> {{Harvnb|Pinault|1992|p=1}}</ref> The validity of this is accepted by ancient sources but denied by some modern ones, and is thus under contention.<ref name=adams1213> {{Harvnb|Adams|1891|p=12<U+2013>13}} </ref> Another tale states that [[Democritus]] was supposed to be mad because he laughed at everything, and so he was sent to Hippocrates to be cured. Hippocrates diagnosed him as having a merely happy disposition. Democritus has since been called "the laughing philosopher".<ref> {{Harvnb|Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|2006}} </ref>

Not all stories of Hippocrates portrayed him in a positive manner. In one legend, Hippocrates is said have fled after setting fire to a [[healing temple]] in Greece. [[Soranus (Greek Physician)|Soranus]] of [[Ephesus]], the source of this story, names the temple as the one of [[Knidos]]. However centuries later, the [[Byzantine]] Greek grammarian [[John Tzetzes]], writes that Hippocrates burned down his own temple, the [[Temple of Cos]], speculating that he did it to maintain a [[monopoly]] of medical knowledge. This account is very much in conflict with traditional estimations of Hippocrates's personality. Other legends tell of his [[resurrection]] of [[Augustus]]'s nephew; this feat was supposedly created by the erection of a statue of Hippocrates and the establishment of a professorship in his honor in Rome.<!--please try to break up/elucidate the preceeding sentence--><ref name=dictionary/><ref name=adams1011> {{Harvnb|Adams|1891|p=10<U+2013>11}} </ref><ref name=margotta66> {{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=66}}<ref name=jones24> {{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=24}} </ref>

==Namesakes==
Some clinical symptoms and signs have been named after Hippocrates as he is believed to be the first person to describe those. [[Hippocratic face]] is the change produced in the countenance by death, or long sickness, excessive evacuations, excessive hunger, and the like. [[Clubbing]], a deformity of the fingers and fingernails, is also known as Hippocratic fingers. [[Hippocratic succussion]] is the internal splashing noise of [[hydropneumothorax]] or [[pyopneumothorax]]. [[Hippocratic bench]] (a device which uses tension to aid in setting bones) and [[Hippocratic cap-shaped bandage]] are two devices named after Hippocrates.<ref name=Fishchenko> {{Harvnb|Fishchenko|Khimich|1986}} </ref> [[Hippocratic Corpus]] and [[Hippocratic Oath]] are also his namesakes. The drink [[hypocras]] is also believed to be invented by Hippocrates.
