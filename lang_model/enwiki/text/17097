'''Asthma''' is a chronic [[disease]] of the [[respiratory system]] in which the [[Lung|airway]] occasionally constricts, becomes inflamed, and is lined with excessive amounts of mucus, often in response to one or more triggers. These episodes may be triggered by such things as exposure to an environmental stimulant (or [[allergen]]), cold air, [[exercise]] or exertion, or emotional [[stress (medicine)|stress]]. In children, the most common triggers are viral illnesses such as those that cause the common cold.<!--

''J Pediatr Allergy Immunol''. 2002 Feb;13(1):47-50. PMID 12000498</ref>  This airway narrowing causes [[symptom]]s such as [[wheezing]], [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], chest tightness, and [[cough|coughing]], which respond to [[bronchodilators]]. Between episodes, most patients feel mostly ok but can have a slight problem feeling out of breath for longer periods of time.  

The disorder is a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] or recurring [[inflammation|inflammatory]] condition in which the [[lung|airway]] develops increased responsiveness to various stimuli, characterized by [[bronchus|bronchial]] hyper-responsiveness, [[allergic Inflammation|inflammation]], increased [[mucus]] production, and intermittent airway obstruction. The symptoms of asthma, which can range from mild to life threatening, can usually be controlled with a combination of [[medication|drugs]] and environmental changes.

Public attention in the [[developed country|developed world]] has recently focused on asthma because of its rapidly increasing [[prevalence]], affecting up to one in four urban children.<!--

==History==
The word ''asthma'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''aazein'', meaning "sharp breath." The word first appears in Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'';<!--
  --><ref name=Marketos>Marketos SG, Ballas CN. Bronchial asthma in the medical literature of Greek antiquity. ''J Asthma''. 1982;19(4):263-9. PMID 6757243</ref>
[[Hippocrates]] was the first to use it in reference to the medical condition, in 450 BC. Hippocrates thought that the spasms associated with asthma were more likely to occur in tailors, anglers, and metalworkers. Six centuries later, [[Galen]] wrote much about asthma, noting that it was caused by partial or complete bronchial obstruction. In 1190 AD, [[Moses Maimonides]], an influential medieval [[rabbi]], philosopher, and physician, wrote a treatise on asthma, describing its prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.<!--
  --><ref name=Rosner>Rosner F. Moses Maimonides' treatise on asthma. ''Thorax''. 1981;36:245-251. PMID 7025335</ref>
In the 17th century, [[Bernardino Ramazzini]] noted a connection between asthma and [[organic compound|organic]] dust. The use of [[bronchodilator]]s started in 1901, but it was not until the 1960s that the inflammatory component of asthma was recognized, and [[anti-inflammatory]] medications were added to the regimen.

==Signs and symptoms==

In some individuals asthma is characterized by chronic respiratory impairment.  In others it is an intermittent illness marked by episodic symptoms that may result from a number of triggering events, including upper respiratory infection, stress, airborne allergens, air pollutants (such as smoke), or exercise.

An acute exacerbation of asthma is referred to as an ''asthma attack''. The clinical hallmarks of an attack are shortness of breath ([[dyspnea]]) and either [[wheeze|wheezing]] or [[stridor]]. Although the former is "often regarded as the ''[[sine qua non]]'' of asthma,"<!--
  --><ref name=McFadden>McFadden ER, Jr. Asthma. In Kasper DL, Fauci AS, Longo DL, et al (eds). ''Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine'' (16th Edition), pp. 1508-1516. New York: McGraw-Hill;2004.</ref>
some victims present primarily with [[cough]]ing, and in the late stages of an attack, air motion may be so impaired that no wheezing may be heard. When present the cough may sometimes produce clear [[sputum]]. The onset may be sudden, with a sense of constriction in the chest, breathing becomes difficult, and wheezing occurs (primarily upon expiration, but can be in both [[Respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] phases).   

[[Sign (medicine)|Signs]] of an asthmatic episode include [[wheeze|wheezing]], rapid breathing ([[tachypnea]]), prolonged expiration, a rapid heart rate ([[tachycardia]]), [[rhonchus|rhonchous]] lung sounds (audible through a [[stethoscope]]), and over-inflation of the chest. During a serious asthma attack, the accessory [[muscle]]s of respiration (sternocleidomastoid and scalene muscles of the neck) may be used, shown as in-drawing of [[biological tissue|tissue]]s between the ribs and above the [[sternum]] and [[clavicle]]s, and the presence of a [[paradoxical pulse]] (a pulse that is weaker during inhalation and stronger during exhalation).

During very severe attacks, an asthma sufferer can turn blue from lack of oxygen, and can experience [[chest pain]] or even loss of [[consciousness]]. Just before loss of consciousness, there is a chance that the patient will feel numbness in the limbs and palms may start to sweat. Feet may become icy cold. Severe asthma attacks may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Despite the severity of symptoms during an asthmatic episode, between attacks an asthmatic may show few signs of the disease.

==Diagnosis==
In most cases, a physician can [[diagnosis|diagnose]] asthma on the basis of typical findings in a patient's clinical history and examination. Asthma is strongly suspected if a patient suffers from [[eczema]] or other [[allergy|allergic]] conditions<U+2014>suggesting a general [[atopy|atopic constitution]]<U+2014>or has a [[Family history (medicine)|family history]] of asthma. While measurement of airway function is possible for adults, most new cases are diagnosed in children who are unable to perform such tests. Diagnosis in children is based on a careful compilation and analysis of the patient's [[medical history]] and subsequent improvement with an inhaled [[bronchodilator]] medication. In adults, diagnosis can be made with a [[peak flow meter]] (which tests airway restriction), looking at both the [[diel|diurnal]] [[Circadian rhythm|variation]] and any reversibility following inhaled [[bronchodilator]] [[Asthma#Rapid relief|medication]]. 

Testing peak flow at rest (or baseline) and after exercise can be helpful, especially in young asthmatics who may experience only [[exercise-induced asthma]]. If the diagnosis is in doubt, a more formal [[spirometry|lung function test]] may be conducted. Once a diagnosis of asthma is made, a patient can use [[peak flow meter]] testing to monitor the severity of the disease.

===Differential diagnosis===
Before diagnosing someone as asthmatic, [[differential diagnosis|alternative possibilities]] should be considered. A physician taking a history should check whether the patient is using any known bronchoconstrictors (substances that cause narrowing of the airways, e.g., certain [[anti-inflammatory]] agents or [[beta-blockers]]).

[[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], which closely resembles asthma, is correlated with more exposure to cigarette smoke, an older patient, less symptom reversibility after bronchodilator administration (as measured by [[spirometry]]), and decreased likelihood of family history of [[atopy]].

[[Pulmonary aspiration]], whether '''direct''' due to [[dysphagia]] (swallowing disorder) or '''indirect''' (due to acid reflux), can show similar symptoms to asthma. However, with aspiration, fevers might also indicate [[aspiration pneumonia]]. Direct aspiration (dysphagia) can be diagnosed by performing a Modified Barium Swallow test and treated with feeding therapy by a qualified [[speech therapist]]. If the aspiration is indirect (from acid reflux) then treatment directed at this is indicated.

Only a minority of asthma sufferers have an identifiable [[allergy]] trigger. The majority of these triggers can often be identified from the history; for instance, asthmatics with [[hay fever]] or [[pollen]] allergy will have seasonal symptoms, those with allergies to [[pet]]s may experience an abatement of symptoms when away from home, and those with occupational asthma may improve during leave from work. Occasionally, [[allergy#Diagnosis|allergy tests]] are warranted and, if positive, may help in identifying avoidable symptom triggers. 

After pulmonary function has been measured, radiological tests, such as a [[chest X-ray]] or [[computed tomography|CT scan]], may be required to exclude the possibility of other lung diseases. In some people, asthma may be triggered by [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]], which can be treated with suitable [[antacid]]s. Very occasionally, specialized tests after inhalation of [[methacholine challenge test|methacholine]] <U+2014> or, even less commonly, [[histamine]] <U+2014> may be performed.

Asthma is categorized by the United States [[National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute]] as falling into one of four categories: mild intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent and severe persistent.  The diagnosis of "severe persistent asthma" occurs when symptoms are continual with frequent exacerbations and frequent nighttime symptoms, result in limited physical activity and when lung function as measured by PEV or FEV1 tests is less than 60% predicted with PEF variability greater than 30%.

There is no cure for asthma. Doctors have only found ways to prevent attacks and relieve the symptoms such as tightness of the chest and trouble breathing.

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:Asthma before-after.png|thumb|right|470px|'''Inflamed airways and bronchoconstriction in asthma'''. Airways narrowed as a result of the inflammatory response cause wheezing.]]
===Bronchoconstriction===
During an asthma episode, inflamed [[bronchiole|airways]] react to environmental triggers such as smoke, dust, or pollen. The airways narrow and produce excess [[mucus]], making it difficult to breathe.
In essence, asthma is the result of an [[immune response]] in the [[bronchial]] airways.<ref name=Maddox>Maddox L, Schwartz DA. The Pathophysiology of Asthma. ''Annu. Rev. Med.'' 2002, 53:477-98. PMID 11818486</ref>

The airways of asthmatics are "[[hypersensitivity|hypersensitive]]" to certain triggers, also known as ''stimuli'' (see below). In response to exposure to these triggers, the [[bronchi]] (large airways) contract into [[spasm]] (an "asthma attack"). [[Inflammation]] soon follows, leading to a further narrowing of the airways and excessive [[mucus]] production, which leads to coughing and other breathing difficulties.

There are several categories of stimuli: 
*[[allergen]]ic [[Pollution|air pollution]], from nature, typically inhaled, which include waste from common household insects, such as the [[house dust mite]] and [[cockroach]], [[pollen|grass pollen]], [[mould]] spores and pet [[epithelium|epithelial cells]]; 
*[[medication]]s, including [[aspirin]]<!--
  --><ref name=Jenkins>Jenkins C, Costello J, Hodge L. [[Systematic review]] of prevalence of aspirin induced asthma and its implications for clinical practice. ''[[British Medical Journal|BMJ]]'' 2004;328:434. PMID 14976098</ref><!--
--> and [[beta blocker|<U+03B2>-adrenergic antagonist]]s (beta blockers); 
*Use of [[fossil fuel]] related [[allergen]]ic [[Pollution|air pollution]], such as [[ozone]], [[smog]], [[summer smog]], [[nitrogen dioxide]], and [[sulfur dioxide]], which is thought to be one of the major reasons for the high prevalence of asthma in [[Urban area|urban]] areas;
*various industrial compounds and other chemicals, notably [[sulfites]]; [[chlorine|chlorinated]] swimming pools generate [[chloramine]]s<U+2014>monochloramine (NH<sub>2</sub>Cl), dichloramine (NHCl<sub>2</sub>) and trichloramine (NCl<sub>3</sub>)<U+2014>in the air around them, which are known to induce asthma.<!--
  --><ref name=Nemery>Nemery B, Hoet PH, Nowak D. Indoor swimming pools, water chlorination and respiratory health. ''Eur Respir J''. 2002;19(5):790-3. PMID 12030714</ref>
*early childhood [[infection]]s, especially [[virus|viral]] [[URTI|respiratory infections]].  However, persons of any age can have asthma triggered by colds and other respiratory infections even though their normal stimuli might be from another category (e.g. pollen) and absent at the time of infection. 80% of asthma attacks in adults and 60% in children are caused by respiratory viruses.
*[[exercise]], the effects of which differ somewhat from those of the other triggers;
* (in some countries) - [[allergen]]ic indoor [[Pollution|air pollution]] from [[newsprint]] & other literature such as, [[Direct marketing|junk mail]] leaflets & glossy [[magazine]]s.
*Hormonal changes in adolescent girls and adult women associated with their menstrual cycle can lead to a worsening of asthma.  Some women also experience a worsening of their asthma during pregnancy whereas others find no significant changes, and in other women their asthma improves during their pregnancy.
*[[stress (medicine)|emotional stress]] which is poorly understood as a trigger.

===Bronchial inflammation===
The mechanisms behind allergic asthma<U+2014>i.e., asthma resulting from an [[immune response]] to inhaled [[allergen]]s<U+2014>are the best understood of the causal factors. In both asthmatics and non-asthmatics, inhaled allergens that find their way to the inner [[bronchiole|airways]] are [[phagocytosis|ingested]] by a type of cell known as [[antigen presenting cell]]s, or APCs. APCs then "present" pieces of the allergen to other [[immune system]] cells. In most people, these other immune cells ([[T helper cell|T<sub>H</sub>0 cells]]) "check" and usually ignore the allergen molecules. In asthmatics, however, these cells [[differentiation|transform]] into a different type of cell (T<sub>H</sub>2), for reasons that are not well understood. The resultant T<sub>H</sub>2 cells activate an important arm of the immune system, known as the [[humoral immunity|humoral immune system]]. The humoral immune system produces [[antibody|antibodies]] against the inhaled allergen. Later, when an asthmatic inhales the same allergen, these antibodies "recognize" it and activate a [[Humoral immune response|humoral response]]. [[Inflammation]] results: chemicals are produced that cause the airways to constrict and release more mucus, and the cell-mediated arm of the immune system is activated. The inflammatory response is responsible for the clinical manifestations of an asthma attack. The following section describes this complex series of events in more detail.

===Pathogenesis===
The fundamental problem in asthma appears to be [[immunology|immunological]]: young children in the early stages of asthma show signs of excessive inflammation in their airways. [[Epidemiology|Epidemiological findings]] give clues as to the [[pathogenesis]]: the incidence of asthma seems to be increasing worldwide, and asthma is now very much more common in affluent countries.

In 1968 Andor Szentivanyi first described ''The Beta Adrenergic Theory of Asthma''; in which blockage of the Beta-2 receptors of pulmonary smooth muscle cells causes asthma.<!--

====Causes====
Many studies have linked asthma, [[bronchitis]], and acute respiratory illnesses to air quality experienced by children.<ref name=asthma_air_quality>{{cite web | url = http://ewg.org/sites/asthmaindex/about/kidshealth.php | title = Asthma and Air Quality}}</ref> One of the largest of these studies is the California Children's Health Study.<ref name=childrens_health_study>{{cite web | url = http://www.arb.ca.gov/research/chs/chs.htm | title = California Children's Health Study}}</ref> From the press release [http://www.arb.ca.gov/newsrel/nr013102.htm]<blockquote>The study showed that children in the high ozone communities who played three or more sports developed asthma at a rate three times higher than those in the low ozone communities. Because participation in some sports can result in a child drawing up to 17 times the <U+201C>normal<U+201D> amount of air into the lungs, young athletes are more likely to develop asthma.</blockquote>
Note that concentrations of ozone have risen steadily in Europe since 1870. [http://www.eoearth.org/image/Histconc.gif] 

Another theory of [[pathogenesis]] is that asthma is a disease of hygiene. In nature, babies are exposed to [[bacteria]] and other [[antigen]]s soon after birth, "switching on" the T<sub>H</sub>1 [[lymphocyte]] cells of the [[immune system]] that deal with bacterial infection. If this stimulus is insufficient, as it may be in modern, clean environments, then T<sub>H</sub>2 cells predominate, and asthma and other allergic diseases may develop. This "[[hygiene hypothesis]]" may explain the increase in asthma in affluent populations. The T<sub>H</sub>2 lymphocytes and [[eosinophil]] cells that protect us against [[parasite]]s and other infectious agents are the same cells responsible for the allergic reaction. The Charcot-Leyden crystals are formed when the crystalline material in eosinophils coalesce. These crystals are significant in sputum samples of people with asthma. In the developed world, these [[parasite]]s are now rarely encountered, but the immune response remains and is wrongly triggered in some individuals by certain allergens.

Finally, it has been postulated that some forms of asthma may be related to infection, in particular by ''[[Chlamydophila pneumoniae|Chlamydia pneumoniae]]''.<!--

{{main|gastro-esophageal reflux disease}}
If gastro-esophageal reflux disease is present, the patient may have repetitive episodes of acid aspiration, which results in airway inflammation and "irritant-induced" asthma.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} GERD may be common in difficult-to-control asthma, but generally speaking, treating it does not seem to affect the asthma.<ref name=Leggett_et_al_2005>{{cite journal | last = Leggett | first = Julian J. | coauthors = Brian T.

==Treatment==
The most effective treatment for asthma is identifying triggers, such as pets or aspirin, and limiting or eliminating exposure to them. [[Desensitization]] to allergens has been shown to be a treatment option for certain patients.<ref>American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine 1995;151:969-74.</ref>

As is common with respiratory disease, [[tobacco smoking|smoking]] adversely affects asthmatics in several ways, including an increased severity of symptoms, a more rapid decline of lung function, and decreased response to preventive medications.<ref name=thomson>Thomson NC, Spears M. The influence of smoking on the treatment response in patients with asthma. ''Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol''. 2005;5(1):57-63. PMID 15643345</ref>
Asthmatics who smoke typically require additional medications to help control their disease. Furthermore, exposure of both non-smokers and smokers to [[second-hand smoke]] is detrimental, resulting in more severe asthma, more [[emergency room]] visits, and more asthma-related hospital admissions.<ref name=eisner>Eisner MD, Yelin EH, Katz PP, ''et al.'' Exposure to indoor combustion and adult asthma outcomes: environmental tobacco smoke, gas stoves, and wood-smoke. ''Thorax''. 2002;57(11):973-8. PMID 12403881</ref>
Smoking cessation and avoidance of second-hand smoke is strongly encouraged in asthmatics.<ref name=epr2>National Asthma Education and Prevention Program. ''Expert Panel Report: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma''. National Institutes of Health pub no 97-4051. Bethesda, MD, 1997. ([http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/asthma/asthgdln.pdf PDF])</ref>

The specific medical treatment recommended to patients with asthma depends on the severity of their illness and the frequency of their symptoms. Specific treatments for asthma are broadly classified as relievers, preventers and emergency treatment. The ''Expert Panel Report 2: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma'' (EPR-2)<!--
  --><ref name=epr2 />
of the U.S. National Asthma Education and Prevention Program, and the ''British Guideline on the Management of Asthma''<!--

are broadly used and supported by many doctors. Bronchodilators are recommended for short-term relief in all patients. For those who experience occasional attacks, no other medication is needed. For those with mild persistent disease (more than two attacks a week), low-dose inhaled glucocorticoids or alternatively, an oral leukotriene modifier, a mast-cell stabilizer, or theophylline may be administered. For those who suffer daily attacks, a higher dose of glucocorticoid in conjunction with a long-acting inhaled <U+03B2>-2 agonist may be prescribed; alternatively, a leukotriene modifier or theophylline may substitute for the <U+03B2>-2 agonist. In severe asthmatics, oral glucocorticoids may be added to these treatments during severe attacks.

For those in whom exercise can trigger an asthma attack ([[exercise-induced asthma]]), higher levels of ventilation and cold, dry air tend to exacerbate attacks. For this reason, activities in which a patient breathes large amounts of cold air, such as skiing and running, tend to be worse for asthmatics, whereas swimming in an indoor, heated pool, with warm, humid air, is less likely to provoke a response.<!--

Researchers at Harvard Medical School (HMS) have come up with convincing evidence that the answer to what causes asthma lies in a special type of natural "killer" cell. This finding means that physicians may not be treating asthma sufferers with the right kinds of drugs.

A novel therapeutic target currently under investigation is the A<sub>2B</sub> receptor, a cell surface G-protein coupled receptor expressed in the lungs and in inflammatory cells expressed in asthma.

===Relief medication===
Symptomatic control of episodes of wheezing and shortness of breath is generally achieved with fast-acting [[bronchodilator]]s. These are typically provided in pocket-sized, metered-dose [[inhaler]]s (MDIs). In young sufferers, who may have difficulty with the coordination necessary to use inhalers, or those with a poor ability to hold their breath for 10 seconds after inhaler use (generally the elderly), an [[asthma spacer]] (see top image) is used. The spacer is a plastic cylinder that mixes the medication with air in a simple tube, making it easier for patients to receive a full dose of the drug and allows for the active agent to be dispersed into smaller, more fully inhaled bits. A [[nebulizer]] which provides a larger, continuous dose can also be used. Nebulizers work by vaporizing a dose of medication in a saline solution into a steady stream of foggy vapour, which the patient inhales continuously until the full dosage is administered. There is no clear evidence, however, that they are more effective than inhalers used with a spacer. Nebulizers may be helpful to some patients experiencing a severe attack. Such patients may not be able to inhale deeply, so regular inhalers may not deliver medication deeply into the lungs, even on repeated attempts. Since a nebulizer delivers the medication continuously, it is thought that the first few inhalations may relax the airways enough to allow the following inhalations to draw in more medication.  

Relievers include:
* Short-acting, selective [[Beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist|beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonists]], such as [[salbutamol]] (''albuterol'' [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]), [[levalbuterol]], [[terbutaline]] and  [[bitolterol]].<br>[[tremor|Tremors]], the major side effect, have been greatly reduced by inhaled delivery, which allows the drug to target the lungs specifically; oral and injected medications are delivered throughout the body. There may also be [[cardiac]] side effects at higher doses (due to Beta-1 agonist activity), such as elevated heart rate or blood pressure; with the advent of selective agents, these side effects have become less common. Patients must be cautioned against using these medicines too frequently, as with such use their efficacy may decline, producing [[desensitization]] resulting in an exacerbation of symptoms which may lead to refractory asthma and death.
* Older, less selective [[adrenergic receptor|adrenergic agonists]], such as inhaled [[epinephrine]] and [[ephedrine]] tablets, are available over the counter in the US. Cardiac side effects occur with these agents at either similar or lesser rates to albuterol.<!--

PMID 16490653</ref>  When used solely as a relief medication, inhaled epinephrine has been shown to be an effective agent to terminate an acute asthmatic exacerbation.<ref name="Hendeles" />  In emergencies, these drugs were sometimes administered by injection.  Their use via injection has declined due to related adverse effects.
*[[Anticholinergic]] medications, such as [[ipratropium bromide]] may be used instead. They have no cardiac side effects and thus can be used in patients with heart disease; however, they take up to an hour to achieve their full effect and are not as powerful as the <U+03B2><sub>2</sub>-adrenoreceptor agonists.

===Prevention medication===
Current treatment protocols recommend prevention medications such as an inhaled [[corticosteroid]], which helps to suppress [[inflammation]] and reduces the swelling of the lining of the airways, in anyone who has frequent (greater than twice a week) need of relievers or who has severe symptoms. If symptoms persist, additional preventive drugs are added until the asthma is controlled. With the proper use of prevention drugs, asthmatics can avoid the complications that result from overuse of relief medications.

Asthmatics sometimes stop taking their preventive medication when they feel fine and have no problems breathing. This often results in further attacks, and no long-term improvement.

Preventive agents include the following.
* Inhaled [[glucocorticoid]]s are the most widely used of the prevention medications and normally come as inhaler devices ([[ciclesonide]], [[beclomethasone]], [[budesonide]],  [[flunisolide]], [[fluticasone]], [[mometasone furoate|mometasone]], and [[triamcinolone]]).<br>Long-term use of corticosteroids can have many side effects including a redistribution of fat, increased [[appetite]], blood [[glucose]] problems and weight gain. In particular high doses of steroids may cause [[osteoporosis]]. For this reasons inhaled steroids are generally used for prevention, as their smaller doses are targeted to the lungs unlike the higher doses of oral preparations. Nevertheless, patients on high doses of inhaled steroids may still require prophylactic treatment to prevent osteoporosis.<br>Deposition of steroids in the mouth may cause a [[dysphonia|hoarse voice]] or [[oral thrush]] (due to decreased immunity). This may be minimised by rinsing the mouth with water after inhaler use, as well as by using a [[spacer]] which increases the amount of drug that reaches the lungs.
* [[Leukotriene]] modifiers ([[montelukast]], [[zafirlukast]], [[pranlukast]], and [[zileuton]]).
* [[Mast cell]] stabilizers ([[cromoglicate]] (cromolyn), and [[nedocromil]]).
* Antimuscarinics/anticholinergics ([[ipratropium]], [[oxitropium]], and [[tiotropium]]), which have a mixed reliever and preventer effect. (These are rarely used in preventive treatment of asthma, except in patients who do not tolerate beta-2-agonists.)
* Methylxanthines ([[theophylline]] and [[aminophylline]]), which are sometimes considered if sufficient control cannot be achieved with inhaled glucocorticoids and long-acting <U+03B2>-agonists alone.
* [[Antihistamine]]s, often used to treat allergic symptoms that may underlie the chronic inflammation.  In more severe cases, [[hyposensitization]] ("allergy shots") may be recommended.
* [[Omalizumab]], an [[immunoglobulin E|IgE]] blocker; this can help patients with severe allergic asthma that does not respond to other drugs. However, it is expensive and must be injected.
* [[Methotrexate]] is occasionally used in some difficult-to-treat patients.
* If chronic acid indigestion ([[Gastroesophageal reflux disease|GERD]]) contributes to a patient's asthma, it should also be treated, because it may prolong the respiratory problem.

Additionally, the antidepressant [[tianeptine]] has shown significant efficacy in children with asthma.

===Long-acting <U+03B2><sub>2</sub>-agonists===
[[Image:AsthmaInhaler.jpg|thumb|180px|A typical [[inhaler]], of [[salmeterol|Serevent (salmeterol)]], a long-acting bronchodilator.]]
Long-acting bronchodilators (LABD) are similar in structure to short-acting selective beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonists, but have much longer sidechains resulting in a 12-hour effect, and are used to give a smoothed symptomatic relief (used morning and night). While patients report improved symptom control, these drugs do not replace the need for routine preventers, and their slow onset means the short-acting dilators may still be required. In November of 2005, the American [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] released a health advisory alerting the public to findings that show the use of long-acting <U+03B2><sub>2</sub>-agonists could lead to a worsening of symptoms, and in some cases death.<!--
  --><ref name=FDA"LABD">{{cite web | year=[[2006-03-03]] | title=Serevent Diskus, Advair Diskus, and Foradil Information (Long Acting Beta Agonists) - Drug information | publisher=FDA | url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/LABA/default.htm}}</ref>

Currently available [[long acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist|long-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonists]] include [[salmeterol]], [[formoterol]], [[bambuterol]], and sustained-release oral [[albuterol]]. Combinations of inhaled steroids and long-acting bronchodilators are becoming more widespread; the most common combination currently in use is fluticasone/salmeterol ([[Advair]] in the United States, and [[Seretide]] in the United Kingdom).

A recent meta-analysis of the roles of long-acting beta-agonists may indicate a danger to asthma patients. "These agents can improve symptoms through bronchodilation at the same time as increasing underlying inflammation and bronchial hyper-responsiveness, thus worsening asthma control without any warning of increased symptoms," said Shelley Salpeter in a Cornell study. The study goes on to say that "Three common asthma inhalers containing the drugs salmeterol or formoterol may be causing four out of five US asthma-related deaths per year and should be taken off the market".<ref name=Down_with_Serevent>{{cite web | first = Krishna | last = Ramanujan | title = Common asthma inhalers cause up to 80 percent of asthma-related deaths, Cornell and Stanford researchers assert | url = http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/June06/AsthmaDeaths.kr.html | work = Cornell Chronicle Online | publisher = Cornell News Service | date = 2006-06-09 | accessdate = 2006-09-23}}</ref>

===Emergency treatment===
When an asthma attack is unresponsive to a patient's usual medication, other treatments are available to the physician or hospital:<!--
  --><ref name=rodrigo>Rodrigo GJ, Rodrigo C, Hall JB. Acute asthma in adults: a review. ''Chest''. 2004;125(3):1081-102. PMID 15006973</ref> 
* [[oxygen]] to alleviate the hypoxia (but not the asthma ''per se'') that results from extreme asthma attacks; 
* nebulized [[salbutamol]] or [[terbutaline]] (short-acting beta-2-agonists), often combined with ipratropium (an anticholinergic);
* systemic steroids, oral or intravenous ([[prednisone]], [[prednisolone]], [[methylprednisolone]], [[dexamethasone]], or [[hydrocortisone]])
* other bronchodilators that are occasionally effective when the usual drugs fail:
** intravenous salbutamol
** nonspecific beta-agonists, injected or inhaled ([[epinephrine]], [[isoetharine]], [[isoproterenol]], [[metaproterenol]]);
** anticholinergics, IV or nebulized, with systemic effects ([[glycopyrrolate]], [[atropine]], [[ipratropium]]);
** methylxanthines ([[theophylline]], [[aminophylline]]);
** inhalation anesthetics that have a bronchodilatory effect ([[isoflurane]], [[halothane]], [[enflurane]]);
** the dissociative anaesthetic [[ketamine]], often used in [[endotracheal tube]] induction
** [[magnesium sulfate]], intravenous; and
* intubation and mechanical ventilation, for patients in or approaching respiratory arrest.

===Alternative and complementary medicine===
Many asthmatics, like those who suffer from other chronic disorders, use alternative treatments; surveys show that roughly 50% of asthma patients use some form of unconventional therapy.<!--

There are little data to support the effectiveness of most of these therapies. A [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane]] [[Evidence-based medicine|systematic review]] of acupuncture for asthma found no evidence of efficacy.<!--

A similar review of [[air ioniser]]s found no evidence that they improve asthma symptoms or benefit lung function; this applied equally to positive and negative ion generators.<!--
  --><ref name=blackhall>Blackhall K, Appleton S, Cates CJ. Ionisers for chronic asthma. ''Cochrane Database Syst Rev.'' 2003;(3):CD002986 PMID 12917939</ref>
A study of "manual therapies" for asthma, including [[osteopathic]], [[chiropractic]], [[physiotherapy|physiotherapeutic]] and [[respiratory therapy|respiratory therapeutic]] manoeuvers, found there is insufficient evidence to support or refute their use in treating asthma;<!--
  --><ref name=hondras>Hondras MA, Linde K, Jones AP. Manual therapy for asthma. ''Cochrane Database Syst Rev''. 2005;(2):CD001002. PMID 15846609</ref>
these manoeuvers include various osteopathic and chiropractic techniques to "increase movement in the rib cage and the spine to try and improve the working of the lungs and circulation"; chest tapping, shaking, vibration, and the use of "postures to help shift and cough up phlegm." On the other hand, one [[meta-analysis]] found that [[homeopathy]] has a potentially mild benefit in reducing symptom intensity;<!--

The [[Buteyko method]], a Russian therapy based on breathing exercises, has been investigated with mixed degrees of effect shown. A randomized, controlled trial of just 39 patients in 1998, suggested that it may moderately reduce the need for beta-agonists among asthmatics, but found no objective improvement in lung function.<!--

Given that some [[Hookworm#Hookworm in therapy|research]] has identified a negative association between [[helminth]] infection ([[hookworm]]) and asthma and hay fever, some have suggested that hookworm infestation, although not medically sanctioned, would cure asthma. There is anectdotal evidence to support this.<!--

[[Guaifenesin]], an expectorant available over the counter, is effective in managing thickened bronchial mucus.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for asthmatics is good, especially for children with mild disease. For asthmatics diagnosed during childhood, 54% will no longer carry the diagnosis after a decade. The extent of permanent lung damage in asthmatics is unclear. Airway remodelling is observed, but it is unknown whether these represent harmful or beneficial changes.<ref name=Maddox /> Although conclusions from studies are mixed, most studies show that early treatment with glucocorticoids prevents or ameliorates decline in lung function as measured by several parameters.<ref name=beckett>Beckett PA, Howarth PH. Pharmacotherapy and airway remodelling in asthma? ''Thorax''. 2003;58(2):163-74. PMID 12554904</ref>
For those who continue to suffer from mild symptoms, corticosteroids can help most to live their lives with few [[disabilities]]. The mortality rate for asthma is low, with around 6000 deaths per year in a population of some 10 million patients in the United States.<ref name=McFadden />
Better control of the condition may help prevent some of these deaths.

==Epidemiology==
[[Image:asthma_prevalence.png|thumb|right|350px|The [[prevalence]] of childhood asthma has increased since 1980, especially in younger children.]]
More than 6% of children in the United States have been diagnosed with asthma, a 75% increase in recent decades. The rate soars to 40% among some populations of urban children.
Asthma is usually diagnosed in childhood. The risk factors for asthma include:
*a personal or family [[history]] of asthma or [[atopy]];
*triggers (see ''[[Asthma#Pathophysiology|Pathophysiology]]'' above);
*premature birth or low birth weight; 
*viral [[URTI|respiratory infection]] in early childhood; 
*maternal smoking;  
*being male, for asthma in prepubertal children; and
*being female, for persistence of asthma into adulthood.

There is a reduced occurrence of asthma in people who were breast-fed as babies. Current research suggests that the [[prevalence]] of childhood asthma has been increasing. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]'s National Health Interview Surveys, some 9% of US children below 18 years of age had asthma in 2001, compared with just 3.6% in 1980 (see figure). The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) reports that some 8% of the Swiss population suffers from asthma today, compared with just 2% some 25<U+2013>30 years ago.<!--
  --><ref name=WHO>{{cite web |  author=World Health Organization | authorlink=World Health Organization | title=Bronchial asthma: scope of the problem | url=http://www.who.int/entity/respiratory/asthma/scope/en/index.html | accessdate=2005-08-23}}</ref>
Although asthma is more common in affluent countries, it is by no means a problem restricted to the affluent; the WHO estimate that there are between 15 and 20 million asthmatics in India. In the U.S., urban residents, Hispanics, and African Americans are affected more than the population as a whole. Globally, asthma is responsible for around 180,000 deaths annually.<!--
  --><ref name=WHO />

On the remote South Atlantic island [[Tristan da Cunha]], 50% of the population are asthmatics due to heredity transmission of a mutation in the gene CC16.

===Socioeconomic factors===

The incidence of asthma is higher among low-income populations within a society (even though it is more common in [[developed countries]] than [[developing countries]]), which in the western world are disproportionately minority, and more likely to live near industrial areas.  Additionally, asthma has been strongly associated with the presence of cockroaches in living quarters, which is more likely in such neighbourhoods.<!--
  --><ref name=AAAAAI>{{cite web | title=Patient/Public Education: Fast Facts - Asthma Demographics/Statistics | publisher= American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology | url=http://www.aaaai.org/patients/resources/fastfacts/asthma_demographics.stm | accessdate=2006-05-02}}</ref>

The quality of asthma treatment varies along racial lines, likely because many low-income people cannot afford health insurance and because there is still a correlation between class and race.  For example, black Americans are less likely to receive outpatient treatment for asthma despite having a higher prevalence of the disease. They are much more likely to have emergency room visits or hospitalization for asthma, and are three times as likely to die from an asthma attack compared to whites.  The prevalence of "severe persistent" asthma is also greater in low-income communities compared with communities with better access to treatment.<!--

===Asthma and athletics===
Asthma appears to be more prevalent in athletes than in the general population. One survey of participants in the 1996 [[Summer Olympic Games]], in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], U.S., showed that 15% had been diagnosed with asthma, and that 10% were on asthma medication.<!--
  --><ref name=olympics>Weiler JM, Layton T, Hunt M. Asthma in United States Olympic athletes who participated in the 1996 Summer Games. ''J Allergy Clin Immunol''. 1998;102(5):722-6. PMID 9819287</ref>
These statistics have been questioned on at least two bases. Athletes with mild asthma may be more likely to be diagnosed with the condition than non-athletes, because even subtle symptoms may interfere with their performance and lead to pursuit of a diagnosis. It has also been suggested that some professional athletes who do not suffer from asthma claim to do so in order to obtain special permits to use certain performance-enhancing drugs.

There appears to be a relatively high incidence of asthma in sports such as [[cycling]], mountain biking, and long-distance [[running]], and a relatively lower incidence in weightlifting and diving. It is unclear how much of these disparities are from the effects of training in the sport, and from self-selection of sports that may appear to minimize the triggering of asthma.<!--

  --><ref name=athletes>Helenius I, Haahtela T. Allergy and asthma in elite summer sport athletes. ''J Allergy Clin Immunol''. 2000;106(3):444-52 PMID 10984362</ref>

In addition, there exists a variant of asthma called [[exercise-induced asthma]] that shares many features with allergic asthma. It may occur either independently, or concurrent with the latter.  Exercise studies may be helpful in diagnosing and assessing this condition.
