'''C<U+00E9>line Marie Claudette Dion''', [[Order of Canada|OC]] [[National Order of Quebec|OQ]] (born [[March 30]] [[1968]]) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] and [[Juno Award|Juno]] award winning [[popular music|pop]] [[singer]] and occasional [[songwriter]].<ref>Britannica.com. ''[http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-9311022 C<U+00E9>line Dion]''. Retrieved [[January 13]], 2006.</ref> Born to a large, impoverished family in [[Charlemagne, Quebec|Charlemagne]], [[Quebec]], Dion became a young star in [[francophone]] Canada after her manager and future husband, [[Ren<U+00E9> Ang<U+00E9>lil]], [[mortgage|mortgaged]] his home to finance her first record. She later gained recognition in parts of Europe and Asia after she won both the 1982 Yamaha [[World Popular Song Festival]] and the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1988|1988 Eurovision Song Contest]].

In 1990 Dion established a foothold in the [[anglophone]] music market with the release of ''[[Unison (album)|Unison]]'', published by [[Epic Records]]. During the 1990s, she achieved worldwide fame and success with several English and French records, of which her most successful were ''[[Falling into You]]'' (1996), and "[[My Heart Will Go On]]" (1998) the theme to the 1997 film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''. In 1999 she announced a break from entertainment in order to focus on her husband, who was diagnosed with [[throat cancer]].

Three years later, Dion returned to the music scene with the release of ''[[A New Day Has Come]]''. By 2004 she had accumulated record sales of 175 million, and was presented with the [[Chopard Diamond award|Chopard Diamond Award]] from the [[World Music Awards]] show for becoming the [[Celine Dion awards and accomplishments|Best-selling Female Artist]] in the World.<ref>[http://www.chartattack.com/DAMN/2004/09/1303.cfm Chart Attack.com] "Celine Dion Named Queen of the World."

Dion's music has been influenced by various genres, which range from [[Pop music|pop]] and [[rock (music)|rock]] to [[Gospel music|gospel]] and [[European classical music|classical]], and she is noted for her technically skilled and powerful vocals.<ref name=cove>{{cite web | title=Cove Magazine| work= The 100 Outstanding Pop Vocalists| url=http://covemagazine.com/100vocalists.html| accessdate=August 29|accessyear=2006}}</ref> 

==Childhood and early career==
[[Image:Tellement.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Dion's performance at the [[Yamaha (manufacturer)|Yamaha]] [[World Popular Song Festival]] won her the gold medal as well as top performer]]

The youngest of fourteen children born to Adh<U+00E9>mar Dion and Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se Tanguay, Celine Dion was raised a [[Roman Catholic]] in a poverty-stricken but happy home in [[Charlemagne, Quebec|Charlemagne]], a small town about thirty miles from [[Montreal]]. She grew up singing with her siblings in her parents' small piano bar, 'Le Vieux Baril,' and had always dreamed of being a performer: in a 1994 interview with ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine, she recalled, "I missed my family and my home, but I don't regret having lost my [[adolescence]]. I had one dream: I wanted to be a singer." <ref>{{cite web | title=Rock on the Net | work= Celine Dion| url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-d/celinedion_main.htm| accessdate= November 30|accessyear=2005}}</ref>

At age twelve Dion collaborated with her mother and her brother Jacques to compose her first song, "[[Ce N'<U+00C9>tait Qu'un R<U+00EA>ve]]" ("It Was Only a Dream"). Her brother Michel sent the recording to music manager [[Ren<U+00E9> Ang<U+00E9>lil]], whose name he discovered on the back of a [[Ginette Reno]] album. Ang<U+00E9>lil was brought to tears by Dion's voice and decided to make her a star. He mortgaged his home to fund her first record, "[[La Voix du Bon Dieu]]" (a play on words "The Voice of God/The Road to God," 1981), which became a local number-one record and made Dion an instant star in Quebec. Her popularity spread to other parts of the world when she competed in the 1982 [[Yamaha (manufacturer)|Yamaha]] [[World Popular Song Festival]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], and won the musician's award for "Top Performer" as well as the gold medal for "Best Song" with "[[Tellement J'Ai d'Amour Pour Toi]]" ("I Have So Much Love for You"). By 1983 in addition to becoming the first Canadian artist to receive a gold record in France for the single "[[D'Amour Ou d'Amiti<U+00E9>]]" ("Of Love or of Friendship"), Dion had also won several [[F<U+00E9>lix Award|F<U+00E9>lix awards]], including "Best Female performer" and "Discovery of the year." Further success in Europe, Asia, and Australia came when Dion represented [[Switzerland]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1988|1988 Eurovision Song Contest]] with the song "[[Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi]]" ("Don't Go Without Me") and won the contest in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. However, American success was yet to come, partly due to her status as a Francophone artist.

At eighteen, after seeing a [[Michael Jackson]] performance, Dion told Ang<U+00E9>lil that she wanted to be a star like Jackson.<ref>[http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/dion_celine/bio.jhtml ''Celine Dion''] provided by [[VH1]].com Retrieved [[August 16]],[[2005]]</ref> Though confident in her talent, Angelil realized that her image needed to be changed in order for her to be marketed worldwide. Dion withdrew from the spotlight for a number of months, during which she underwent a physical makeover. Finally, Dion was sent to the <U+00C9>cole Berlitz School in 1989 to polish her English and interviewing skills. This marked the start of her anglophone career.

==Music and recording career==
===1990<U+2013>1992: Career breakthrough===

[[Image:Celine rocks.jpg|left|thumb|175px|Dion's earlier work consisted of strong rock music influences.]]

A year after she learned English, Dion made an attempt at breaking into the anglophone market with ''[[Unison (album)|Unison]]'' (1990). She incorporated the help of many established musicians, including Canadian [[music producer|producer]] [[David Foster]] and [[Vito Luprano]]. The album was largely influenced by 1980s [[soft rock]] that was fit for the [[adult contemporary]] radio format. ''Unison'' hit the right notes with critics: Jim Faber of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote that Dion's vocals were "tastefully unadorned," and that she never attempted to "bring off styles that are beyond her."<ref>{{cite web | title=Entertainment Weekly | work=Review--Celine Dion Unison | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/review/music/0,6115,313100_4_0_,00.html| accessdate=November 18| accessyear=2005}}</ref> Stephen Erlewine of ''[[All Music Guide]]'' declared it as "a fine, sophisticated American debut."<ref>{{cite web | title=All Music Guide | work=Review--Celine Dion Unison | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:6227gjlrj6in | accessdate=November 18| accessyear=2005}}</ref> Singles from the album included "[[(If There Was) Any Other Way]]," "[[The Last to Know]]," "[[Unison (song)|Unison]]," and "[[Where Does My Heart Beat Now]]," a mid-tempo soft-rock ballad which featured an [[electric guitar]]. The latter became her first single to chart on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100]], peaking at number four. The album established Dion as a rising singer in the United States, and across [[Continental Europe]] and Asia. In 1991, Dion was also a soloist in "[[Voices That Care]]", a tribute to American troops fighting in [[Operation Desert Storm]]; the single reached number 11 in the U.S.

While Dion was experiencing rising success in the U.S., her French fans in Canada criticized her for neglecting them. At the Felix Awards show, after winning "English Artist of the Year," she tried to reconnect with her French fans by refusing the award on the ground that she was <U+2014> and will always be <U+2014> a French, and not an English, artist.<ref>{{cite web | title=Celine Dion | work=Celine Dion Biography | url=http://www.celinedionweb.com/celine-dion/en,biography.html| accessdate=April 26| accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=The Canadian Encyclopedia | work=Celine Dion Biography | url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0000970

Dion's real international breakthrough came when she paired with [[Peabo Bryson]] to record the title track to [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s animated film ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991). The song captured a musical style that Dion would utilize in the future: sweeping, classically influenced ballads with soft instrumentation. Both a critical and commercial hit, the song became her second U.S. top ten single, and won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Song]], and the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]]. 
"[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 song)|Beauty and the Beast]]" was featured on Dion's 1992 ''[[Celine Dion (album)|eponymous album]]'', which, like her debut, had a strong rock influence combined with elements of soul and classical music. Owing to the success of the lead-off single and her collaboration with Foster and [[Diane Warren]], the album was as well received as ''Unison''. Other singles that achieved moderate success included "[[If You Asked Me To#C<U+00E9>line Dion version|If You Asked Me To]]" (a [[Cover version|cover]] of [[Patti LaBelle]]'s song from the 1989 movie ''[[Licence to Kill]]'') which peaked at number four on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100]], the gospel-tinged "[[Love Can Move Mountains]]," and "[[Nothing Broken but My Heart]]." As with Dion's earlier releases, the album had an overtone of love. 

By 1992, ''Unison'', ''C<U+00E9>line Dion'' and media appearances had propelled Dion to superstardom in the North America. She had achieved one of her main objectives: wedging her way into the anglophone market and achieving fame. Apart from her rising success, there were also changes in Dion's personal life, as Ang<U+00E9>lil made the transition from manager to lover. However, the relationship was kept a secret as they both feared that the public would find the twenty-six-year difference between their ages incongruous.

In 1993, Dion publicly indicated her feelings for her manager by declaring him "the colour of [her] love" in the dedication section of her third anglophone album ''[[The Colour of My Love]]''. However, instead of criticizing their relationship as Dion had feared, fans embraced the couple. Eventually, Ang<U+00E9>lil and Dion married in an extravagant wedding ceremony in December 1994. 

As it was dedicated to her manager, the album's motif focused on love and romance. The album spawned Dion's first U.S. number-one single "[[The Power of Love (Jennifer Rush song)#C<U+00E9>line Dion version|The Power of Love]]" (a remake of [[Jennifer Rush]]'s 1985 hit). However, subsequent singles such as "[[When I Fall in Love (song)#C<U+00E9>line Dion and Clive Griffin version|When I Fall in Love]]" (a [[duet]] with [[Clive Griffin]]), "[[Misled]]", and "[[Think Twice (Celine Dion song)|Think Twice]]" failed to reach the top twenty on the Billboard charts. The album proved more successful in Europe, and in particular the [[United Kingdom]], where both the album and "Think Twice" simultaneously occupied the top of the respective British charts for five consecutive weeks. "Think Twice," which remained at number one for seven weeks, went on to become the fourth single by a female artist to sell in excess of one million copies in the UK.<ref>{{cite web | title=Celinedion.com| work=The Journey so Far| url=http://www.celinedion.com/celinedion/english/journey3.html | accessdate=August 16| accessyear=2005}}</ref>

[[Image:NextPlaneOut.jpg|left|thumb|175px|The video for "[[Next Plane Out]]" depicts Dion and her lover on the beach in the sunset. It started a trend of typical and [[clich<U+00E9>]]d love ballads, lyrics and videos.]]

Dion kept to her French roots, and continued to release many Francophone recordings between each English record: ''[[Dion Chante Plamondon]]'' (1991); ''[[<U+00C0> l'Olympia]]'' (1994), a live album that was recorded during one of Dion's concerts at the Olympia Theatre in [[Paris]]; and ''[[D'eux]]'' (1995 <U+2014> also known as ''The French Album'' in the United States), which would go on to become the best-selling French album of all time. As these albums were in French, the worldwide commercial success was limited. However, Dion's Francophone fans embraced each release, and generally, they achieved more credibility than her anglophone works.

The mid-1990s was a transitional period for Dion's musical style, as she slowly moved away from strong rock influences and transitioned into a more pop and soul style (though the electric guitar remained a central part of her music.) Her songs began with more delicate melodies that used softer instrumentations, and built up to strong climaxes, over which her vocals could be displayed. This new sound received mixed reviews from critics, with Arion Berger of ''Entertainment Weekly'' accusing her of preferring vocal acrobatics over dynamics, and embarking on a trend of uninspiring, "crowd-pleasing ballads."<ref>{{cite web | title=Entertainment weekly| work=Celine Dion--Review | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/review/music/0,6115,310192_4_0_,00.html | accessdate=July 18| accessyear=2006}}</ref> Resultantly, she earned frequent comparisons to artists such as [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Mariah Carey]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Entertainment weekly| work=The Colour of My Love--Review | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/review/music/0,6115,308642_4_0_,00.html | accessdate=July 13| accessyear=2006}}</ref> There were also signs that her work was becoming more clich<U+00E9>d: critically, ''The Colour of My Love'' was not consistent with earlier works. However, while critical praise declined, Dion's releases performed increasingly well on the international charts, and in 1996, she won the World Music Award for "World<U+2019>s Best-Selling Canadian Female Recording Artist of the Year" <U+2014> a title she had earned twice before. By the mid-1990s, she had established herself as one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling artists in the world]], among female performers such as Carey and Houston.

''[[Falling into You]]'' ([[1996 in music|1996]]) presented Dion at the height of her popularity, and showed a further progression of her music. In an attempt to reach a wider audience, the album combined many elements (ornate [[orchestra|orchestral]] frills and African [[chanting]]), and instruments like the [[violin]], [[Classical guitar|Spanish guitar]], [[trombone]], the [[cavaquinho]], and [[saxophone]] created a new sound.<ref name= compel>{{cite web | title=Entertainment Weekly| work= Review --Falling into You| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/review/music/0,6115,291693_4_0_,00.html| accessdate=July 14|accessyear=2006}}</ref> The singles encompassed a variety of musical styles: the title track and "[[River Deep - Mountain High|River Deep, Mountain High]]" (a [[Tina Turner]] cover) made prominent use of [[percussion]] instruments; "[[It's All Coming Back to Me Now#C<U+00E9>line Dion version|It's All Coming Back to Me Now]]" (a remake of [[Jim Steinman]]'s song) and a remake of [[Eric Carmen]]'s "[[All by Myself#C<U+00E9>line Dion version|All by Myself]]" kept their soft-rock atmosphere, but were combined with the classical sound of the [[piano]]; and "[[Because You Loved Me]]," written by Diane Warren, was a maudlin ballad that served as the theme to the 1996 film ''[[Up Close & Personal]]''. The song spent two weeks at number one in Canada and six weeks at number one in the United States. 

''Falling into You'' was met with generally favorable reviews. While Dan Leroy wrote that it was not very different from her previous work,<ref>{{cite web | title=Yahoo Music| work= Review --Falling into You| url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/review/12030099| accessdate=November 1 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> and Stephen Holden of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and Elysa Gardner of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that the album was formulaic,<ref>Stephen, Holden.

Dion's status on the world stage was further solidified when she was asked to perform "[[The Power of the Dream]]" at the opening ceremonies of the 1996 [[Atlanta Olympic Games]]. In March 1996, C<U+00E9>line launched the [[Falling into You Tour]] in support of her new album, giving concerts around the world for over a year.

Dion followed ''Falling into You'' with ''[[Let's Talk About Love]]'' ([[1997 in music|1997]]), which she publicized as its sequel. The recording process took place in [[London]], [[New York City]], and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], and featured a host of special guests: [[Barbra Streisand]] on "[[Tell Him (1997 song)|Tell Him]];" the [[Bee Gees]] on "[[Immortality (Celine Dion song)|Immortality]];" and world-renowned [[tenor]] [[Luciano Pavarotti]] on "[[I Hate You Then I Love You]]." Other musicians included [[Carole King]], [[George Martin|Sir George Martin]], and [[Jamaica]]n singer [[Diana King]], who added a [[reggae]] tinge to "[[Treat Her Like a Lady]]." As the name suggests, the album had the same theme as Dion's preceding albums: "love." However, emphasis was also placed on "brotherly love" with "Where Is the Love" and "Let's Talk About Love". The most successful single from the album became the classically influenced ballad "[[My Heart Will Go On]]," which was composed by [[James Horner]], and produced by Horner and [[Walter Afanasieff]]. Serving as the love theme for the 1997 blockbuster film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', the song topped the charts in many countries across the world, and has become Dion's [[signature song]].  In support of her album, Dion embarked on the [[Let's Talk About Love Tour]] between 1998 and 1999, including shows with magician/comedian [[Jamie Porter]]. Comments were mostly favorable, but much focus was placed on her on-stage movements, which often consisted of chest-pounding, backward bending, and other flashy movements. While some people found these bombastic and even silly, others simply saw it as another extension of Dion's commanding stage presence.

Dion ended the 1990s with two more successful albums: the [[Christmas music|Christmas album]], ''[[These Are Special Times]]'' (1998), and ''[[All the Way... A Decade of Song]]'' (1999). On ''These Are Special Times'', Dion had a hand in writing some of the material. The album was her most classically influenced yet, with orchestral arrangements found on all tracks. "[[I'm Your Angel]]," a [[duet]] with [[R. Kelly]], became Dion's fourth and final U.S. number one single, and another hit single across the world. ''All the Way... A Decade of Song'' was a compilation of her most successful hits coupled with seven new songs, including the leadoff single "[[That's the Way It Is]]," a cover of [[Roberta Flack]]'s "[[The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face#C<U+00E9>line Dion version|The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face]]," and "[[All the Way (song)|All the Way]]," a duet with [[Frank Sinatra]].

[[Image:Myheartwillgoon.jpg|right|thumb|275px|"My Heart Will Go On" became one of the decade's biggest hits, winning four Grammy awards including Record and Song of the Year. {{audio| MyHeartWillGoOnSample.ogg|Audio sample}}]]

By the end of the 1990s Celine Dion had sold nearly 140 million albums worldwide, and had won a slew of industry awards. Her status as one of the biggest divas of contemporary music was further solidified when she was asked to perform on [[VH1]]'s ''Divas Live'' special in 1998, with superstars [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Gloria Estefan]], [[Shania Twain]], and [[Mariah Carey]]. That year she also received two of the highest honors from her home country: "Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] for Outstanding Contribution to the World of Contemporary Music" and "Officer of the [[National Order of Quebec]]." A year later she was inducted into the [[Canadian Broadcast Hall of Fame]], and was honoured with a star on [[Canada's Walk of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web | title= canadaswalkoffame.com|work =Canada's Walk of Fame|url= http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/|accessdate=October 30|accessyear=2006}}</ref> She also won the Grammy awards for "[[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]" and the most coveted "[[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]]" for "[[My Heart Will Go On]]" (the song won four awards, but two were presented to the songwriters).
 
Compared to her debut, both the quality and sound of Dion's music had also changed significantly. The soft-rock influences on her earlier releases were no longer prominent; they were replaced by more soul/adult contemporary styles. However, the theme of "love" remained in all her releases, and this led to many critics dismissing her work as banal. <ref>{{cite web | title= findarticles.com|work =The unsinkable Celine Dion - French-Canadian singer - Interview|url= http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1285/is_3_29/ai_54133689|accessdate=December 05| accessyear=2005}}</ref> In a scathing review of ''Let's Talk About Love'', Rob O'Connor wrote:

Dion was also criticized for some of her remakes and duets: "[[The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face#C<U+00E9>line Dion version|The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face]]" and "[[All the Way (song)|All the Way]]" were described as disastrous and "creepy" by Allison Stewart of ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' and Erlwine of ''All Music Guide''.<ref>Stewart, Allison.

''Review: These Are Special Times''. ''[[The Atlanta Constitution]]''. Atlanta, Ga.: [[November 3]], [[1998]]. pg. C.01)</ref>

===2000<U+2013>2002: Career break===
After releasing and promoting thirteen albums during the 1990s, Dion felt that she needed to settle down, and announced on her final album, ''[[All the Way... A Decade of Song]]'', that she had experienced many things and needed to take a step back and enjoy life. Ang<U+00E9>lil's diagnosis with [[throat cancer]] also prompted her to retire. After undergoing fertility treatments, she gave birth to a son, [[Ren<U+00E9>-Charles Dion Ang<U+00E9>lil]], on January 25, 2001.

While on break, Dion was unable to escape the spotlight. In late 2002, the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' published a false story about the singer. Brandishing a picture of Dion and her husband, the magazine misquoted Dion, printing the headline: "Celine <U+2014> 'I'm Pregnant With Twins!'" Dion later sued the magazine for over twenty million dollars. The editors of the ''Enquirer'' printed an apology and a full retraction to Dion in the next issue, and donated money to the [[American Cancer Society]] in honor of Dion and her husband. 

Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], Dion returned to the music scene and in a televised performance sang "[[God Bless America#C<U+00E9>line Dion version (following 9/11 terrorist attacks)|God Bless America]]" at the benefit concert [[America: A Tribute to Heroes]]. Chuck Taylor of ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'' wrote that "the performance... brings to mind what has made her one of the celebrated vocalists of our time: the ability to render emotion that shakes the soul. Affecting, meaningful, and filled with grace, this is a musical reflection to share with all of us still searching for ways to cope."<ref>Taylor, Chuck.

Dion's aptly titled ''[[A New Day Has Come]]'', released in March 2002, ended her two-year break from the music industry. The theme of the album was "new beginnings," and even though it did not incorporate many genres, a few dance-pop tunes ("[[I'm Alive (Celine Dion song)|I'm Alive]]" and "Sorry for Love") could be found among a throng of adult contemporary tracks. [[Shania Twain]] and [[Chantal Kreviazuk]] also appeared on the album and sang [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]]. The album established a more mature side of Dion with the songs "[[A New Day Has Come (song)|A New Day Has Come]]," "[[Nature Boy]]" and "[[Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)]]." This change was as a result of her new-found maternal responsibilities, because, in her own words, "becoming a mother makes you a grown-up."<ref>{{cite web| title=VH1 | work= Celine Dion: Let's Talk About Success: The Singer Explains Her Career High-Points| url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1453531/04222002/dion_celine.jhtml| accessdate= December 19| accessyear= 2005}}</ref> ''A New Day Has Come'' restarted her commercial success as it topped the charts in seventeen countries. The album featured the title track, "A New Day Has Come," and a cover of [[Etta James]]'s "[[At Last]]." A [[CBS]] television concert helped to promote the album, during which Dion performed with [[Destiny's Child]] and [[Brian McKnight]]. While the album achieved success, critical comments suggested that it was "forgettable" and the lyrics were "lifeless." Rob Sheffield of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine wrote that Dion's music had not matured and that she still suffered from mediocre vocal talent.<ref>{{cite web | title=Rolling Stone|work=Review--A New Day has come| url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/_/id/175170/celinedion?pageid=rs.ArtistDiscographyMainReleases&pageregion=mainRegion | accessdate=November 1| accessyear=2005}}</ref> Sal Cinquemani of ''[[Slant Magazine|Slant]]'' magazine called the album "a lengthy collection of drippy, gooey pop fluffer-nutter."<ref>{{cite web | title=Slant Magazine | work=Review--A New Day Has Come| url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=59 | accessdate= July 18| accessyear=2006}}</ref>

[[Image:ImageOHcap5.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The upbeat tempo of "[[One Heart (song)|One Heart]]" and the bright colours and "party" style of the music video were a new direction to Celine Dion's work.]]
Drawing inspiration from personal experiences, Dion released ''[[One Heart]]'' (2003), an album that encapsulated her appreciation for the joys of life.<ref>Flick, Larry. ''One Heart''. [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' magazine. New York: [[March 29]], [[2003]]. Vol.115, Iss. 13;  pg. 30, 1 pgs</ref> The album largely consisted of dance music <U+2014> a deviation from the soaring, melodramatic ballads, for which she had once been given mixed reception. Although it achieved moderate success, ''One Heart'' hinted that Dion was unable to overcome the creative wall that she had hit, and words such as "predictable" and "banal" appeared even in the most lenient reviews.<ref>{{cite web | title=All Music Guide | work=Review--One Heart| url= http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:30dovwnqa9ek| accessdate=July 17| accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref>Durchholz, Daniel. ''One Heart:Celine's a Diva Who Still Goes On and On''. ''St.Louis Post'' - Dispatch. St. Louis, Mo.: Apr 24, 2003. pg. F.3</ref>  A cover of [[Roy Orbison]]'s "[[I Drove All Night#C<U+00E9>line Dion version|I Drove All Night]]," released to launch her new advertising campaign with [[Chrysler]], incorporated dance-pop and rock and roll and was called reminiscent of [[Cher]]'s 1980s work, but it was dismissed as Dion trying to please her sponsors.<ref>Murray, Sonia. ''Celine Dion's latest takes easy, well-worn route''. The Atlanta Journal<U+2013>Constitution. Atlanta, Georgia: [[March 25]], [[2003]]. pg. C.1.</ref> 

By the mid 2000s Dion's music had changed to the point where her releases possessed maternal overtones: ''[[Miracle (Celine Dion album)|Miracle]]'' (2004), a multimedia project conceived by Dion and photographer [[Anne Geddes]], had a theme centering on babies and motherhood. The album was saturated with lullabies and other songs of maternal love and inspiration, the two most popular being covers of [[Louis Armstrong]]'s "[[What a Wonderful World]]" and [[John Lennon]]'s "[[Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)#C<U+00E9>line Dion version|Beautiful Boy]]." The reviews for ''Miracle'' were generally weak: while [[Charles Taylor]] of ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'' magazine wrote that the single "Beautiful Boy" was "an unexpected gem" and called Dion "a timeless, enormously versatile artist,"<ref>Taylor, Chuck. ''Celine Dion: "Beautiful Boy"''. ''Billboard''. New York: Oct 16, 2004.Vol.116, Iss. 42; pg. 33, 1 pgs</ref> Nancy Miller of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote: "the whole earth-mama act is just opportunism."<ref>{{cite web | title=Entertainment Weekly | work=Review: Miracle| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/review/music/0,6115,724253_4_0_,00.html| accessdate= November 30| accessyear= 2005}}</ref> 

[[Image:CelineDion-1Fille&4Types.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The cover and music of ''[[1 Fille & 4 Types]]'' presents Dion in one of her most relaxed states.]]

The Francophone album ''[[1 Fille & 4 Types]]'' (''One Girl and Four Guys'', [[2003 in music|2003]]), fared better than her first two comebacks, and showed Dion trying to distance herself from the "diva" image. She recruited [[Jean-Jacques Goldman]], Gildas Arzel, Eric Benzi, and Jacques Veneruso, with whom she had previously worked on ''[[S'il Suffisait d'Aimer]]'' and ''[[D'eux]]'' to help. The album's musical theme was fun and relaxation, and Dion herself has referred to it as "the album of pleasure." The cover showed Dion in a simple and relaxed manner, a contrast to the choreographed poses usually found on her album covers. The album achieved relative critical success: reviewer Stephen Erlwine of "All Music Guide" wrote that Dion was "getting back to pop basics and performing at a level unheard in a while."<ref>{{cite web | title= All Music Guide| work=Review--1 Fille & 4 Types|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:5uhqoatawijz|accessdate=November 20|accessyear= 2005}}</ref> 

Though her albums were relatively successful, signs of a decline began to appear in the poorer critical reception of ''[[The Collector's Series Volume One]]'' (2000), ''A New Day Has Come'' (2002), and ''One Heart'' (2003). The mass appeal of Dion's later works had declined due to the nature of the themes. Her songs received less airplay as radio became less embracing of balladeers like Dion, Carey and Houston, and now focused on more up-tempo, [[R&B]]/[[Hip hop music|Hip-hop]] songs.<ref>Gardner, Elysa. [http://www.usatoday.com/life/dcovfri.htm Mariah Carey, 'standing again']. ''[[USA Today]]''. November 28, 2002. Retrieved August 19, 2005.</ref> However, by 2005 Dion had accumulated sales of over 175 million records, and received the Chopard Diamond World Music award for becoming the best-selling female artist in the world.

===2003<U+2013>present: ''A New Day... Live in Las Vegas''===
[[Image:2004and080.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Dion performing "[[I'm Alive (Celine Dion song)|I'm Alive]]" during her show ''[[A New Day...]]'' in Las Vegas.]]
In early 2002, Dion announced a three-year, 600-show contract to appear five nights a week in an entertainment extravaganza, ''[[A New Day...]]'', at [[Caesars Palace]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. This move was seen as "one of the smartest business decisions in years by any major recording artist" given the poor performance of her current releases.<ref>Di Nunzio, Miriam. ''<nowiki>'A New Day'</nowiki>: Vegas gamble pays off for Celine Dion"''. Chicago Sun-Times,  Mar 20, 2005.</ref>

She conceived the idea for the show after seeing ''[[O (Cirque du Soleil)|O]]'' by Dragone early in her break from recording, and began on [[March 25]] [[2003]], in a 4000-seat arena designed for her show. The show, put together by [[Franco Dragone]], is a combination of dance, music, and visual effects. It includes Dion performing her biggest hits against an array of dancers and special effects.

Reviewer Mike Weatherford felt that, at first, Dion was not as relaxed as she should be, and at times, it was hard to find the singer among the excessive stage ornamentations and dancers. However, he noted that the show has become more enjoyable, due to Dion's improved stage-presence and simpler costumes.<ref>{{cite journal | author= Weatherford, Mike| title= Show review: As Dion feels more comfortable, her show improves| journal= Reviewjournal.com | year= 2004| url= http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Oct-01-Fri-2004/weekly/24865136.html}}</ref> 
The show has also been well-received by audiences, despite the complaints of expensive tickets; the show has sold out almost every night since its 2003 opening. According to ''[[Pollstar]]'', Dion had sold 322,000 tickets and grossed $43.9 million in the first half of 2005, and by July 2005, she had sold out 315 out of 384 shows.<ref>{{cite news | title= Dion extends long Las Vegas stint| date=Sunday, [[19 September]] [[2004]] | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3670760.stm}}</ref>
By the end of 2005, Dion grossed over $76 million, placing sixth on ''Billboard's Money Makers list for 2005''.<ref>{{cite web | title=Billboard.com | work= U2 Tops Billboard's Money Makers Chart| url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001882362| accessdate= January 25| accessyear= 2006}}</ref> Because of the show's success, Dion's contract was extended into [[2007]] for an undisclosed sum. On [[January 5]], [[2007]] it was announced that the show would be ending in December [[2007]], with ticket for the period after October [[2007]] going on sale from [[March 1]]<ref>{{cite web | title=BBC | work= Celine Dion is leaving Las Vegas |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6233473.stm | accessdate= January 5 | accessyear= 2007}}</ref> 

In 2005, Dion released her first comprehensive greatest hits album in French, ''[[On Ne Change Pas (album)|On Ne Change Pas]]'', which features three new songs, including a duet with [[Il Divo]] called "[[I Believe in You (Je Crois en Toi)|I Believe in You]]". ''A New Day...'' was the 6th biggest selling tour in America in 2006. <ref>{{cite web | title=You Tube| work= Celine Dion| url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=eaAi8V3k8YE| accessdate= October 20| accessyear= 2006}}</ref>

In February 2007, Dion made her latest contribution to a tribute album, the song "I Knew I Loved You" (based on a theme from ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]''), the centerpiece track on the CD ''[[We All Love Ennio Morricone]]''.  She went on to perform this song at the [[2007 Academy Awards]] to honor [[Ennio Morricone]].

Dion's next French language album ''[[D'Elles]]'' is scheduled to be released on [[May 21]] [[2007]] in selected European countries and in Brazil. It will be released in Canada the following day. The first single "[[S'il N'en Restait Qu'une (Je Serais Celle-l<U+00E0>)]]" premiered on the radio in Francophone countries on [[February 14]] [[2007]].<ref>{{cite web| title= What's Goin' On| work= D'elles Release Dates Info|url=http://www.celinedion.com/celinedion/english/whatsgoinon.cgi|accessdate=February 10|accessyear= 2007}}</ref>

Dion is one of pop music's most respected singers, and her vocal talents and expansive, [[coloratura soprano]] vocal range<ref>{{cite book | last = Martin | first = Bill | coauthors =  | title = Pro Secrets Of Heavy Rock Singing | publisher = Sanctuary Publishing | date = 2002 | pages = Page 9 | month = | id = ISBN 1-86074-437-0}}</ref> has influenced the singing styles of others such as [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Christina Aguilera]]. In [[MTV]]'s "[[22 Greatest Voices in Music]]" countdown, she placed ninth (sixth for a female), and she was also placed fourth in ''Cove Magazine''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> list of "The 100 Outstanding Pop Vocalists."<ref name=cove>{{cite web | title=Cove Magazine| work= The 100 Outstanding Pop Vocalists| url=http://covemagazine.com/100vocalists.html| accessdate=August 29|accessyear=2006}}</ref> In ''[[MuchMoreMusic]]''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> "Top 20 Divine Divas" program Dion ranked at number three, behind [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Mariah Carey]]. They also described her voice as "one of the most powerful vocal workouts ever to be recorded."<ref>"Top 20 Divine Divas" ''[[MuchMoreMusic]]''. 2006. Accessed June 15, 2006.</ref>

While industry officials note her for her vocal talents, Dion is often the subject of media ridicule, and is frequently impersonated on shows like ''[[MADtv]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[South Park]]'' for her Quebecois accent, as well as her conservative nature and on-stage movements. She is also heavily mocked in her home country of Canada on popular shows ''Royal Canadian Air Farce'' and ''This Hour Has 22 Minutes''. However, Dion seems unabashed by media ridicule: "I'm flattered when they take the time to impersonate you," she says. "I think it's a good sign."<ref>Op cit. ''Celine Dion: Let's Talk About Success: The Singer Explains Her Career High-Points.</ref> She even invited [[Ana Gasteyer]], who parodied her on SNL, to appear on stage during one of her performances.

Dion is rarely the center of media controversies. However, in 2005, following the [[Hurricane Katrina]] disaster, she appeared on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' and tearfully criticized [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] regarding the [[Iraq War]] and his slow response in aiding the victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]]: "How come it's so easy to send planes in another country, to kill everyone in a second, to destroy lives? We need to be there right now to rescue the rest of the people."<ref>{{cite web | title=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation| work= Celine Dion takes swipe at Iraq war; donates $1m to Katrina victims| url=http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2005/09/04/Arts/celine_dion_iraq20050904.html| accessdate=July 14|accessyear=2006}}</ref> She later claimed, "When I do interviews with [[Larry King]] or the big TV shows like that, they put you on the spot, which is very difficult. I do have an opinion, but I'm a singer. I'm not a politician."<ref>{{cite book | author=Glatzer, Jenna| title=Celine Dion: For Keeps | publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing| year=2005 | id=ISBN 0-7407-5559-5}}</ref>

==Other activities==
Dion became an [[entrepreneur]] with the establishment of her [[Franchising|franchise]] [[restaurant]] [[Nickels Grill & Bar|"Nickels"]] in 1990. She has since divested her interests in the chain and was no longer affiliated with ''Nickels'' as of 1997. She also has a range of eyewear and a line of perfume, manufactured by [[Coty, Inc.]]. In October 2004, Canada's national air carrier [[Air Canada]] hired Dion as part of the new promotional campaign as the airline unveiled new in-flight service products and new aircraft livery. "[[You and I (Celine Dion song)|You and I]]," the theme song sung by Dion, was written by an advertising executive working for Air Canada. 

Dion has actively supported many charity organizations worldwide. She has promoted the [[Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation]] (CCFF) since 1982 and became the foundation's National Celebrity Patron in 1993. She has an emotional attachment to the foundation; her niece Karine succumbed to the disease at the age of sixteen. In 2003, Dion joined a number of other celebrities, athletes and politicians including Josh Groban and Yolanda Adams to support "World Children's Day", a global fundraising effort sponsored by [[McDonald's]]. The effort raised money from over 100 countries and benefited many orphanages and children's health organizations. Dion has also been a major supporter of the T.J. Martell Foundation, the [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana Princess Of Wales]] Memorial Fund, and many health and education campaigns.

Dion has donated proceeds from selected performances of her Las Vegas show to various charitable causes.
