The '''durian''' ({{IPA2|d<U+032A>u<U+02C8><U+027E>i.<U+0251>n}}) is the [[fruit]] of trees of the [[genus]] ''Durio'' belonging to the [[Malvaceae]], a large family which includes [[hibiscus]], [[okra]], [[cotton]], [[mallows]] and [[Tilia|linden]] trees. Widely known and revered in [[Southeast Asia]] as the "King of Fruits,"<ref name=Heaton/> the fruit is distinctive for its large size, unique [[odor|odour]], and a formidable thorn-covered [[husk]]. Its name comes from the [[Malay language|Malay]] word ''duri'' (thorn) together with Malay [[suffix]] that is -''an'' (for building a noun in Malay), meaning "thorny fruit."<ref>{{cite book | quote=Via ''durion'', the Malay name for the plant. | title = [[Oxford English Dictionary]] | year = 1897 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Huxley, A.

[[Image:Durian plant.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A ''Durio zibethinus'' plant, eight months old]] 
Durian [[tree]]s are relatively large, growing up to 25&ndash;50&nbsp;metres (80&ndash;165 ft) in height, depending on species. The leaves are [[evergreen]], opposite, elliptic to oblong and 10&ndash;18&nbsp;centimetres (4&ndash;7 in) long. The flowers are produced in three to thirty clusters together on large branches and the trunk, each flower having a calyx ([[sepals]]) and 5 (rarely 4 or 6) [[petal]]s. Durian trees have one or two flowering and fruiting periods each year, although the timing of these varies depending on species, cultivars and localities. A typical durian tree can bear fruit after four or five years. The durian fruit, which can hang from any branch, matures in about three months after [[pollination]]. Among the thirty known species of ''Durio'', so far nine species have been identified to produce edible fruits: ''D. zibethinus'', ''D. dulcis'', ''D. grandiflorus'', ''D. graveolens'', ''[[Durio kutejensis|D. kutejensis]]'', ''D. lowianus'', ''D. macrantha'', ''D. oxleyanus'' and ''D. testudinarum''. However, there are many species for which the fruit has never been collected or properly examined, and other species with edible fruit may exist.<ref name=Brown>{{cite book | author=Brown, Michael J. | title=Durio &mdash; A Bibliographic Review | publisher=International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) | year=1997 | url = http://www.bioversityinternational.org/publications/Pdf/654.pdf | format = PDF | isbn=92-9043-318-3 | accessdate = 2007-03-14}}</ref>

[[Image:Wilddurian.jpg|thumb|right|''Durio graveolens'', also known as red-fleshed durian. The colour of its flesh ranges from orange to bright red.]]
''D. zibethinus'' is the only species commercially cultivated on a large scale and available outside of its native region. Since this species is open-pollinated, it shows considerable diversity in fruit colour and odour, size of flesh and seed, and tree [[phenology]]. In the species name, ''zibethinus'' refers to the Indian [[civet]], ''Viverra zibetha''. There is disagreement regarding whether this name, bestowed by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], refers to civets being so fond of the durian that the fruit was used as bait to entrap them, or to the durian smelling like the civet.<ref>{{cite book | author = Brown, Michael J. | title=Durio &mdash; A Bibliographic Review | publisher = International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI)| year=1997 | url = http://www.bioversityinternational.org/publications/Pdf/654.pdf | isbn=92-9043-318-3 | pages = p. 2; also, see pp. 5&ndash;6 regarding whether Linnaeus or Murray is the correct authority for the [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial name]] | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-03-14}}</ref>

Durian flowers are large and feathery with copious [[nectar (plant)|nectar]], and give off a heavy, sour and buttery odour. These features are typical of flowers which are pollinated by certain species of [[bat]]s while they eat nectar and [[pollen]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Whitten, Tony | title=The Ecology of Sumatra | publisher=Periplus | year=2001 | id=ISBN 962-593-074-4 | pages=p. 329}}</ref> According to a research conducted in Malaysia during 1970s, durians were pollinated almost exclusively by cave fruit bats (''[[Eonycteris|Eonycteris spelaea]]'').<ref name=Brown/> However, a more recent research done in 1996 indicated that two species, ''D. grandiflorus'' and ''D. oblongus'', were pollinated by [[spiderhunter]]s ([[Nectariniidae]]) and that the other species, ''D. kutejensis'', was pollinated by giant honey bees and birds as well as bats.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Bird-pollination of Three Durio Species (Bombacaceae) in a Tropical Rainforest in Sarawak, Malaysia | author = Yumoto, Takakazu | journal = [[American Journal of Botany]] | volume = 87 | issue = 8 |pages = p. 1181<U+2013>1188 | year = 2000 }}</ref>

===Cultivars===
[[Image:Durian Pulp 2a.JPG|thumb|left|A cultivar of ''Durio zibethinus'', Mao Shan Wang, also known as Mountain Cat King, from Malaysia]]

Numerous [[cultivar]]s (also called "clones") of durian have arisen in southeastern Asia over the centuries. They used to be grown from seeds with superior quality, but are now propagated by layering, marcotting, or more commonly, by [[grafting]], including bud, [[Wood veneer|veneer]], wedge, whip or U-grafting onto seedlings of random [[rootstock]]s. Different cultivars can be distinguished to some extent by variations in the fruit shape, such as the shape of the spines.<ref name=Brown/> Durian consumers do express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher prices in the market.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~durian/info/vk_duri.htm | title = Comprehensive List of Durian Clones Registered by the Agriculture Department (of Malaysia)| publisher = Durian OnLine | accessdate= 2006-03-05}}</ref>

Most cultivars have both a common name and also a code number starting with "D". For example, some popular clones are Kop (D99), Chanee (D123), Tuan Mek Hijau (D145), Kan Yao (D158), Mon Thong (D159), Kradum Thong, and with no common name, D24. Each cultivar has a distinct taste and odour. More than 200 cultivars of ''D. zibethinus'' exist in [[Thailand]], Chanee being the most preferred rootstock due to its resistance to infection by ''[[Phytophthora palmivora]]''. Among all the cultivars in Thailand, though, only four see large scale commercial cultivation: Chanee, Kradum Thong, Mon Thong, and Kan Yao. There are more than 100 registered cultivars in [[Malaysia]] and many superior cultivars have been identified through competitions held at the annual Malaysian Agriculture, Horticulture and Agrotourism Show. In [[Vietnam]], the same process has been done through competitions held by the Southern Fruit Research Institute.

In recent times, Songpol Somsri, a Thai government scientist, crossbred more than ninety varieties of durian to create Chantaburi No. 1, a cultivar without the characteristic odour, which is awaiting final approval from the local Ministry of Agriculture.<ref name="Fuller">{{cite web | author=Fuller, Thomas | date = [[2007-04-08]] | title = Fans Sour on Sweeter Version of Asia's Smelliest Fruit | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/08/world/asia/08durian.html?ex=1333684800&en=bc818fd0f3339f36&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss | work =[[New York Times]] | accessdate= 2007-04-08}}</ref> Another hybrid he created, named Chantaburi No. 3, develops the odour about three days after the fruit is picked, which enables an odourless transport and satisfies consumers who prefer the pungent odour.<ref name="Fuller"/>

==Cultivation and availability==
[[Image:Durian stall.JPG|thumb|right|A durian stall in [[Singapore]]]]
The durian is native to [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Brunei]]. There is some debate as to whether the durian is native to the [[Philippines]], or has been introduced.<ref name=Brown/> The durian is grown in areas with a similar climate; it is strictly [[Tropical agriculture|tropical]] and stops growing when mean daily temperatures drop below 22 <U+00B0>C (71 <U+00B0>F).<ref name=ACIAR/> 

The centre of [[ecology|ecological]] diversity for durians is the island of [[Borneo]], where the fruit of the edible species of ''Durio'' including ''D. zibethinus'', ''D. dulcis'', ''D. graveolens'', ''D. kutejensis'', ''D. oxleyanus'' and ''D. testudinarium'' are sold in local markets. In Brunei, ''D. zibethinus'' is not grown because consumers prefer other species such as ''D. graveolens'', ''D. kutejensis'' and ''D. oxyleyanus''. These species are commonly distributed in Brunei and together with other species like ''D. testudinarium'' and ''D. dulcis'', represent rich [[genetic diversity]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ipgri.cgiar.org/Publications/HTMLPublications/655/ch08.htm | title = Tropical fruit production and genetic resources in Southeast Asia: Identifying the priority fruit species | author = M.B.

[[Image:Durianpack01.JPG|thumb|left|Durian flesh packed for sale, with an exposed seed]]
Although the durian is not native to [[Thailand]], the country is currently one of the major exporters of durians, growing 781,000 [[tonnes]] (860,000 [[short ton|S/T]]) of the world's total harvest of 1,400,000&nbsp;tonnes (1,540,000 S/T) in 1999, exporting 111,000&nbsp;tonnes (122,000 S/T).<ref name=trade/> Malaysia and Indonesia followed, both producing about 265,000&nbsp;tonnes (292,000 S/T) each. Malaysia exported 35,000&nbsp;tonnes (38,600 S/T) in 1999.<ref name=trade/> In the Philippines, the centre of durian production is the [[Davao Region]]. The Kadayawan festival is an annual celebration featuring the durian in [[Davao City]]. Other places where durians are grown include [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]], [[Myanmar]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[West Indies]], [[Florida]], [[Hawaii]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Polynesia|Polynesian Islands]], [[Madagascar]], southern China (Hainan Island), [[northern Australia]], and Pulau Ubin island in [[Singapore]]. 

Durian was introduced into Australia in the early 1960s and clonal material was first introduced in 1975. Over thirty clones of ''D. zibethinus'' and six ''Durio'' species have been subsequently introduced into Australia.<ref>{{ cite journal | author = Watson, B.

The durian is a seasonal fruit, unlike some other non-seasonal tropical fruits such as the [[papaya]] which are available throughout the year. In Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore, the season for durians is typically from June to August, which coincides with that of the [[mangosteen]].<ref name=Brown/> Prices of durians are relatively high as compared with other fruits. For example, in Singapore, the strong demand for high quality cultivars such as the D24, ''Sultan'', and ''Mao Shan Wang'' has resulted in typical retail prices of between [[S$]]8 to S$15 ([[US$]]5 to US$10) per kilogram of whole fruit.<ref name=ST>{{cite web | url = http://www.stomp.com.sg/stfoodiesclub/taste/03/index.html | title = ST Foodies Club - Durian King | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2007-07-25 | publisher = [[The Straits Times]] }}</ref> With an average weight of about 1.5 kilograms, a durian fruit would therefore set the consumer back by about S$12 to S$22 (US$8 to US$15).<ref name=ST/> The edible portion of the fruit, known as the [[aril]] (usually referred to as the "flesh" or "pulp") only accounts for about 15-30% of the mass of the entire fruit.<ref name=Brown>{{cite book | author=Brown, Michael J. | title=Durio &mdash; A Bibliographic Review | publisher=International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI), at p35 | year=1997 | url = http://www.bioversityinternational.org/publications/Pdf/654.pdf | format = PDF | isbn=92-9043-318-3 | accessdate = 2007-03-14}}</ref> Many consumers in Singapore are nevertheless quite willing to spend up to around S$75 (US$50) in a single purchase of about half a dozen of the favoured fruit to be shared by family members.<ref name=ST/>

In season durians can be found in mainstream [[Japan]]ese supermarkets while, in the West, they are sold mainly by Asian markets.

==Flavour and odour==
[[Image:Singapore MRT Fines.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Sign forbidding durians on Singapore's [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Mass Rapid Transit]]]]

The unusual flavour and odour of the fruit have prompted many people to search for an accurate description, with widely divergent and passionate views expressed, ranging from highly appreciative to deep disgust.

Writing in 1856, the British [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] provides a much-quoted description of the flavour of the durian: 

{{cquote| The five cells are silky-white within, and are filled with a mass of firm, cream-coloured pulp, containing about three seeds each. This pulp is the eatable part, and its consistence and flavour are indescribable. A rich custard highly flavoured with almonds gives the best general idea of it, but there are occasional wafts of flavour that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine, and other incongruous dishes. Then there is a rich glutinous smoothness in the pulp which nothing else possesses, but which adds to its delicacy. It is neither acid nor sweet nor juicy; yet it wants neither of these qualities, for it is in itself perfect. It produces no nausea or other bad effect, and the more you eat of it the less you feel inclined to stop. In fact, to eat Durians is a new sensation worth a voyage to the East to experience. ... as producing a food of the most exquisite flavour it is unsurpassed.<ref name=Wallace>{{cite web | author = [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Wallace, Alfred Russel]] | title = On the Bamboo and Durian of Borneo | date = 1856 | url = http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S027.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-12}}</ref>}}

Wallace cautions that "the smell of the ripe fruit is certainly at first disagreeable"; more recent descriptions by westerners can be more graphic. It can be smelled from yards away.  Despite its great local popularity, the raw fruit is forbidden from some establishments such as hotels, subways and airports, including public transportation in Southeast Asia.<ref>{{cite book | author=Winokur, Jon (Ed.) | title=The Traveling Curmudgeon: Irreverent Notes, Quotes, and Anecdotes on Dismal Destinations, Excess Baggage, the Full Upright Position, and Other Reasons Not to Go There | publisher=Sasquatch Books | year=2003 | id=ISBN 1-57061-389-3 | pages = p. 102}}</ref>}} [[Image:Thiol-group.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Thiol]], one of the [[organosulfur compounds]] that may be responsible for the characteristic odour of durian]]
Other comparisons have been made with the [[civet]], [[sewage]], stale vomit, [[Skunk|skunk spray]], and used surgical swabs.<ref name=Davidson>{{cite book | author=[[Alan Davidson (food writer)|Davidson, Alan]] | title= [[The Oxford Companion to Food]] | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year=1999 | id=ISBN 0-19-211579-0 | pages= p. 263}}</ref> 
The wide range of descriptions for the odour of durian may have a great deal to do with the wide variability of durian odour itself. Durians from different species or clones can have significantly different aromas; for example, red durian (''D. dulcis'') has a deep [[caramel]] flavour with a [[turpentine]] odour, while red-fleshed durian (''D. graveolens'') emits a fragrance of roasted [[almond]]s.<ref name=ACIAR2>{{cite web | url = http://www.aciar.gov.au/web.nsf/att/JFRN-6BN9E4/$file/mn114-part3.pdf | title = 8.2 Occurrence, Distribution and Utilisation of Durian Germplasm | year = 2004 | accessdate = 2007-03-13 | format = PDF |author = O'Gara, E., Guest, D. I. and Hassan, N. M. | publisher = Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) }}</ref> The degree of ripeness has a great effect on the flavour as well.<ref name=Brown/> Three scientific analyses of the composition of durian aroma &mdash; from 1972, 1980, and 1995 &mdash; each found a different mix of volatile compounds, including [[ester]]s, [[ketone]]s and many different [[organosulfur compounds]], with no agreement on which may be primarily responsible for the distinctive odour.<ref name=Brown/> 

This strong odour can be detected half a mile away by animals, thus luring them. In addition, the fruit is extremely appetising to a variety of animals, from [[squirrel]]s to [[Chevrotain|mouse deer]], [[pig]]s, [[orangutan]], [[elephant]]s, and even carnivorous [[tiger]]s. While some of these animals eat the fruit and dispose of the seed under the parent plant, others swallow the seed with the fruit and then transport it some distance before excreting, with the seed being dispersed as the result.<ref>{{cite book | author=Marinelli, Janet (Ed.) | title=Brooklyn Botanic Garden Gardener's Desk Reference | publisher=Henry Holt and Co. | year=1998 | id=ISBN 0-8050-5095-7 | pages = p. 691 }}</ref> The thorny armored covering of the fruit may have evolved because it discourages smaller animals, since larger animals are more likely to transport the seeds far from the parent tree.<ref name=McGee>{{cite book | author = [[Harold McGee|McGee, Harold]] | title= On Food and Cooking (Revised Edition) | publisher=Scribner | year=2004 | id=ISBN 0-684-80001-2 | pages = p. 379}}</ref>

===Ripeness and selection===

According to ''[[Larousse Gastronomique]]'', the durian fruit is ready to eat when its husk begins to crack.<ref>{{cite book | title = [[Larousse Gastronomique]] | author = Montagne, Prosper (Ed.) | publisher = Clarkson Potter | year = 2001 | isbn = 0609609718 | pages = p. 439}}</ref> However, the ideal stage of ripeness to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast Asia and also by species.  Some species grow so tall, they can only be collected once they have fallen to the ground, whereas most cultivars of ''D. zibethinus'' (such as Mon Thong) are nearly always cut from the tree and allowed to ripen while waiting to be sold. Some people in [[southern Thailand]] prefer their durians relatively young, when the clusters of fruit within the shell are still crisp in texture and mild in flavour. In [[northern Thailand]], the preference is for the fruit to be as soft and pungent in aroma as possible. In Malaysia and Singapore, most consumers also prefer the fruit to be quite ripe and may even risk allowing the fruit to continue ripening after its husk has already cracked open on its own. In this state, the flesh becomes richly creamy, slightly alcoholic,<ref name=Davidson/> the aroma pronounced and the flavour highly complex.

The differing preferences regarding ripeness among different consumers makes it hard to issue general statements about choosing a "good" durian. A durian that falls off the tree continues to ripen for two to four days, but after five or six days most would consider it overripe and unpalatable.<ref name=Morton>{{cite book | author=Morton, J. F. | url = http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/durian_ars.html | title=Fruits of Warm Climates | publisher=Florida Flair Books | year=1987 | id=ISBN 0-9610184-1-0}}</ref> The usual advice for a durian consumer choosing a whole fruit in the market is to examine the quality of the [[plant stem|stem]] or stalk, which loses moisture as it ages: a big, solid stem is a sign of freshness.<ref name=tech>{{cite web | url = http://www.proscitech.com.au/trop/d.htm | title = Durian & Mangosteens | publisher = Prositech.com | accessdate = 2006-07-01 }}</ref> Reportedly, unscrupulous merchants wrap, paint, or remove the stalks altogether. Another frequent piece of advice is to shake the fruit and listen for the sound of the seeds moving within, indicating that the durian is very ripe, and the pulp has dried out somewhat.<ref name=tech/>

==History==
[[Image:Durio Zibethinus Van Nooten.jpg|thumb|upright|right|''Durio zibethinus''. [[Chromolithograph]] by Hoola Van Nooten, circa 1863]]
The durian has been known and consumed in southeastern Asia since [[Prehistory|prehistoric times]], but has only been known to the western world for about 600 years. The earliest known European reference on the durian is the record of Nicolo Conti who travelled to southeastern Asia in 15th century.<ref name=Brown/> [[Garcia de Orta]] described durians in ''[[Col<U+00F3>quios dos Simples e Drogas da India]]'' published in 1563. In 1741, ''Herbarium Amboinense'' by the German botanist [[Georg Eberhard Rumphius]] was published, providing the most detailed and accurate account of durians for over a century. The genus ''Durio'' has a complex [[taxonomy]] that has seen the subtraction and addition of many species since it was created by Rumphius.<ref name=ACIAR/> During the early stages of its taxonomical study, there was some confusion between durian and the [[soursop]] (''Annona muricata''), for both of these species had thorny green fruit.<ref name=Brown/> It is also interesting to note the Malay name for the soursop is ''durian Belanda'', meaning ''Dutch durian''.<ref>{{cite book | author=Davidson, Alan | title=The Oxford Companion to Food | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1999 | id=ISBN 0-19-211579-0 | pages= p. 737}}</ref> In 18th century, Weinmann considered the durian to belong to [[Chestnut|Castaneae]] as its fruit was similar to the horse chestnut.

''D. zibethinus'' was introduced into [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] by the Portuguese in the 16th century and was reintroduced many times later. It has been planted in the Americas but confined to [[botanical garden]]s. The first seedlings were sent from Kew Botanic Gardens of England, to St. Aromen of [[Dominica]] in 1884.<ref name = Agro>{{ cite web | url = http://www.worldagroforestry.org/SEA/Products/AFDbases/AF/asp/SpeciesInfo.asp?SpID=715 | title = Agroforestry Tree Database - ''Durio zibethinus'' | publisher = International Center for Research in Agroforestry | accessdate = 2007-03-12}}</ref> The durian has been cultivated for centuries at the village level, probably since the late 18th century, and commercially in south-eastern Asia since the mid 20th century.<ref name=Brown/> In his book ''My Tropic Isle'', [[Edmund James Banfield|E. J. Banfield]] tells how, in the early 20th century, a [[Singapore]] friend sent him a durian seed which he planted and cared for on his tropical island off the north coast of [[Queensland]].<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Edmund James Banfield|Banfield, E. J.]], | title=My Tropic Isle | url = http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/b/banfield/ej/b21tr/ | publisher=T. Fisher Unwin | year=1911 | accessdate = 2007-03-14}}</ref> 

In 1949, the British botanist [[E. J. H. Corner]] published ''The Durian Theory or the Origin of the Modern Tree''. His idea was that endozoochory (the enticement of animals to transport seeds in their stomach) arose before any other method of [[Biological dispersal|seed dispersal]], and that primitive ancestors of Durio species were the earliest practitioners of that strategy, especially the red durian fruit exemplifying the primitive fruit of flowering plants.

Since the early 1990s, the domestic and international demand for durian in the Association of South-East Asian Nations ([[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]]) region has increased dramatically, partly due to the increasing affluence in Asia.<ref name=Brown/>

==Uses==
===Culinary===
[[Image:Durianlog.JPG|thumb|left|A durian-flavoured [[Yule log]]]]
Durian fruit is used to flavour a wide variety of sweet edibles such as traditional Malay candy, [[ice kachang]], [[dodol]], rose biscuits, and, with a touch of modern innovation, ice cream, milkshakes, [[mooncake]]s, [[Yule log]]s and [[cappuccino]]. Pulut Durian is [[glutinous rice]] steamed with [[coconut milk]] and served with ripened durian.

Sambal Tempoyak is a [[Sumatran dish]] made from the fermented durian fruit, coconut milk, and a collection of spicy ingredients known as [[sambal]]. 

In Thailand, blocks of durian paste are sold in the markets, though much of the paste is [[Adulterant|adulterated]] with [[pumpkin]].<ref name=Morton/> Unripe durians may be cooked as vegetable, except in the Philippines, where all uses are sweet rather than savoury. Malaysians make both sugared and salted preserves from durian. When durian is minced with salt, onions and vinegar, it is called ''boder''. The durian seeds, which are the size of chestnuts, can be eaten whether they are boiled, roasted or fried in [[coconut oil]], with a texture that is similar to [[taro]] or [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], but stickier. In Java, the seeds are sliced thin and cooked with sugar as a confectionery. Uncooked durian seeds are toxic due to [[cyclopropene]] [[fatty acid]]s and should not be ingested.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.science.edu.sg/ssc/detailed.jsp?artid=3452&type=6&root=4&parent=4&cat=49 | publisher = Singapore Science Centre | title = Question No. 18085: Is it true that durian seeds are poisonous? | accessdate = 2006-03-20 | date = 2006}}</ref> Young leaves and [[shoot]]s of the durian are occasionally cooked as [[greens (vegetable)|greens]].

In Malaysia, a [[decoction]] of the leaves and roots used to be prescribed as an [[antipyretic]]. The leaf juice is applied on the head of a fever patient.<ref name=Morton/> The most complete description of the medicinal use of the durian as remedies for fevers is a Malay prescription, collected by Burkill and Haniff in 1930. It instructs the reader to boil the roots of ''[[Hibiscus rosa-sinensis]]'' with the roots of ''Durio zibethinus'', ''[[Nephelium|Nephelium longan]]'', ''Nephelium mutabile'' and ''[[Artocarpus|Artocarpus integrifolia]]'', and drink the decoction or use it as a [[poultice]].<ref>{{ cite journal | author = Burkill, I.H. and Haniff, M. | year = 1930 | title = Malay village medicine, prescriptions collected | journal = Gardens Bulletin Straits Settlements | issue = 6 | pages = p. 176<U+2013>177 }}</ref>

In 1920s, Durian Fruit Products, Inc., of New York City launched a product called "Dur-India" as a health food supplement, selling at [[US$]]9 for a dozen bottles, each containing 63 tablets. The tablets allegedly contained durian and a species of the genus ''[[Allium]]'' from India and [[vitamin E]]. The company promoted the supplement saying that they provide "more concentrated healthful energy in food form than any other product the world affords".<ref name=Morton/>

''[[Discover Magazine]]'' reported an incident where a woman ate a durian and ended up critically ill from [[hyperkalemia|potassium overdose]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Vital Signs: Potassium Overload | url = http://discovermagazine.com/2007/mar/vital-signs-a-puzzling-high-potassium | publisher = [[Discover Magazine]] | author = Dajer, Tony | date = [[2007-03-13]] | accessdate = 2007-06-19}}</ref>

==Customs and beliefs==

Southeast Asian folk beliefs, as well as [[traditional Chinese medicine]], consider the durian fruit to have warming properties liable to cause [[excessive sweating]].<ref>{{cite book | title = The Pharmacology of Chinese Herbs (Second Edition) | author = Huang, Kee C. | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | pages = p. 2 | isbn = 0849316650 | year = 1998}}</ref> The traditional method to counteract this is to pour water into the empty shell of the fruit after the pulp has been consumed, and drink it.<ref name=Davidson/> An alternative method is to eat the durian in accompaniment with [[mangosteen]] that is considered to have cooling properties. People with [[high blood pressure]] or pregnant women are traditionally advised not to consume durian.<ref name="Fuller"/><ref>{{cite book | title = Medical Anthropology in Ecological Perspective | author = McElroy, Anne and  Townsend, Patricia K. | publisher = Westview Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 0813338212 | pages = p. 253}}</ref>

Another common local belief is that the durian is harmful when eaten along with [[coffee]]<ref name=Davidson/> or alcoholic beverages.<ref name=Brown/> The latter belief can be traced back at least to 18th century when Rumphius declared that one should not drink alcohol after eating durians as it will cause indigestion and [[Halitosis|bad breath]]. J. D. Gimlette stated in his ''Malay Poisons and Charm Cures'' in 1929 that it was said that the durian fruit must not be eaten with [[brandy]]. In 1981, J. R. Croft wrote in his ''Bombacaceae: In Handbooks of the Flora of Papua New Guinea'' that a feeling of morbidity often follows the consumption of alcohol too soon after eating durian. Several medical investigations on the validity of this belief have been conducted, with varying conclusions.<ref name=Brown/>

The [[Javanese]] believe durian to have [[aphrodisiac]] qualities, and impose a strict set of rules on what may or may not be consumed with the durian or shortly after.<ref name=Davidson/> The warnings against the supposed lecherous quality of this fruit soon spread to the West, as the [[Swedenborg]]ian philosopher [[Herman Vetterling]] commented on so-called "erotic properties" of the durian in the early 20th century.<ref>{{cite book | author=Vetterling, Herman | authorlink = Herman Vetterling | title=Illuminate of Gorlitz or Jakob Bohme's Life and Philosophy, Part 3 | publisher=Kessinger Publishing | year=2003, first printed in 1923 | id=ISBN 0-7661-4788-6}} p. 1380.</ref>

[[Image:ARS Durian.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A durian fruit with its sharp thorns]]
A durian falling on a person's head can cause serious injuries because it is heavy and armed with sharp thorns, and may fall from a significant height, so wearing a [[hardhat]] is recommended when collecting the fruit. [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] writes that death rarely ensues from it, because the copious [[effusion]] of blood prevents the inflammation which might otherwise take place.<ref name=Wallace/> A common saying is that a durian has eyes and can see where it is falling, because the fruit allegedly never fall during daylight hours when people may be hurt.<ref>{{cite web | title = Encyclopedia of Asian Food | url = http://www.asiafood.org/glossary_1.cfm?alpha=D&startno=27&endno=51 | date = 1998 | accessdate = 2007-07-26 | publisher = Periplus | first = Charmaine | last = Solomon }}</ref> A saying in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], ''ketiban durian runtuh'', which translates to "getting a fallen durian", means receiving an unexpected luck or fortune.<ref>{{cite book | title = An Indonesian-English Dictionary | first = John M. |last = Echols| coauthors = Hassan Shadily |publisher= Cornell University Press |year = 1989 |isbn = 0801421276| pages = p. 292}}</ref>

A naturally spineless variety of durian growing wild in [[Davao]], Philippines was discovered in 1960s, and fruits borne on trees grown from seeds of this fruit were also spineless.<ref name=Brown/> Sometimes spineless durians are produced artificially by scraping scales off the immature fruits, since the bases of the scales develop into the spines as the fruits mature.<ref name=Brown/>

== Cultural influence ==
[[Image:The Esplanade 4, Singapore, Dec 05.JPG|right|thumb|Singapore's [[Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay|Esplanade]] building, nicknamed "The Durian"]]
The durian is commonly known as the "king of the fruits", a label that can be attributed to its formidable look and overpowering odour.<ref>The [[mangosteen]], called as the "queen of fruits", is petite and mild in comparison. The mangosteen season coincides with that of the durian and is seen as a complement, which is probably how the mangosteen received the complementary title.</ref> Due to its unusual characteristics, the durian has been referenced or parodied in various cultural mediums. To foreigners the durian is often perceived as a symbol of revulsion, as it can be seen in [[Dodoria]], one of the villains in the [[Anime|Japanese anime]] ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]''. Dodoria, whose name has been derived from the durian,<ref>{{ja icon}} {{cite web | url = http://www.dbmania.net/db-names.htm | title = <U+30C9><U+30E9><U+30B4><U+30F3><U+30DC><U+30FC><U+30EB><U+767B><U+5834><U+4EBA><U+7269><U+540D><U+524D><U+7531><U+6765> | publisher = <U+30C9><U+30E9><U+30B4><U+30F3><U+30DC><U+30FC><U+30EB><U+30DE><U+30CB><U+30A2> (Dragon Ball Mania) | accessdate = 2007-02-11}}</ref> was given an unattractive appearance and a sinister role which required slaughtering numerous characters. In the ''[[Castlevania]]'' videogame series, "Rotten Durian" is an item that removes 500 [[Hit point|HP]] from the character if consumed; its in-game description reads "Has introduced you to a whole new world of unpleasant odors." The [[role-playing game]], ''[[Tales of Destiny]]'' includes the durian (spelt Dorian by translators) as part of the edible food list. While fairly expensive and filling, the fruit, when consumed, also comes with an additional benefit of reducing random encounters by repelling monsters - no doubt with its smell.

In its native southeastern Asia, however, the durian is an everyday food and portrayed in the local media in accordance with the different cultural perception it has in the region. The durian symbolised the subjective nature of ugliness and beauty in [[Hong Kong]] director [[Fruit Chan]]'s [[2000 in film|2000 film]] ''Durian Durian'' (<U+69B4><U+69E4><U+98C4><U+98C4>, ''Liulian piao piao''), and was a nickname for the reckless but lovable protagonist of the eponymous Singaporean TV comedy ''Durian King'' played by [[Adrian Pang]].<ref name=STB>{{cite web | title = Uniquely Singapore - July 2006 Issue | url = http://www.visitsingapore.com/publish/stbportal/en/home/about_singapore/ezine_home/Jul06/local_speak/Durain_Story.html | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2007-07-31 | publisher = Singapore Tourism Board}}</ref> Likewise, the oddly shaped [[Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay|Esplanade]] building in Singapore is often called "The Durian" by locals, although its design was not based on the fruit.<ref name=STB/>

One of the names Thailand contributed to the list of storm names for Western North Pacific [[tropical cyclone]]s was '[[Typhoon Durian|Durian]]',<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/jma-eng/jma-center/rsmc-hp-pub-eg/tyname.html | title = Tropical Cyclone Names | publisher = Japan Meteorological Agency | accessdate = 2007-03-10}}</ref> which was retired after the second storm of this name in [[2006 Pacific typhoon season|2006]]. Being a fruit much loved by a variety of wild beasts, the durian sometimes signifies the long-forgotten animalistic aspect of humans, as in the legend of [[Orang Mawas]], the Malaysian version of Bigfoot, and [[Orang Pendek]], its Sumatran version, both of which have been claimed to feast on durians.<ref>{{cite web | author = Lian, Hah Foong | url = http://www.bigfootencounters.com/creatures/mawas.htm | title = Village abuzz over sighting of 'mawas' | publisher = Star Publications, Malaysia | date = [[2000-01-02]] | accessdate = 2007-03-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jambiexplorer.com/content/orangpendek.htm | title = Do 'orang pendek' really exist? | publisher = Jambiexplorer.com | accessdate = 2006-03-19 }}</ref>
