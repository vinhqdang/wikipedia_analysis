A '''fungus''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02C8>|f|<U+028C>|<U+014B>|<U+0261>|<U+0259>|s}}; [[plural]]: fungi<ref>{{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-fungi.ogg|<U+02C8>|f|<U+028C>|n|d<U+0292>|a<U+026A>}} or {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-fungi-2.ogg|<U+02C8>|f|<U+028C>|<U+014B>|<U+0261>|a<U+026A>}}</ref> or funguses<ref name=OxfordDictionary/>) is a member of a large group of [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms that includes microorganisms such as [[yeast]]s and [[mold]]s ([[spelling differences|British English]]: moulds), as well as the more familiar [[mushrooms]]. These organisms are classified as a [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], '''Fungi''', which is separate from [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[bacteria]]. One major difference is that fungal cells have [[cell wall]]s that contain [[chitin]], unlike the cell walls of plants, which contain [[cellulose]]. These and other differences show that the fungi form a single group of related organisms, named the ''Eumycota'' (''true fungi'' or ''Eumycetes''), that share a [[common ancestor]] (a ''[[monophyletic]] group''). This fungal group is distinct from the structurally similar [[myxomycetes]] (slime molds) and [[oomycetes]] (water molds). The discipline of [[biology]] devoted to the study of fungi is known as [[mycology]], which is often regarded as a branch of [[botany]], even though genetic studies have shown that fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants.

Abundant worldwide, most fungi are inconspicuous because of the small size of their structures, and their [[Crypsis|cryptic]] lifestyles in soil, on dead matter, and as [[Symbiosis|symbionts]] of plants, animals, or other fungi. They may become noticeable when [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruiting]], either as mushrooms or molds. Fungi perform an essential role in the decomposition of organic matter and have fundamental roles in [[Biogeochemical cycle|nutrient cycling]] and exchange. They have long been used as a direct source of food, such as mushrooms and [[Tuber (genus)|truffle]]s, as a [[Bread#Leavening|leavening]] agent for bread, and in [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]] of various food products, such as [[wine]], [[beer]], and [[soy sauce]]. Since the 1940s, fungi have been used for the production of [[antibiotic]]s, and, more recently, various [[enzyme]]s produced by fungi are used [[Enzyme#Industrial applications|industrially]] and in [[protease#Occurrence|detergent]]s. Fungi are also used as [[biological pesticide]]s to control weeds, plant diseases and insect pests. Many species produce [[bioactive]] compounds called [[mycotoxin]]s, such as [[alkaloid]]s and [[polyketide]]s, that are toxic to animals including humans. The fruiting structures of a few species contain [[psychotropic]] compounds and are consumed [[Recreational drug use|recreationally]] or in traditional [[Entheogens|spiritual ceremonies]]. Fungi can break down manufactured materials and buildings, and become significant [[Pathogenic fungi|pathogen]]s of humans and other animals. Losses of crops due to fungal diseases (e.g. [[rice blast disease]]) or food [[spoilage]] can have a large impact on human [[Food security|food supplies]] and local economies.

The fungus kingdom encompasses an enormous diversity of [[taxon|taxa]] with varied ecologies, [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] strategies, and [[morphology (biology)|morphologies]] ranging from single-celled aquatic [[chytrid]]s to large mushrooms. However, little is known of the true [[biodiversity]] of Kingdom Fungi, which has been estimated at around 1.5 million species, with about 5% of these having been formally classified.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Ever since the pioneering 18th and 19th century [[taxonomy|taxonomical]] works of [[Carl Linnaeus]], [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]], and [[Elias Magnus Fries]], fungi have been [[biological classification|classified]] according to their morphology (e.g., characteristics such as spore color or microscopic features) or [[physiology]]. Advances in [[molecular genetics]] have opened the way for [[DNA sequencing|DNA analysis]] to be incorporated into taxonomy, which has sometimes challenged the historical groupings based on morphology and other traits. [[Phylogenetic]] studies published in the last decade have helped reshape the classification of Kingdom Fungi, which is divided into one [[Taxonomic rank|subkingdom]], seven [[phylum|phyla]], and ten subphyla.

== Etymology ==
The English word ''fungus'' is directly adopted from the [[Latin]] ''fungus'' (mushroom), used in the writings of [[Horace]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]].<ref name=Simpson1979/> This in turn is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word ''sphongos''/<U+03C3><U+03C6><U+03BF><U+03B3><U+03B3><U+03BF><U+03C2> ("sponge"), which refers to the [[macroscopic]] structures and morphology of mushrooms and molds;<ref name=Ainsworth2/> the root is also used in other languages, such as the German ''Schwamm'' ("sponge") and ''Schimmel'' ("mold").<ref name="Mitzka1960"/> The use of the word ''mycology'', which is derived from the Greek ''mykes''/<U+03BC><U+03CD><U+03BA><U+03B7><U+03C2> (mushroom) and ''logos''/<U+03BB><U+03CC><U+03B3><U+03BF><U+03C2> (discourse),<ref>Alexopoulos ''et al''., p. 1.</ref> to denote the scientific study of fungi is thought to have originated in 1836 with English naturalist [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]]'s publication ''The English Flora of Sir James Edward Smith, Vol. 5.''<ref name=Ainsworth2>Ainsworth, p. 2.</ref>

Before the introduction of [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular methods]] for phylogenetic analysis, [[taxonomy|taxonomists]] considered fungi to be members of the [[Plant| Plant Kingdom]] because of similarities in lifestyle: both fungi and plants are mainly [[Sessility (zoology)|immobile]], and have similarities in general morphology and growth habitat. Like plants, fungi often grow in soil, and in the case of [[mushroom]]s form conspicuous [[fruiting bodies]], which sometimes bear resemblance to plants such as [[mosses]]. The fungi are now considered a separate kingdom, distinct from both plants and animals, from which they appear to have diverged around one billion years ago.<ref name=Bruns2006/><ref name="Baldauf1993">{{cite pmid|8265589}}</ref> Some morphological, biochemical, and genetic features are shared with other organisms, while others are unique to the fungi, clearly separating them from the other kingdoms:

Shared features:
* With other [[eukaryote]]s: As other eukaryotes, fungal cells contain [[membrane-bound]] [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] with [[chromosomes]] that contain DNA with [[Noncoding DNA|noncoding regions]] called [[intron]]s and coding regions called [[exons]]. In addition, fungi possess membrane-bound cytoplasmic [[organelles]] such as [[mitochondria]], [[sterol]]-containing membranes, and [[ribosomes]] of the [[80S]] type.<ref>Deacon, p. 4.</ref> They have a characteristic range of soluble carbohydrates and storage compounds, including [[sugar alcohol]]s (e.g., [[mannitol]]), [[disaccharide]]s, (e.g., [[trehalose]]), and [[polysaccharide]]s (e.g., [[glycogen]], which is also found in animals<ref name=Deacon4>Deacon, pp. 128<U+2013>29.</ref>).
* With animals: Fungi lack [[chloroplast]]s and are [[heterotroph]]ic organisms, requiring preformed [[organic compound]]s as energy sources.<ref>Alexopoulos ''et al''., pp. 28<U+2013>33.</ref>
* With plants: Fungi possess a cell wall<ref>Alexopoulos ''et al''., pp. 31<U+2013>32.</ref> and [[vacuole]]s.<ref name=Shoji2006/> They reproduce by both sexual and asexual means, and like basal plant groups (such as [[fern]]s and [[moss]]es) produce [[spore]]s. Similar to mosses and algae, fungi typically have [[haploid]] nuclei.<ref name=Deacon58>Deacon, p. 58.</ref>
* With [[euglenoid]]s and bacteria: Higher fungi, euglenoids, and some bacteria produce the [[amino acid]] <small>L</small>-lysine in specific [[biosynthesis]] steps, called the [[<U+03B1>-aminoadipate pathway]].<ref name=Zabriskie2000/><ref name=Xu2006/>
* The cells of most fungi grow as tubular, elongated, and thread-like (filamentous) structures and are called [[hyphae]], which may contain multiple nuclei and extend at their tips. Each tip contains a set of aggregated [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]]<U+2014>cellular structures consisting of [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s, and other organic molecules<U+2014>called [[Spitzenk<U+00F6>rper]].<ref>Alexopoulos ''et al''., pp. 27<U+2013>28.</ref> Both fungi and [[oomycete]]s grow as filamentous hyphal cells.<ref>Alexopoulos ''et al''., p. 685.</ref> In contrast, similar-looking organisms, such as filamentous [[green algae]], grow by repeated cell division within a chain of cells.<ref name=Deacon4/>
* In common with some plant and animal species, more than 60 fungal species display the phenomenon of [[bioluminescence]].<ref name=Desjardins2008/>

Unique features:
* Some species grow as single-celled yeasts that reproduce by [[budding]] or [[binary fission]]. [[Dimorphic fungi]] can switch between a yeast phase and a hyphal phase in response to environmental conditions.<ref name="Alexopoulos et al., p. 30">Alexopoulos ''et al''., p. 30.</ref>
* The fungal cell wall is composed of [[glucan]]s and [[chitin]]; while the former compounds are also found in plants and the latter in the [[exoskeleton]] of [[arthropods]],<ref>Alexopoulos ''et al''., pp. 32<U+2013>33.</ref><ref name=Bowman2006/> fungi are the only organisms that combine these two structural molecules in their cell wall. In contrast to plants and the oomycetes, fungal cell walls do not contain cellulose.<ref>Alexopoulos ''et al''., p. 33.</ref>

[[File:Omphalotus nidiformis Binnamittalong 2 email.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A whitish fan or funnel-shaped mushroom growing at the base of a tree.|''[[Omphalotus nidiformis]]'', a bioluminescent mushroom]]
Most fungi lack an efficient system for long-distance transport of water and nutrients, such as the [[xylem]] and [[phloem]] in many plants. To overcome these limitations, some fungi, such as ''[[Armillaria]]'', form [[Mycelial cord|rhizomorphs]],<ref name=Mikhail2005/> that resemble and perform functions similar to the [[root]]s of plants. Another characteristic shared with plants includes a [[Biochemical pathway|biosynthetic pathway]] for producing [[terpene]]s that uses [[mevalonic acid]] and [[pyrophosphate]] as [[Precursor (chemistry)|chemical building blocks]].<ref name=Keller2005/> However, plants have an additional terpene pathway in their chloroplasts, a structure fungi do not possess.<ref name=Wu2007/> Fungi produce several [[secondary metabolite]]s that are similar or identical in structure to those made by plants.<ref name=Keller2005/> Many of the plant and fungal enzymes that make these compounds differ from each other in [[peptide sequence|sequence]] and other characteristics, which indicates separate origins and evolution of these enzymes in the fungi and plants.<ref name=Keller2005/><ref name=Tudzynski2005/>

== Diversity ==
Fungi have a worldwide distribution, and grow in a wide range of habitats, including extreme environments such as [[desert fungi|deserts]] or areas with high salt concentrations<ref name=Vaupotic2008/> or [[ionizing radiation]],<ref name=Dadachova2007/> as well as in [[deep sea]] sediments.<ref name=Raghukumar1998/> Some can survive the intense [[ultraviolet radiation|UV]] and [[cosmic radiation]] encountered during space travel.<ref name=Sancho2007/> Most grow in terrestrial environments, though several species live partly or solely in aquatic habitats, such as the [[chytrid]] fungus ''[[Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]'', a [[parasite]] that has been responsible for a worldwide decline in [[amphibian]] populations. This organism spends part of its life cycle as a motile [[zoospore]], enabling it to propel itself through water and enter its amphibian host.<ref name=Brem2008/> Other examples of aquatic fungi include those living in [[hydrothermal]] areas of the ocean.<ref name=LeCalvez2009/>

Around 100,000 species of fungi have been formally described by [[taxonomy|taxonomists]],<ref>This estimation is determined by combining the species count for each phyla, based on values obtained from the 10th edition of the ''Dictionary of the Fungi'' (Kirk ''et al''., 2008): Ascomycota, 64163 species (p. 55); Basidiomycota, 31515 (p. 78); Blastocladiomycota, 179 (p. 94); Chytridiomycota, 706 (p. 142); Glomeromycota, 169 (p. 287); Microsporidia, >1300 (p. 427); Neocallimastigomycota, 20 (p. 463).</ref> but the global biodiversity of the fungus kingdom is not fully understood.<ref name=Mueller2006/> On the basis of observations of the ratio of the number of fungal species to the number of plant species in selected environments, the fungal kingdom has been estimated to contain about 1.5 million species;<ref name=Hawksworth2006b/> a recent (2011) estimate suggests there may be over 5 million species.<ref name=Blackwell2011/> In mycology, [[species]] have historically been distinguished by a variety of methods and concepts. Classification based on [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] characteristics, such as the size and shape of spores or fruiting structures, has traditionally dominated fungal taxonomy.<ref name="Kirk et al., p. 489">Kirk ''et al''., p. 489.</ref> Species may also be distinguished by their [[Biochemistry|biochemical]] and [[physiology|physiological]] characteristics, such as their ability to metabolize certain biochemicals, or their reaction to [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification|chemical tests]]. The [[Species#The isolation species concept in more detail|biological species concept]] discriminates species based on their ability to [[mating in fungi|mate]]. The application of [[Molecular biology|molecular]] tools, such as [[DNA sequencing]] and phylogenetic analysis, to study diversity has greatly enhanced the resolution and added robustness to estimates of [[genetic diversity]] within various taxonomic groups.<ref name=Hibbett2007/>

== Morphology ==
=== Microscopic structures ===
[[File:Penicillium labeled cropped.jpg|thumb|330px|right|alt=Monochrome micrograph showing ''Penicillium'' hyphae as long, transparent, tube-like structures a few micrometres across. Conidiophores branch out laterally from the hyphae, terminating in bundles of phialides on which spherical condidiophores are arranged like beads on a string. Septa are faintly visible as dark lines crossing the hyphae.|An environmental isolate of ''[[Penicillium]]''<br>1.&nbsp;[[hypha]] 2.&nbsp;[[conidiophore]] 3.&nbsp;[[phialide]] 4.&nbsp;[[conidia]] 5.&nbsp;[[septum|septa]]]]
Most fungi grow as [[hypha]]e, which are cylindrical, thread-like structures 2<U+2013>10&nbsp;[[micrometres|<U+00B5>m]] in diameter and up to several centimeters in length. Hyphae grow at their tips (apices); new hyphae are typically formed by emergence of new tips along existing hyphae by a process called ''branching'', or occasionally growing hyphal tips bifurcate (fork) giving rise to two parallel-growing hyphae.<ref name=Harris2008/> The combination of apical growth and branching/forking leads to the development of a [[mycelium]], an interconnected network of hyphae.<ref name="Alexopoulos et al., p. 30"/> Hyphae can be either [[septum|septate]] or [[coenocytic]]: septate hyphae are divided into compartments separated by cross walls (internal cell walls, called septa, that are formed at [[right angle]]s to the cell wall giving the hypha its shape), with each compartment containing one or more nuclei; coenocytic hyphae are not compartmentalized.<ref>Deacon, p. 51.</ref> Septa have [[Pit connection#Characteristics|pores]] that allow [[cytoplasm]], [[organelle]]s, and sometimes nuclei to pass through; an example is the dolipore septum in the fungi of the phylum Basidiomycota.<ref>Deacon, p. 57.</ref> Coenocytic hyphae are essentially [[multinucleate]] supercells.<ref name=Chang2004/>

Many species have developed specialized hyphal structures for nutrient uptake from living hosts; examples include [[haustoria]] in plant-parasitic species of most fungal phyla, and [[arbuscular mycorrhiza|arbuscules]] of several [[mycorrhiza]]l fungi, which penetrate into the host cells to consume nutrients.<ref name=Parniske2008/>

Although fungi are [[opisthokont]]s<U+2014>a grouping of evolutionarily related organisms broadly characterized by a single posterior [[flagellum]]<U+2014>all phyla except for the [[chytrids]] have lost their posterior flagella.<ref name=Steenkamp2006/> Fungi are unusual among the eukaryotes in having a cell wall that, in addition to [[glucan]]s (e.g., <U+03B2>-1,3-glucan) and other typical components, also contains the [[biopolymer]] chitin.<ref name=Stevens2006/>

=== Macroscopic structures ===
[[File:Armillaria ostoyae MO.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A cluster of large, thick-stemmed light brown colored gilled mushrooms growing at the base of a tree|''[[Armillaria solidipes]]'']]
Fungal mycelia can become visible to the naked eye, for example, on various surfaces and substrates, such as damp walls and on spoiled food, where they are commonly called [[mold]]s. Mycelia grown on solid [[agar]] media in laboratory [[petri dish]]es are usually referred to as [[colony (biology)|colonies]]. These colonies can exhibit growth shapes and colors (due to spores or [[pigment]]ation) that can be used as diagnostic features in the identification of species or groups.<ref>Hanson, pp. 127<U+2013>41.</ref> Some individual fungal colonies can reach extraordinary dimensions and ages as in the case of a [[Clone (cell biology)|clonal]] colony of ''[[Armillaria solidipes]]'', which extends over an area of more than 900&nbsp;[[hectare|ha]] (3.5 square miles), with an estimated age of nearly 9,000&nbsp;years.<ref name=Ferguson2003/>

The [[apothecium]]<U+2014>a specialized structure important in [[sexual reproduction]] in the ascomycetes<U+2014>is a cup-shaped [[fruiting body]] that holds the [[hymenium]], a layer of tissue containing the spore-bearing cells.<ref>Alexopoulos ''et al''., pp. 204<U+2013>205.</ref> The fruiting bodies of the basidiomycetes ([[basidiocarp]]s) and some ascomycetes can sometimes grow very large, and many are well known as [[mushroom]]s.

== Growth and physiology ==
[[File:DecayingPeachSmall.gif|frame|left|alt=Time-lapse photography sequence of a [[peach]] becoming progressively discolored and disfigured|[[Mold]] growth covering a decaying [[peach]]. The frames were taken approximately 12 hours apart over a period of six days.]]

The growth of fungi as hyphae on or in solid substrates or as single cells in aquatic environments is adapted for the efficient extraction of nutrients, because these growth forms have high [[surface area to volume ratio]]s.<ref name=Moss1986/> Hyphae are specifically adapted for growth on solid surfaces, and to invade [[substrate (biology)|substrates]] and tissues.<ref name=Penalva2002/> They can exert large penetrative mechanical forces; for example, the [[plant pathogen]] ''[[Magnaporthe grisea]]'' forms a structure called an [[appressorium]] that evolved to puncture plant tissues.<ref name=Howard1991/> The pressure generated by the appressorium, directed against the plant [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]], can exceed {{convert|8|MPa|lk=in}}.<ref name=Howard1991/> The filamentous fungus ''[[Paecilomyces lilacinus]]'' uses a similar structure to penetrate the eggs of [[nematode]]s.<ref name=Money1997/>

The mechanical pressure exerted by the appressorium is generated from physiological processes that increase intracellular [[turgor]] by producing [[osmolyte]]s such as [[glycerol]].<ref name=Wang2005/> Morphological adaptations such as these are complemented by [[cellulase|hydrolytic enzymes]] secreted into the environment to digest large organic molecules<U+2014>such as [[polysaccharide]]s, [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s, and other organic substrates<U+2014>into smaller molecules that may then be absorbed as nutrients.<ref name=Pereira2007/><ref name=Schaller2007/><ref name=Farrar1985/> The vast majority of filamentous fungi grow in a polar fashion<U+2014>i.e., by extension into one direction<U+2014>by elongation at the tip (apex) of the hypha.<ref name=Fischer2008/> Alternative forms of fungal growth include intercalary extension (i.e., by longitudinal expansion of hyphal compartments that are below the apex) as in the case of some [[Endophyte|endophytic]] fungi,<ref name=Christensen2008/> or growth by volume expansion during the development of mushroom [[stipe (mycology)|stipes]] and other large organs.<ref name=Money2002/> Growth of fungi as [[Multicellularity|multicellular structures]] consisting of [[somatic]] and reproductive cells<U+2014>a feature independently evolved in animals and plants<ref name=Willensdorfer2009/><U+2014>has several functions, including the development of fruiting bodies for dissemination of sexual spores (see above) and [[biofilm]]s for substrate colonization and [[intercellular communication]].<ref name=Daniels2006/>

The fungi are traditionally considered [[heterotroph]]s, organisms that rely solely on [[carbon fixation|carbon fixed]] by other organisms for [[metabolism]]. Fungi have [[evolution|evolved]] a high degree of metabolic versatility that allows them to use a diverse range of organic substrates for growth, including simple compounds such as [[nitrate]], [[ammonia]], [[acetate]], or [[ethanol]].<ref name=Marzluf1981/><ref name=Heynes1994/> For some species it has been shown that the pigment [[melanin]] may play a role in extracting energy from [[ionizing radiation]], such as [[gamma rays|gamma radiation]]; however, this form of [[radiotrophic fungus|"radiotrophic"]] growth has been described for only a few species, the effects on growth rates are small, and the underlying [[Biophysics|biophysical]] and biochemical processes are not known.<ref name=Dadachova2007/> The authors speculate that this process might bear similarity to [[carbon fixation|CO<sub>2</sub> fixation]] via [[Visible spectrum|visible light]], but instead utilizing ionizing radiation as a source of energy.<ref name=Dadachova2008/>

== Reproduction ==
[[File:Polyporus squamosus Molter.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Two thickly stemmed brownish mushrooms with scales on the upper surface, growing out of a tree trunk|''[[Polyporus squamosus]]'']]
Fungal reproduction is complex, reflecting the differences in lifestyles and genetic makeup within this diverse kingdom of organisms.<ref>Alexopoulos ''et al''., pp. 48<U+2013>56.</ref> It is estimated that a third of all fungi reproduce using more than one method of propagation; for example, reproduction may occur in two well-differentiated stages within the [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] of a species, the [[teleomorph]] and the [[anamorph]].<ref>Kirk ''et al''., p. 633.</ref> Environmental conditions trigger genetically determined developmental states that lead to the creation of specialized structures for sexual or asexual reproduction. These structures aid reproduction by efficiently dispersing spores or spore-containing [[propagule]]s.

=== Asexual reproduction ===
[[Asexual reproduction]] via vegetative spores ([[conidium|conidia]]) or through mycelial fragmentation is common; it maintains [[clone (genetics)|clonal]] populations adapted to a specific [[Ecological niche|niche]], and allows more rapid dispersal than sexual reproduction.<ref name=Heitman2005/> The "Fungi imperfecti" (fungi lacking the perfect or sexual stage) or [[Deuteromycota]] comprise all the species which lack an observable sexual cycle.<ref name=Alcamo2004/>

=== Sexual reproduction ===
Sexual reproduction with [[meiosis]] exists in all fungal phyla (with the exception of the [[Glomeromycota]]).<ref name=<ref name=Redecker2006/> It differs in many aspects from sexual reproduction in animals or plants. Differences also exist between fungal groups and can be used to discriminate species by morphological differences in sexual structures and reproductive strategies.<ref name=Guarro1999/><ref name=Taylor2000/> [[Mating in fungi|Mating]] experiments between fungal isolates may identify species on the basis of biological species concepts.<ref name=Taylor2000/> The major fungal groupings have initially been delineated based on the morphology of their sexual structures and spores; for example, the spore-containing structures, [[ascus|asci]] and [[basidium|basidia]], can be used in the identification of ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, respectively. Some species may allow mating only between individuals of opposite [[mating type]], while others can mate and sexually reproduce with any other individual or itself. Species of the former [[mating system]] are called [[heterothallic]], and of the latter [[homothallic]].<ref name=Metzenberg1990/>

Most fungi have both an [[haploid]] and [[diploid]] stage in their life cycles. In sexually reproducing fungi, compatible individuals may combine by fusing their hyphae together into an interconnected network; this process, [[anastomosis]], is required for the initiation of the sexual cycle. Ascomycetes and basidiomycetes go through a [[dikaryotic]] stage, in which the nuclei inherited from the two parents do not combine immediately after cell fusion, but remain separate in the hyphal cells (see [[heterokaryosis]]).<ref>Jennings and Lysek, pp. 107<U+2013>114.</ref>
[[File:Morelasci.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Microscopic view of numerous translucent or transparent elongated sac-like structures each containing eight spheres lined up in a row|The 8-spored asci of ''[[Morchella elata]]'', viewed with [[phase contrast microscopy]]]]

In ascomycetes, dikaryotic hyphae of the [[hymenium]] (the spore-bearing tissue layer) form a characteristic ''hook'' at the hyphal septum. During [[cell division]], formation of the hook ensures proper distribution of the newly divided nuclei into the apical and basal hyphal compartments. An ascus (plural ''asci'') is then formed, in which [[karyogamy]] (nuclear fusion) occurs. Asci are embedded in an [[ascocarp]], or fruiting body. Karyogamy in the asci is followed immediately by meiosis and the production of [[ascospore]]s. After dispersal, the ascospores may germinate and form a new haploid mycelium.<ref>Deacon, p. 31.</ref>

Sexual reproduction in basidiomycetes is similar to that of the ascomycetes. Compatible haploid hyphae fuse to produce a dikaryotic mycelium. However, the dikaryotic phase is more extensive in the basidiomycetes, often also present in the vegetatively growing mycelium. A specialized anatomical structure, called a [[clamp connection]], is formed at each hyphal septum. As with the structurally similar hook in the ascomycetes, the clamp connection in the basidiomycetes is required for controlled transfer of nuclei during cell division, to maintain the dikaryotic stage with two genetically different nuclei in each hyphal compartment.<ref>Alexopoulos ''et al''., pp. 492<U+2013>493.</ref> A [[basidiocarp]] is formed in which club-like structures known as [[basidia]] generate haploid [[basidiospores]] after karyogamy and meiosis.<ref>Jennings and Lysek, p. 142.</ref> The most commonly known basidiocarps are mushrooms, but they may also take other forms (see [[Fungus#Morphology|Morphology]] section).

In glomeromycetes (formerly zygomycetes), haploid hyphae of two individuals fuse, forming a [[gametangium]], a specialized cell structure that becomes a fertile [[gamete]]-producing cell. The gametangium develops into a [[zygospore]], a thick-walled spore formed by the union of gametes. When the zygospore germinates, it undergoes [[meiosis]], generating new haploid hyphae, which may then form asexual [[sporangiospore]]s. These sporangiospores allow the fungus to rapidly disperse and germinate into new genetically identical haploid fungal mycelia.<ref>Deacon, pp. 21<U+2013>24.</ref>

=== Spore dispersal ===
Both asexual and sexual spores or sporangiospores are often actively dispersed by forcible ejection from their reproductive structures. This ejection ensures exit of the spores from the reproductive structures as well as traveling through the air over long distances.[[File:Cyathus stercoreus Fruchtk<U+00F6>rper.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A brown, cup-shaped fungus with several greyish disc-shaped structures lying within|The bird's nest fungus ''[[Cyathus stercoreus]]'']] Specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms, as well as spore surface structures (such as [[hydrophobin]]s), enable efficient spore ejection.<ref name=Linder2005/> For example, the structure of the [[ascus|spore-bearing cells]] in some ascomycete species is such that the buildup of [[osmolyte|substances]] affecting cell volume and fluid balance enables the explosive discharge of spores into the air.<ref name=Trail2007/> The forcible discharge of single spores termed ''ballistospores'' involves formation of a small drop of water (Buller's drop), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000&nbsp;[[G-force|g]];<ref name=Pringle2005/> the net result is that the spore is ejected 0.01<U+2013>0.02&nbsp;cm, sufficient distance for it to fall through the gills or pores into the air below.<ref>Kirk ''et al''., p. 495.</ref> Other fungi, like the [[puffballs]], rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces. The [[Nidulariaceae|bird's nest fungi]] use the force of falling water drops to liberate the spores from cup-shaped fruiting bodies.<ref name=Brodie1975/> Another strategy is seen in the [[stinkhorns]], a group of fungi with lively colors and putrid odor that attract insects to disperse their spores.<ref>Alexopoulos ''et al''., p. 545.</ref>

=== Other sexual processes ===
Besides regular sexual reproduction with meiosis, certain fungi, such as those in the genera ''[[Penicillium]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus]]'', may exchange genetic material via [[parasexuality|parasexual]] processes, initiated by anastomosis between hyphae and [[plasmogamy]] of fungal cells.<ref>Jennings and Lysek, pp. 114<U+2013>115.</ref> The frequency and relative importance of parasexual events is unclear and may be lower than other sexual processes. It is known to play a role in intraspecific hybridization<ref name=Furlaneto1992/> and is likely required for hybridization between species, which has been associated with major events in fungal evolution.<ref name=Schardl2003/>

== Evolution ==
{{Main|Evolution of fungi}}

In contrast to [[Evolutionary history of plants|plants]] and [[Evolutionary history of life|animals]], the early fossil record of the fungi is meager. Factors that likely contribute to the under-representation of fungal species among fossils include the nature of fungal [[sporocarp (fungi)|fruiting bodies]], which are soft, fleshy, and easily degradable tissues and the microscopic dimensions of most fungal structures, which therefore are not readily evident. Fungal fossils are difficult to distinguish from those of other microbes, and are most easily identified when they resemble [[Extant taxon|extant]] fungi.<ref name=Donoghue2004/> Often recovered from a [[Permineralization|permineralized]] plant or animal host, these samples are typically studied by making thin-section preparations that can be examined with [[optical microscope|light microscopy]] or [[transmission electron microscopy]].<ref>Taylor and Taylor, p. 19.</ref> [[Compression fossil]]s are studied by dissolving the surrounding matrix with acid and then using light or [[scanning electron microscopy]] to examine surface details.<ref>Taylor and Taylor, pp. 7<U+2013>12.</ref>

The earliest fossils possessing features typical of fungi date to the [[Proterozoic]] eon, some {{Ma|1430}} ([[annum|Ma]]); these multicellular [[benthic]] organisms had filamentous structures with septa, and were capable of anastomosis.<ref name=Butterfield2005/> More recent studies (2009) estimate the arrival of fungal organisms at about 760<U+2013>1060&nbsp;Ma on the basis of comparisons of the rate of evolution in closely related groups.<ref name=Lucking2009/> For much of the [[Paleozoic]] Era (542<U+2013>251&nbsp;Ma), the fungi appear to have been aquatic and consisted of organisms similar to the extant [[chytrid]]s in having flagellum-bearing spores.<ref name=James2006b/> The evolutionary adaptation from an aquatic to a terrestrial lifestyle necessitated a diversification of ecological strategies for obtaining nutrients, including [[parasitism]], [[Saphrotrophic nutrition|saprobism]], and the development of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationships such as [[mycorrhiza]] and lichenization.<ref>Taylor and Taylor, pp. 84<U+2013>94 and 106<U+2013>107.</ref> Recent (2009) studies suggest that the ancestral ecological state of the [[Ascomycota]] was saprobism, and that independent [[lichen]]ization events have occurred multiple times.<ref name=Schoch2009/>

The fungi probably colonized the land during the [[Cambrian]] (542<U+2013>488.3&nbsp;Ma), long before land plants.<ref name=Brundrett2002/> Fossilized hyphae and spores recovered from the [[Ordovician]] of Wisconsin (460&nbsp;Ma) resemble modern-day [[Glomerales]], and existed at a time when the land flora likely consisted of only non-vascular [[bryophyte]]-like plants.<ref name=Redecker2000/> [[Prototaxites]], which was probably a fungus or lichen, would have been the tallest organism of the late [[Silurian]]. Fungal fossils do not become common and uncontroversial until the early [[Devonian]] (416<U+2013>359.2&nbsp;Ma), when they are abundant in the [[Rhynie chert]], mostly as [[Zygomycota]] and [[Chytridiomycota]].<ref name=Brundrett2002/><ref name=Taylor1996/><ref name=Dotzler2009/> At about this same time, approximately 400&nbsp;Ma, the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota diverged,<ref name=Taylor2006/> and all modern [[Class (biology)|classes]] of fungi were present by the Late [[Carboniferous]] ([[Pennsylvanian]], 318.1<U+2013>299&nbsp;Ma).<ref name="urlFungi"/>

[[Lichen]]-like fossils have been found in the [[Doushantuo Formation]] in southern China dating back to 635<U+2013>551&nbsp;Ma.<ref name=Yuan2005/> Lichens were a component of the early terrestrial ecosystems, and the estimated age of the oldest terrestrial lichen fossil is 400&nbsp;Ma;<ref name=Karatygin2009/> this date corresponds to the age of the oldest known [[sporocarp (fungi)|sporocarp]] fossil, a ''Paleopyrenomycites'' species found in the Rhynie Chert.<ref name=Taylor2005/> The oldest fossil with microscopic features resembling modern-day basidiomycetes is ''Palaeoancistrus'', found permineralized with a [[fern]] from the Pennsylvanian.<ref name=Dennis1970/> Rare in the fossil record are the Homobasidiomycetes (a [[taxon]] roughly equivalent to the mushroom-producing species of the [[Agaricomycetes]]). Two [[amber]]-preserved specimens provide evidence that the earliest known mushroom-forming fungi (the extinct species ''[[Archaeomarasmius leggetti]]'') appeared during the mid-[[Cretaceous]], 90&nbsp;Ma.<ref name=Hibbett1995/><ref name=Hibbett1997/>

Some time after the [[Permian<U+2013>Triassic extinction event]] (251.4&nbsp;Ma), a fungal spike (originally thought to be an extraordinary abundance of fungal spores in [[sediment]]s) formed, suggesting that fungi were the dominant life form at this time, representing nearly 100% of the available [[fossil record]] for this period.<ref name=Eshet1995/> However, the relative proportion of fungal spores relative to spores formed by [[algae|algal]] species is difficult to assess,<ref name=Foster2002/> the spike did not appear worldwide,<ref name=LopezGomez2005/><ref name=Looy2005/> and in many places it did not fall on the Permian<U+2013>Triassic boundary.<ref name=Ward2005/>

Although commonly included in botany curricula and textbooks, fungi are more closely related to [[animal]]s than to plants and are placed with the animals in the [[monophyletic]] group of [[opisthokont]]s.<ref name=ShalchianTabrizi2008/> Analyses using [[molecular phylogenetics]] support a [[monophyletic group|monophyletic]] origin of the Fungi.<ref name=Hibbett2007/> The [[taxonomy]] of the Fungi is in a state of constant flux, especially due to recent research based on DNA comparisons. These current phylogenetic analyses often overturn classifications based on older and sometimes less discriminative methods based on morphological features and biological species concepts obtained from experimental [[mating]]s.<ref>See [http://www.palaeos.com/Fungi/default.htm Palaeos: Fungi] for an introduction to fungal taxonomy, including recent controversies.</ref>

There is no unique generally accepted system at the higher taxonomic levels and there are frequent name changes at every level, from species upwards. Efforts among researchers are now underway to establish and encourage usage of a unified and more consistent [[Botanical nomenclature|nomenclature]].<ref name=Hibbett2007/><ref name=Celio2006/> Fungal species can also have multiple scientific names depending on their life cycle and mode (sexual or asexual) of reproduction. Web sites such as [[Index Fungorum]] and [[Integrated Taxonomic Information System|ITIS]] list current names of fungal species (with cross-references to older synonyms).

The 2007 classification of Kingdom Fungi is the result of a large-scale collaborative research effort involving dozens of mycologists and other scientists working on fungal taxonomy.<ref name=Hibbett2007/> It recognizes seven [[phylum|phyla]], two of which<U+2014>the Ascomycota and the Basidiomycota<U+2014>are contained within a branch representing [[subkingdom]] Dikarya. The below [[cladogram]] depicts the major fungal [[Taxon|taxa]] and their relationship to opisthokont and unikont organisms. The lengths of the branches in this tree are not proportional to [[evolutionary]] distances.

=== Taxonomic groups ===
{{See also|List of fungal orders}}

The major [[phylum|phyla]] (sometimes called divisions) of fungi have been classified mainly on the basis of characteristics of their sexual [[reproduction|reproductive]] structures. Currently, seven phyla are proposed: Microsporidia, Chytridiomycota, Blastocladiomycota, Neocallimastigomycota, Glomeromycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota.<ref name=Hibbett2007/>

[[File:Arbuscular mycorrhiza microscope.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Microscopic view of a layer of translucent grayish-colored cells, some containing small darkly colored spheres|''[[Arbuscular mycorrhiza]]'' seen under microscope. [[Flax]] root cortical cells containing paired arbuscules.]]

Phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated that the [[Microsporidia]], unicellular parasites of animals and protists, are fairly recent and highly derived [[endobiotic]] fungi (living within the tissue of another species).<ref name=James2006b/><ref name=Gill2006/> One 2006 study concludes that the Microsporidia are a sister group to the true fungi; that is, they are each other's closest evolutionary relative.<ref name=Liu2006/> Hibbett and colleagues suggest that this analysis does not clash with their classification of the Fungi, and although the Microsporidia are elevated to phylum status, it is acknowledged that further analysis is required to clarify evolutionary relationships within this group.<ref name=Hibbett2007/>

The [[Chytridiomycota]] are commonly known as chytrids. These fungi are distributed worldwide. Chytrids produce [[zoospore]]s that are capable of active movement through aqueous phases with a single [[flagellum]], leading early [[taxonomist]]s to classify them as [[protist]]s. [[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular phylogenies]], inferred from [[rRNA]] sequences in [[ribosome]]s, suggest that the Chytrids are a [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] group divergent from the other fungal phyla, consisting of four major [[clade]]s with suggestive evidence for [[paraphyly]] or possibly [[polyphyly]].<ref name=James2006/>

The [[Blastocladiomycota]] were previously considered a taxonomic clade within the Chytridiomycota. Recent molecular data and [[ultrastructure|ultrastructural]] characteristics, however, place the Blastocladiomycota as a sister clade to the Zygomycota, Glomeromycota, and Dikarya (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota). The blastocladiomycetes are [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprotrophs]], feeding on decomposing organic matter, and they are parasites of all eukaryotic groups. Unlike their close relatives, the chytrids, most of which exhibit [[Biological life cycle#Haplontic life cycle|zygotic meiosis]], the blastocladiomycetes undergo [[Biological life cycle#Haplodiplontic life cycle|sporic meiosis]].<ref name=James2006b/>

The [[Neocallimastigomycota]] were earlier placed in the phylum Chytridomycota. Members of this small phylum are [[anaerobic organism]]s, living in the digestive system of larger herbivorous mammals and possibly in other terrestrial and aquatic environments. They lack [[mitochondria]] but contain [[hydrogenosome]]s of mitochondrial origin. As the related chrytrids, neocallimastigomycetes form zoospores that are posteriorly uniflagellate or polyflagellate.<ref name=Hibbett2007/>

Members of the [[Glomeromycota]] form [[arbuscular mycorrhizae]], a form of [[symbiosis]] wherein fungal hyphae invade plant root cells and both species benefit from the resulting increased supply of nutrients. All known Glomeromycota species reproduce asexually.<ref name=Redecker2006/> The symbiotic association between the Glomeromycota and plants is ancient, with evidence dating to 400 million years ago.<ref name=Remy1994/> Formerly part of the [[Zygomycota]] (commonly known as 'sugar' and 'pin' molds), the Glomeromycota were elevated to phylum status in 2001 and now replace the older phylum Zygomycota.<ref name=Schussler2001/> Fungi that were placed in the Zygomycota are now being reassigned to the Glomeromycota, or the subphyla [[incertae sedis]] [[Mucoromycotina]], [[Kickxellomycotina]], the [[Zoopagomycotina]] and the [[Entomophthoromycotina]].<ref name=Hibbett2007/> Some well-known examples of fungi formerly in the Zygomycota include black bread mold (''[[Rhizopus stolonifer]]''), and ''[[Pilobolus]]'' species, capable of ejecting [[spore]]s several meters through the air.<ref>Alexopoulos ''et al''., p. 145.</ref> Medically relevant genera include ''[[Mucor]]'', ''[[Rhizomucor]]'', and ''[[Rhizopus]]''.

[[File:Ascocarp2.png|thumb|right|alt=Cross-section of a cup-shaped structure showing locations of developing meiotic asci (upper edge of cup, left side, arrows pointing to two gray-colored cells containing four and two small circles), sterile hyphae (upper edge of cup, right side, arrows pointing to white-colored cells with a single small circle in them), and mature asci (upper edge of cup, pointing to two gray-colored cells with eight small circles in them)|Diagram of an [[apothecium]] (the typical cup-like reproductive structure of Ascomycetes) showing sterile tissues as well as developing and mature asci.]]

The [[Ascomycota]], commonly known as sac fungi or ascomycetes, constitute the largest taxonomic group within the Eumycota.<ref name="Kirk et al., p. 489"/> These fungi form meiotic spores called [[ascospore]]s, which are enclosed in a special sac-like structure called an [[ascus]]. This phylum includes [[morel]]s, a few [[mushroom]]s and [[Tuber (genus)|truffle]]s, single-celled [[yeast]]s (e.g., of the genera ''[[Saccharomyces]]'', ''[[Kluyveromyces]]'', ''[[Pichia]]'', and ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]''), and many filamentous fungi living as saprotrophs, parasites, and mutualistic symbionts. Prominent and important genera of filamentous ascomycetes include ''[[Aspergillus]]'', ''[[Penicillium]]'', ''[[Fusarium]]'', and ''[[Claviceps]]''. Many ascomycete species have only been observed undergoing asexual reproduction (called [[anamorph]]ic species), but analysis of molecular data has often been able to identify their closest [[teleomorph]]s in the Ascomycota.<ref name=Samuels2006/> Because the products of meiosis are retained within the sac-like ascus, ascomycetes have been used for elucidating principles of genetics and heredity (e.g., ''[[Neurospora crassa]]'').<ref name=Radford1997/>

Members of the [[Basidiomycota]], commonly known as the club fungi or basidiomycetes, produce meiospores called [[basidiospore]]s on club-like stalks called [[basidium|basidia]]. Most common mushrooms belong to this group, as well as [[rust (fungus)|rust]] and [[smut (fungus)|smut fungi]], which are major pathogens of grains. Other important basidiomycetes include the [[maize]] pathogen ''[[Ustilago maydis]]'',<ref name=Valverde1995/> human [[commensalism|commensal]] species of the genus ''[[Malassezia]]'',<ref name=Zisova2009/> and the [[opportunistic infection|opportunistic]] human pathogen, ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]''.<ref name=Perfect2006/>

=== Fungus-like organisms ===
Because of similarities in morphology and lifestyle, the slime molds (myxomycetes) and water molds (oomycetes) were formerly classified in the kingdom Fungi. Unlike true fungi the cell walls of these organisms contain cellulose and lack chitin. Myxomycetes are [[unikont]]s like fungi, but are grouped in the [[Amoebozoa]]. Oomycetes are diploid [[bikont]]s, grouped in the [[Chromalveolate]] kingdom. Neither water molds nor slime molds are closely related to the true fungi, and, therefore, [[taxonomist]]s no longer group them in the kingdom Fungi. Nonetheless, studies of the oomycetes and myxomycetes are still often included in [[mycology]] textbooks and primary research literature.<ref name=Blackwell2004/>

The [[Rozellida]] clade, including the "chytrid" ''[[Rozella]]'', is a genetically disparate group known mostly from environmental DNA sequences that is a sister group to fungi. Members of the group that have been isolated lack the chitinous cell wall that is characteristic of fungi.

The [[nucleariid]]s, currently grouped in the [[Choanozoa]], may be the next sister group to the eumycete clade, and as such could be included in an expanded fungal kingdom.<ref name=Tabrizi2008/>

== Ecology ==
Although often inconspicuous, fungi occur in every environment on [[Earth]] and play very important roles in most [[ecosystems]]. Along with bacteria, fungi are the major [[decomposers]] in most terrestrial (and some aquatic) ecosystems, and therefore play a critical role in [[biogeochemical cycles]]<ref name=Gadd2007/> and in many [[food webs]]. As decomposers, they play an essential role in [[nutrient cycling]], especially as [[saprotroph]]s and [[symbiont]]s, degrading [[organic matter]] to inorganic molecules, which can then re-enter anabolic metabolic pathways in plants or other organisms.<ref name=Lindahl2007/><ref name=Barea2005/>

=== Symbiosis ===
Many fungi have important [[symbiotic]] relationships with organisms from most if not all [[Kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]]s.<ref name=Aanen2006/><ref name=Nikoh2000/><ref name=Perotto1997/> These interactions can be [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] or antagonistic in nature, or in the case of [[commensal]] fungi are of no apparent benefit or detriment to the host.<ref name=Arnold2003/><ref name=Paszkowski2006/><ref name=Hube2004/>

==== With plants ====
[[Mycorrhiza]]l symbiosis between [[plants]] and fungi is one of the most well-known plant<U+2013>fungus associations and is of significant importance for plant growth and persistence in many ecosystems; over 90% of all plant species engage in mycorrhizal relationships with fungi and are dependent upon this relationship for survival.<ref name=Bonfante2003/>
[[File:Neotyphodium coenophialum.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A microscopic view of blue-stained cells, some with dark wavy lines in them|The dark filaments are [[hyphae]] of the endophytic fungus ''[[Neotyphodium coenophialum]]'' in the intercellular spaces of [[Festuca arundinacea|tall fescue]] leaf sheath tissue]]
The mycorrhizal symbiosis is ancient, dating to at least 400 million years ago.<ref name=Remy1994/> It often increases the plant's uptake of inorganic compounds, such as [[nitrate]] and [[phosphate]] from soils having low concentrations of these key plant nutrients.<ref name=Lindahl2007/><ref name=Heijden2006/> The fungal partners may also mediate plant-to-plant transfer of carbohydrates and other nutrients. Such mycorrhizal communities are called "common mycorrhizal networks".<ref name=Selosse2006/> A special case of mycorrhiza is myco-heterotrophy, whereby the plant parasitizes the fungus, obtaining all of its nutrients from its fungal symbiont.<ref name=Merckx2009/> Some fungal species inhabit the tissues inside roots, stems, and leaves, in which case they are called endophytes.<ref name=Schulz2005/> Similar to mycorrhiza, endophytic colonization by fungi may benefit both symbionts; for example, endophytes of grasses impart to their host increased resistance to herbivores and other environmental stresses and receive food and shelter from the plant in return.<ref name=Clay2002/>

==== With algae and cyanobacteria ====
[[File:Lobaria pulmonaria 010108a.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A green, leaf-like structure attached to a tree, with a pattern of ridges and depression on the bottom surface|The lichen ''[[Lobaria pulmonaria]]'', a symbiosis of fungal, [[algae|algal]], and [[cyanobacteria]]l species]]
[[Lichens]] are formed by a symbiotic relationship between [[algae]] or [[cyanobacteria]] (referred to in lichen terminology as "photobionts") and fungi (mostly various species of [[ascomycete]]s and a few [[basidiomycete]]s), in which individual photobiont cells are embedded in a tissue formed by the fungus.<ref name=Brodo2001/> Lichens occur in every ecosystem on all continents, play a key role in [[soil formation]] and the initiation of [[Ecological succession|biological succession]],<ref name=Raven2005/> and are the dominating life forms in extreme environments, including [[polar region|polar]], [[Alpine climate|alpine]], and [[semiarid climate|semiarid]] desert regions.<ref>Deacon, p. 267.</ref> They are able to grow on inhospitable surfaces, including bare soil, rocks, [[Bark|tree bark]], wood, shells, barnacles and leaves.<ref name=Purvis2000/> As in [[mycorrhiza]]s, the photobiont provides sugars and other carbohydrates via [[photosynthesis]], while the fungus provides minerals and water. The functions of both symbiotic organisms are so closely intertwined that they function almost as a single organism; in most cases the resulting organism differs greatly from the individual components. Lichenization is a common mode of nutrition; around 20% of fungi<U+2014>between 17,500 and 20,000 described species<U+2014>are lichenized.<ref>Kirk ''et al''., p. 378.</ref> Characteristics common to most lichens include obtaining [[organic carbon]] by photosynthesis, slow growth, small size, long life, long-lasting (seasonal) [[Vegetative reproduction|vegetative reproductive]] structures, mineral nutrition obtained largely from airborne sources, and greater tolerance of [[desiccation]] than most other photosynthetic organisms in the same habitat.<ref>Deacon, pp. 267<U+2013>276.</ref>

==== With insects ====
Many insects also engage in [[Ant-fungus mutualism|mutualistic relationships]] with fungi. Several groups of ants cultivate fungi in the order [[Agaricales]] as their primary food source, while [[ambrosia beetles]] cultivate various species of fungi in the bark of trees that they infest.<ref name=Douglas1989/> Similarly, females of several [[wood wasp]] species (genus ''[[Sirex]]'') inject their eggs together with spores of the wood-rotting fungus ''Amylostereum areolatum'' into the [[Wood#Heartwood and sapwood|sapwood]] of [[pine]] trees; the growth of the fungus provides ideal nutritional conditions for the development of the wasp larvae.<ref>Deacon, p. 277.</ref> [[Termites]] on the African [[savannah]] are also known to cultivate fungi,<ref name=Aanen2006/> and yeasts of the genera ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]'' and ''Lachancea'' inhabit the [[Gastrointestinal tract|gut]] of a wide range of insects, including [[neuroptera]]ns, [[beetle]]s, and [[cockroach]]es; it is not known whether these fungi benefit their hosts.<ref name=Nguyen2007/>  The larvae of many families of fungicolous flies, particularly those within the superfamily [[Sciaroidea]] such as the [[Mycetophilidae]] and some [[Keroplatidae]] feed on fungal fruiting bodies and sterile [[mycorrhizae]].<ref name=Chandler2010/>

==== As pathogens and parasites ====
[[File:Aecidium magnellanicum.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A thin brown stick positioned horizontally with roughly two dozen clustered orange-red leaves originating from a single point in the middle of the stick. These orange leaves are three to four times larger than the few other green leaves growing out of the stick, and are covered on the lower leaf surface with hundreds of tiny bumps. The background shows the green leaves and branches of neighboring shrubs.|The plant pathogen ''Aecidium magellanicum'' causes [[calafate rust]], seen here on a ''[[Berberis]]'' shrub in Chile.]]

Many fungi are [[parasite]]s on plants, animals (including humans), and other fungi. Serious pathogens of many cultivated plants causing extensive damage and losses to agriculture and forestry include the [[rice blast]] fungus ''[[Magnaporthe oryzae]]'',<ref name=Talbot2003/> tree pathogens such as ''[[Ophiostoma ulmi]]'' and ''[[Ophiostoma novo-ulmi]]'' causing [[Dutch elm disease]],<ref name=Paoletti2006/> and ''[[Cryphonectria parasitica]]'' responsible for [[chestnut blight]],<ref name=Gryzenhout2006/> and plant pathogens in the genera ''[[Fusarium]]'', ''[[Ustilago]]'', ''[[Alternaria]]'', and ''[[Cochliobolus]]''.<ref name=Paszkowski2006/> Some [[carnivorous fungi]], like ''[[Paecilomyces lilacinus]]'', are [[Nematophagous fungus|predators]] of [[nematodes]], which they capture using an array of specialized structures such as constricting rings or adhesive nets.<ref name=Yang2007/>

Some fungi can cause serious diseases in humans, several of which may be fatal if untreated. These include [[Aspergillosis|aspergilloses]], [[candidosis|candidoses]], [[coccidioidomycosis]], [[cryptococcosis]], [[histoplasmosis]], [[Eumycetoma|mycetomas]], and [[paracoccidioidomycosis]]. Furthermore, persons with [[Immunodeficiency|immuno-deficiencies]] are particularly susceptible to disease by genera such as ''[[Aspergillus]]'', ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]'', ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans|Cryptoccocus]]'',<ref name=Hube2004/><ref name=Nielsen2007/><ref name=Brakhage2005/> ''[[Histoplasma]]'',<ref name=Kauffman2007/> and ''[[Pneumocystis]]''.<ref name=Cushion2007/> Other fungi can attack eyes, nails, hair, and especially skin, the so-called [[Dermatophyte|dermatophytic]] and keratinophilic fungi, and cause local infections such as [[ringworm]] and [[athlete<U+2019>s foot]].<ref name=Cook2008/> Fungal spores are also a cause of [[allergies]], and fungi from different taxonomic groups can evoke allergic reactions.<ref name=SimonNobbe2008/>

==Human use==
[[File:S cerevisiae under DIC microscopy.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Microscopic view of five spherical structures; one of the spheres is considerably smaller than the rest and attached to one of the larger spheres|''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' cells shown with [[Differential interference contrast microscopy|DIC microscopy]]]]
The human use of fungi for food preparation or preservation and other purposes is extensive and has a long history. [[Mushroom farming]] and [[mushroom gathering]] are large industries in many countries. The study of the historical uses and sociological impact of fungi is known as [[ethnomycology]]. Because of the capacity of this group to produce an enormous range of [[natural products]] with [[antimicrobial]] or other biological activities, many species have long been used or are being developed for industrial [[production of antibiotics]], vitamins, and [[Taxol#Production|anti-cancer]] and [[Lovastatin|cholesterol-lowering]] drugs. More recently, methods have been developed for [[genetic engineering]] of fungi,<ref name=Finsham1989/> enabling [[metabolic engineering]] of fungal species. For example, genetic modification of yeast species<ref name=Hawkins2008/><U+2014>which are easy to grow at fast rates in large fermentation vessels<U+2014>has opened up ways of [[pharmaceutical]] production that are potentially more efficient than production by the original source organisms.<ref name=Huang2008/>

=== Drugs ===
Many species produce metabolites that are major sources of [[pharmacology|pharmacologically]] active drugs. Particularly important are the antibiotics, including the [[penicillin]]s, a structurally related group of [[<U+03B2>-lactam antibiotic]]s that are synthesized from small [[peptide]]s. Although naturally occurring penicillins such as [[penicillin G]] (produced by ''[[Penicillium chrysogenum]]'') have a relatively narrow spectrum of biological activity, a wide range of other penicillins can be produced by [[Chemical synthesis|chemical modification]] of the natural penicillins. Modern penicillins are [[semisynthesis|semisynthetic]] compounds, obtained initially from [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] cultures, but then structurally altered for specific desirable properties.<ref name=Brakhage2004/> Other antibiotics produced by fungi include: [[ciclosporin]], commonly used as an [[immunosuppressant]] during [[organ transplant|transplant surgery]]; and [[fusidic acid]], used to help control infection from [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] bacteria.<ref name=Pan2008/> Widespread use of these antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial diseases, such as [[tuberculosis]], [[syphilis]], [[leprosy]], and many others began in the early 20th century and continues to play a major part in [[Antiseptic|anti-bacterial]] [[chemotherapy]]. In nature, antibiotics of fungal or bacterial origin appear to play a dual role: at high concentrations they act as chemical defense against competition with other microorganisms in species-rich environments, such as the [[rhizosphere (ecology)|rhizosphere]], and at low concentrations as [[quorum sensing|quorum-sensing]] molecules for intra- or interspecies signaling.<ref name=Fajardo2008/>

Other drugs produced by fungi include [[griseofulvin]] isolated from ''[[Penicillium griseofulvum]]'', used to treat fungal infections,<ref name=Loo2006/> and [[statin]]s ([[HMG-CoA reductase]] inhibitors), used to inhibit [[cholesterol synthesis]]. Examples of statins found in fungi include [[mevastatin]] from ''Penicillium citrinum'' and [[lovastatin]] from ''[[Aspergillus terreus]]'' and the [[Pleurotus ostreatus|oyster mushroom]].<ref name=Manzoni2002/>

=== Cultured foods ===
[[Baker's yeast]] or ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', a single-celled fungus, is used to make [[bread]] and other wheat-based products, such as [[pizza]] dough and [[dumpling]]s.<ref name=Kulp2000/> Yeast species of the genus ''[[Saccharomyces]]'' are also used to produce [[alcoholic beverage]]s through fermentation.<ref name=Piskur2006/> Shoyu koji mold (''[[Aspergillus oryzae]]'') is an essential ingredient in brewing [[Shoyu]] ([[soy sauce]]) and [[sake]], and the preparation of [[miso]],<ref name=Abe2006/> while ''[[Rhizopus]]'' species are used for making [[tempeh]].<ref name=Hachmeister1993/> Several of these fungi are [[Domestication|domesticated]] species that were [[Breeding program|bred]] or selected according to their capacity to ferment food without producing harmful mycotoxins (see below), which are produced by very closely related ''[[Aspergillus flavus|Aspergilli]]''.<ref name=Jorgensen2007/> [[Quorn]], a [[Meat analogue|meat substitute]], is made from ''[[Fusarium venenatum]]''.<ref name=ODonnell1998/>

===Medicinal use===

The grayish fungus is roughly equal to or slightly greater in length than the caterpillar, and tapers in thickness to a narrow end.}}

Certain mushrooms enjoy usage as therapeutics in [[folk medicine]]s, such as [[Traditional Chinese medicine]]. Notable medicinal mushrooms with a well-documented history of use include ''[[Agaricus subrufescens]]'',<ref name=Hetland2008/><ref name=Firenzuoli2008/> ''[[Ganoderma lucidum]]'',<ref name=Paterson2006/> and ''[[Ophiocordyceps sinensis]]''.<ref name=Paterson2008/> Research has identified compounds produced by these and other fungi that have inhibitory biological effects against [[virus]]es<ref name=elMekkawy1998/><ref name=ElDine2008/> and [[cancer cells]].<ref name=<ref name=Hetland2008/><ref name=Yuen2005/> Specific metabolites, such as [[polysaccharide-K]], [[ergotamine]], and [[Beta-lactam antibiotic|<U+03B2>-lactam antibiotics]], are routinely used in clinical medicine. The [[shiitake]] mushroom is a source of [[lentinan]], a clinical drug approved for use in cancer treatments in several countries, including [[Japan]].<ref name=Sullivan2006/><ref name=Halpern2002/> In [[Europe]] and [[Japan]], [[polysaccharide-K]] (brand name Krestin), a chemical derived from ''[[Trametes versicolor]]'', is an approved [[adjuvant]] for cancer therapy.<ref name=Fisher2002/>

=== Edible and poisonous species ===
[[File:Amanita phalloides 1.JPG|right|thumb|alt=Two light yellow-green mushrooms with stems and caps, one smaller and still in the ground, the larger one pulled out and laid beside the other to show its bulbous stem with a ring|''[[Amanita phalloides]]'' accounts for the majority of fatal [[mushroom poisoning]]s worldwide.]]
[[Edible mushroom]]s are well-known examples of fungi. Many are commercially raised, but others must be harvested from the wild. ''[[Agaricus bisporus]]'', sold as button mushrooms when small or Portobello mushrooms when larger, is a commonly eaten species, used in salads, soups, and many other dishes. Many Asian fungi are commercially grown and have increased in popularity in the West. They are often available fresh in [[grocery store]]s and markets, including straw mushrooms (''[[Volvariella volvacea]]''), oyster mushrooms (''[[Pleurotus ostreatus]]''), shiitakes (''[[Lentinula edodes]]''), and [[enokitake]] (''[[Flammulina]]'' spp.).<ref name=Stamets2000/>

There are many more mushroom species that are [[Mushroom hunting|harvested from the wild]] for personal consumption or commercial sale. [[Lactarius deliciosus|Milk mushrooms]], [[morel]]s, [[chanterelle]]s, [[Truffle (fungi)|truffles]], [[Craterellus|black trumpets]], and ''porcini'' mushrooms (''[[Boletus edulis]]'') (also known as king boletes) demand a high price on the market. They are often used in gourmet dishes.<ref>Hall, pp. 13<U+2013>26.</ref>

Certain types of cheeses require inoculation of milk curds with fungal species that impart a unique flavor and texture to the cheese. Examples include the [[blue cheese|blue]] color in cheeses such as [[Stilton cheese|Stilton]] or [[Roquefort]], which are made by inoculation with ''[[Penicillium roqueforti]]''.<ref name=Kinsella1976/> Molds used in cheese production are non-toxic and are thus safe for human consumption; however, mycotoxins (e.g., aflatoxins, [[roquefortine C]], patulin, or others) may accumulate because of growth of other fungi during cheese ripening or storage.<ref name=Erdogan2004/>
[[File:Blue Stilton Quarter Front.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A corner of cheese with greenish streaks through it|[[Stilton cheese]] veined with ''[[Penicillium roqueforti]]'']]
Many mushroom species are [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] to humans, with toxicities ranging from slight digestive problems or [[allergy|allergic]] reactions as well as [[hallucination]]s to severe organ failures and death. Genera with mushrooms containing deadly toxins include ''[[Conocybe]]'', ''[[Galerina]]'', ''[[Lepiota]]'', and most infamously, ''[[Amanita]]''.<ref name=Orr1979/> The latter genus includes the destroying angel ''([[Amanita virosa|A.&nbsp;virosa]])'' and the death cap ''([[Amanita phalloides|A.&nbsp;phalloides]])'', the most common cause of deadly mushroom poisoning.<ref name=Vetter1998/> The false morel (''[[Gyromitra esculenta]]'') is occasionally considered a delicacy when cooked, yet can be highly toxic when eaten raw.<ref name=Leathem2007/> ''[[Tricholoma equestre]]'' was considered edible until being implicated in serious poisonings causing [[rhabdomyolysis]].<ref name=KarlsonStiber2003/> [[Amanita muscaria|Fly agaric]] mushrooms (''Amanita muscaria'') also cause occasional non-fatal poisonings, mostly as a result of ingestion for use as a [[recreational drug use|recreational]] drug for its [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic]] properties. Historically, fly agaric was used by different peoples in Europe and Asia and its present usage for religious or [[shamanism|shamanic]] purposes is reported from some ethnic groups such as the [[Koryaks|Koryak people]] of north-eastern [[Siberia]].<ref name=Michelot2003/>

As it is difficult to accurately identify a safe mushroom without proper training and knowledge, it is often advised to assume that a wild mushroom is poisonous and not to consume it.<ref>Hall, p. 7.</ref><ref name=Ammirati1987/>

=== Pest control ===
[[File:Beauveria.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Two dead grasshoppers with a whitish fuzz growing on them|Grasshoppers killed by ''[[Beauveria bassiana]]'']]
In agriculture, fungi may be useful if they actively compete for nutrients and space with [[pathogen]]ic microorganisms such as bacteria or other fungi via the [[competitive exclusion principle]],<ref name=LopezGomez2006/> or if they are [[parasitism|parasites]] of these pathogens. For example, certain species may be used to eliminate or suppress the growth of harmful plant pathogens, such as insects, [[mites]], [[weed]]s, [[nematodes]] and other fungi that cause diseases of important [[crop]] plants.<ref name="urlUSDA Biocontrol"/> This has generated strong interest in practical applications that use these fungi in the [[biological control]] of these agricultural pests. [[Entomopathogenic fungi]] can be used as [[biopesticides]], as they actively kill insects.<ref name="urlwww.uvminnovations.com"/> Examples that have been used as [[biological insecticide]]s are ''[[Beauveria bassiana]]'', ''[[Metarhizium]]'' spp, ''[[Hirsutella]]'' spp, ''[[Paecilomyces]]'' (''Isaria'') spp, and ''[[Lecanicillium lecanii]]''.<ref name=Deshpande1999/><ref name=Thomas2007/> [[Endophytic]] fungi of grasses of the genus ''[[Neotyphodium]]'', such as ''[[Neotyphodium coenophialum|N. coenophialum]]'', produce alkaloids that are toxic to a range of invertebrate and vertebrate [[herbivores]]. These alkaloids protect grass plants from [[herbivory]], but several endophyte alkaloids can poison grazing animals, such as cattle and sheep.<ref name=Bush1997/> Infecting cultivars of [[pasture]] or [[forage]] grasses with ''Neotyphodium'' endophytes is one approach being used in [[plant breeding|grass breeding]] programs; the fungal strains are selected for producing only alkaloids that increase resistance to herbivores such as insects, while being non-toxic to livestock.<ref name=Bouton2002/>

=== Bioremediation ===
{{See also|Mycoremediation}}
Certain fungi, in particular "white rot" fungi, can degrade [[insecticide]]s, [[herbicide]]s, [[pentachlorophenol]], [[creosote]], [[coal tar]]s, and heavy fuels and turn them into [[carbon dioxide]], water, and basic elements.<ref name=Christian2005/> Fungi have been shown to [[biomineralization|biomineralize]] [[uranium]] [[oxide]]s, suggesting they may have application in the bioremediation of radioactively polluted sites.<ref name=BBC2008/><ref name=Fomina2007/><ref name=Fomina2008/>

=== Model organisms ===
Several pivotal discoveries in biology were made by researchers using fungi as [[model organisms]], that is, fungi that grow and sexually reproduce rapidly in the laboratory. For example, the [[one gene-one enzyme hypothesis]] was formulated by scientists who used the bread mold ''[[Neurospora crassa]]'' to test their biochemical theories.<ref name=Beadle1941/> Other important model fungi are ''[[Aspergillus nidulans]]'' and the yeasts, ''Saccaromyces cerevisiae'' and ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]'', each of which has a long history of use to investigate issues in eukaryotic [[cell biology]] and [[genetics]], such as [[cell cycle]] regulation, [[chromatin]] structure, and [[gene regulation]]. Other fungal models have more recently emerged that each address specific biological questions relevant to [[medicine]], [[plant pathology]], and industrial uses; examples include ''[[Candida albicans]]'', a dimorphic, opportunistic human pathogen,<ref name=Datta1989/> ''[[Magnaporthe grisea]]'', a plant pathogen,<ref name=Dean2005/> and ''[[Pichia pastoris]]'', a yeast widely used for eukaryotic [[protein expression]].<ref name=Daly2005/>

=== Others ===
Fungi are used extensively to produce industrial chemicals like [[citric acid|citric]], [[gluconic acid|gluconic]], [[lactic acid|lactic]], and [[malic acid|malic]] acids,<ref name=Schlegel1993/> and industrial enzymes, such as [[lipase]]s used in [[biological detergent]]s,<ref name=Joseph2008/> [[cellulase]]s used in making [[cellulosic ethanol]]<ref name=Kumar2008/> and [[stonewashed jeans]],<ref name=nysaes/> and [[amylase]]s,<ref name=OlempskaBeer2006/> [[invertase]]s, [[protease]]s and [[xylanase]]s.<ref name=Polizeli2005/> Several species, most notably ''[[Psilocybin mushroom]]s'' (colloquially known as ''magic mushrooms''), are ingested for their [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] properties, both [[recreational drug|recreationally]] and religiously.

== Mycotoxins ==
[[File:Ergotamine3.png|thumb|right|alt=(6aR,9R)-N-((2R,5S,10aS,10bS)-5-benzyl-10b-hydroxy-2-methyl-3,6-dioxooctahydro-2H-oxazolo[3,2-a] pyrrolo[2,1-c]pyrazin-2-yl)-7-methyl-4,6,6a,7,8,9-hexahydroindolo[4,3-fg] quinoline-9-carboxamide|[[Ergotamine]], a major mycotoxin produced by ''[[Claviceps]]'' species, which if ingested can cause [[gangrene]], convulsions, and [[hallucination]]s]]
Many fungi produce [[biological activity|biologically active]] compounds, several of which are [[toxin|toxic]] to animals or plants and are therefore called [[mycotoxins]]. Of particular relevance to humans are mycotoxins produced by molds causing food spoilage, and poisonous mushrooms (see above). Particularly infamous are the lethal [[amatoxin]]s in some ''[[Amanita]]'' mushrooms, and [[Ergotamine|ergot alkaloid]]s, which have a long history of causing serious epidemics of [[ergotism]] (St Anthony's Fire) in people consuming [[rye]] or related [[cereal]]s contaminated with [[sclerotia]] of the ergot fungus, ''[[Claviceps purpurea]]''.<ref name=Schardl2007/> Other notable mycotoxins include the [[aflatoxin]]s, which are insidious [[Hepatotoxicity|liver toxins]] and highly [[carcinogenic]] metabolites produced by certain ''[[Aspergillus]]'' species often growing in or on grains and nuts consumed by humans, [[ochratoxin]]s, [[patulin]], and [[trichothecene]]s (e.g., [[T-2 mycotoxin]]) and [[fumonisin]]s, which have significant impact on human food supplies or animal [[livestock]].<ref name=vanEgmond2007/>

Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites (or [[natural product]]s), and research has established the existence of biochemical pathways solely for the purpose of producing mycotoxins and other natural products in fungi.<ref name=Keller2005/> Mycotoxins may provide [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] benefits in terms of physiological adaptation, competition with other microbes and fungi, and protection from consumption ([[fungivore|fungivory]]).<ref name=Demain2000/><ref name=Rohlfs2007/>

== Mycology ==
[[Mycology]] is the branch of [[biology]] concerned with the systematic study of fungi, including their genetic and biochemical properties, their taxonomy, and their use to humans as a source of medicine, food, and [[entheogen|psychotropic substances]] consumed for religious purposes, as well as their dangers, such as poisoning or infection. The field of [[phytopathology]], the study of plant diseases, is closely related because many plant pathogens are fungi.<ref name=Struck2006/>
[[File:Pier Antonio Micheli.jpg|thumb|140px|In 1729, Pier A. Micheli first published descriptions of fungi.]]
The use of fungi by humans dates back to prehistory; [[<U+00D6>tzi the Iceman]], a well-preserved mummy of a 5,300-year-old [[Neolithic]] man found frozen in the Austrian Alps, carried two species of [[polypore]] mushrooms that may have been used as [[tinder]] (''[[Fomes fomentarius]]''), or for medicinal purposes (''[[Piptoporus betulinus]]'').<ref name=Peintner1998/> Ancient peoples have used fungi as food sources<U+2013>often unknowingly<U+2013>for millennia, in the preparation of leavened bread and fermented juices. Some of the oldest written records contain references to the destruction of crops that were probably caused by pathogenic fungi.<ref>Ainsworth, p. 1.</ref>

=== History ===
Mycology is a relatively new science that became systematic after the development of the [[microscope]] in the 16th century. Although fungal spores were first observed by [[Giambattista della Porta]] in 1588, the seminal work in the development of mycology is considered to be the publication of [[Pier Antonio Micheli]]'s 1729 work ''Nova plantarum genera''.<ref>Alexopoulos ''et al''., pp. 1<U+2013>2.</ref> Micheli not only observed spores, but showed that under the proper conditions, they could be induced into growing into the same species of fungi from which they originated.<ref>Ainsworth, p. 18.</ref> Extending the use of the [[binomial system]] of nomenclature introduced by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his ''[[Species plantarum]]'' (1753), the Dutch [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] (1761<U+2013>1836) established the first classification of mushrooms with such skill so as to be considered a founder of modern mycology. Later, [[Elias Magnus Fries]] (1794<U+2013>1878) further elaborated the [[Biological classification|classification]] of fungi, using spore color and various microscopic characteristics, methods still used by taxonomists today. Other notable early contributors to mycology in the 17th<U+2013>19th and early 20th centuries include [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]], [[August Carl Joseph Corda]], [[Anton de Bary]], the brothers [[Louis Ren<U+00E9> Tulasne|Louis Ren<U+00E9>]] and [[Charles Tulasne]], [[Arthur Henry Reginald Buller|Arthur H. R. Buller]], [[Curtis Gates Lloyd|Curtis G. Lloyd]], and [[Pier Andrea Saccardo]]. The 20th century has seen a modernization of mycology that has come from advances in [[biochemistry]], [[genetics]], [[molecular biology]], and [[biotechnology]]. The use of [[DNA sequencing]] technologies and phylogenetic analysis has provided new insights into fungal relationships and [[biodiversity]], and has challenged traditional morphology-based groupings in fungal [[taxonomy]].<ref name=Hawksworth2006/>
