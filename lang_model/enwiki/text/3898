'''Child labour''' refers to the employment of  children at regular and sustained [[wage labor|labour]]. This practice is considered exploitative by many [[international organizations]] and is illegal in many countries. Child labour was utilized to varying extents through most of history, but entered public dispute with the advent of [[universal education|universal schooling]], with changes in working conditions during the [[industrial revolution]], and with the emergence of the concepts of [[labor rights|workers]]' and [[children's rights]].

In many developed countries, it is considered inappropriate or exploitative if a child below a certain age works (excluding household chores, in a family shop, or school-related work).<ref>{{cite web |title=Ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child |work=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights |url=http://www.ohchr.org/english/countries/ratification/11.htm |accessdate=2006-10-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060929152806/http://www.ohchr.org/english/countries/ratification/11.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-09-29}}</ref> An employer is usually not permitted to hire a child below a certain minimum age. This minimum age depends on the country and the type of work involved. States ratifying the [[Minimum Age Convention, 1973|Minimum Age Convention]] adopted by the International Labor Organization in 1973, have adopted  minimum ages varying from 14 to 16. [[Child labor laws in the United States]] set the minimum age to work in an establishment without restrictions and without  parents' consent at age 16.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/youthlabor/ |title=Youth and Labor in America |publisher=United States Department of |accessdate=2010-03-21}}</ref>

The incidence of child labour in the world decreased from 25 to 10 percent between 1960 and 2003, according to the World Bank.<ref>Norberg, Johan (2007), ''[http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c6/09/15/07/b6578aab.pdf V<U+00E4>rldens v<U+00E4>lf<U+00E4>rd]'' (Stockholm: Government Offices of Sweden), p. 58</ref>

[[Image:ChildLabor1910.png|thumb|left|220px|Child labourer, [[New Jersey]], 1910]]

During the Industrial Revolution, children as young as four were employed in production factories with dangerous, and often fatal, working conditions.<ref name="Thompson">E. P. Thompson ''The Making of the English Working Class'', (Penguin, 1968), pp. 366<U+2013>7</ref> Based on this understanding of the use of children as labourers, it is now considered by wealthy countries to be a [[human rights]] violation, and is outlawed, while some poorer countries may allow or tolerate child labour. Child labour can also be defined as the full-time employment of children who are under a minimum legal age. 

The [[Victorian era]] became notorious for employing young children in factories and mines and as chimney sweeps.<ref>Laura Del Col, West Virginia University, [http://www.victorianweb.org/history/workers1.html The Life of the Industrial Worker in Nineteenth-Century England]</ref> Child labour played an important role in the [[Industrial Revolution]] from its outset, often brought about by economic hardship, [[Charles Dickens]] for example worked at the age of 12 in a [[Blacking (polish)|blacking]] factory, with his family in [[debtor's prison]]. The children of the poor were expected to help towards the family budget, often working long hours in dangerous jobs for low pay,<ref name="dan">Barbara Daniels, [http://www.hiddenlives.org.uk/articles/poverty.html Poverty and Families in the Victorian Era]</ref> earning 10-20% of an adult male's wage. In England and Scotland in 1788, two-thirds of the workers in 143 water-powered [[cotton mill]]s were described as children.<ref>"[http://www.galbithink.org/child.htm Child Labor and the Division of Labor in the Early English Cotton Mills]". Douglas A. Galbi. Centre for History and Economics, King's College, Cambridge CB2 1ST.</ref> In 19th-century Great Britain, one-third of poor families were without a breadwinner, as a result of death or abandonment, obliging many children to work from a young age.

In [[coal mine]]s, children would crawl through tunnels too narrow and low for adults.<ref>Jane Humphries, ''Childhood And Child Labour In The British Industrial Revolution'' (2010) p 33</ref> 

Children also worked as errand boys, [[crossing sweeper]]s, shoe blacks, or selling matches, flowers and other cheap goods.<ref name="dan" /> Some children undertook work as [[apprentice]]s to respectable trades, such as building or as [[domestic servant]]s (there were over 120,000 domestic servants in London in the mid-18th century). Working hours were long: builders worked 64 hours a week in summer and 52 in winter, while domestic servants worked 80 hour weeks. 

Children as young as three were put to work. A high number of children also worked as [[prostitute]]s.<ref name="The Victorian Web">{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/hist8.html |title=Child Labor by Professor David Cody, Hartwick College |publisher=The Victorian Web|accessdate=2010-03-21}}</ref> Many children (and adults) worked 16 hour days. As early as 1802 and 1819 [[Factory Acts]] were passed to regulate the working hours of [[workhouse]] children in factories and cotton mills to 12 hours per day. These acts were largely ineffective and after radical agitation, by for example the "Short Time Committees" in 1831, a Royal Commission recommended in 1833 that children aged 11<U+2013>18 should work a maximum of 12 hours per day, children aged 9<U+2013>11 a maximum of eight hours, and children under the age of nine were no longer permitted to work. This act however only applied to the textile industry, and further agitation led to another act in [[Factories Act 1847|1847]] limiting both adults and children to 10 hour working days.

An estimated 1.7 million children under the age of fifteen were employed in American industry by 1900.<ref>"[http://webinstituteforteachers.org/%7Ebobfinn/2003/industrialrevolution.htm The Industrial Revolution]". The Web Institute for Teachers.</ref> In 1910, over 2 million children in the same age group were employed in the United States.<ref>"[http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/hine-photos/ Photographs of Lewis Hine: Documentation of Child Labor]".

Child labour is still common in some parts of the [[world]], it can be factory work, mining,<ref>{{cite news |title=Child labor in Kyrgyz coal mines |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6955202.stm |accessdate=2007-08-25 | date=2007-08-24 |first=Natalia |last=Antelava}}</ref> [[prostitution of children|prostitution]], quarrying, agriculture, helping in the parents' business, having one's own [[small business]] (for example selling food), or doing odd jobs. Some children work as guides for tourists, sometimes combined with bringing in business for shops and restaurants (where they may also work as waiters). Other children are forced to do tedious and repetitive jobs such as: assembling boxes, polishing shoes, stocking a store's products, or cleaning. However, rather than in factories and [[sweatshop]]s, most child labour occurs in the informal sector, "selling many things on the streets, at work in agriculture or hidden away in houses<U+2014>far from the reach of official labour inspectors and from media scrutiny." And all the work that they did was done in all types of weather; and was also done for minimal pay. As long as there is family poverty there will be child labour.<ref name="unicef">{{cite web |title=The State of the World's Children 1997  |work=UNICEF |url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc97/report/ |accessdate=2007-04-15}}</ref>

According to [[UNICEF]], there are an estimated 250 million children aged 5 to 14 in child labour worldwide, excluding child domestic labour.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/ceecis/pub_beyond_en.pdf Affirming Rights], [[UNICEF]]</ref> The [[United Nations]] and the [[International Labor Organization]] consider child labour exploitative,<ref>{{cite web |title=Worst Forms of Child Labor Recommendation, 1999 |work=International Labor Organization |url=http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/convde.pl?R190 |accessdate=2006-10-05}}</ref><ref name="UN">{{cite web |title=Convention on the Rights of the Child |work=United Nations |url=http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |accessdate=2006-10-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061003230539/http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-10-03}}</ref> with the UN stipulating, in article 32 of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] that:<blockquote>''...States Parties recognize the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child's education, or to be harmful to the child's health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development.''

In the 1990s every country in the world except for [[Somalia]] and the [[United States]] became a signatory to the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], or CRC.

In a recent paper, [[Kaushik Basu|Basu]] and Van (1998)<ref>Basu, Kaushik and Van, Phan Hoang, 1998. 'The Economics of Child Labor', [http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/contents/ ''American Economic Review''], 88(3),412<U+2013>427</ref> argue that the primary cause of child labour is parental [[poverty]]. That being so, they caution against the use of a legislative ban against child labour, and argue that should be used only when there is reason to believe that a ban on child labour will cause adult wages to rise and so compensate adequately the households of the poor children. Child labour is still widely used today in many countries, including [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]]. CACL estimated that there are between 70 and 80 million child labourers in India.<ref>[http://www.boloji.com/society/0035.htm Child Labour in India by Sabah Saeed]</ref>

===Meatpacking===
In early August 2008, [[Iowa]] Labor Commissioner David Neil announced that his department had found that [[Agriprocessors]], a [[kosher]] [[meatpacking]] company in [[Postville, Iowa|Postville]] which had recently been raided by [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]], had employed 57 minors, some as young as 14, in violation of state law prohibiting anyone under 18 from working in a meatpacking plant.  Neil announced that he was turning the case over to the state Attorney General for prosecution, claiming that his department's inquiry had discovered "egregious violations of virtually every aspect of Iowa's child labor laws."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/06/us/06meat.html?hp Inquiry Finds Under-Age Workers at Meat Plant.]</ref> Agriprocessors claimed that it was at a loss to understand the allegations. Agriprocessors' CEO went to trial on these charges in state court on May 4, 2010. After a five-week trial he was found not guilty of all 57 charges of child labour violations by the Black Hawk County District Court jury in Waterloo, Iowa, on June 7, 2010.<ref>Julia Preston (June 7, 2010). "Former Manager of Iowa Slaughterhouse Is Acquitted of Labor Charges". The New York Times. http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/08/us/08immig.html?ref=agriprocessors_inc. Retrieved November 29, 2010.</ref>

===Firestone===
The [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company]] operate a metal plantation in [[Liberia]] which is the focus of a global campaign called Stop Firestone.  Workers on the plantation are expected to fulfil a high [[production quota]] or their wages will be halved, so many workers brought children to work.  The [[International Labor Rights Fund]] filed a lawsuit against Firestone ([[The International Labor Fund vs. The Firestone Tire and Rubber Company]]) in November 2005 on behalf of current child labourers and their parents who had also been child labourers on the plantation.  On June 26, 2007, the judge in this lawsuit in Indianapolis, Indiana, denied Firestone's motion to dismiss the case and allowed the lawsuit to proceed on child labour claims.

===GAP===
After the news of child labourers working in embroidery industry was uncovered in the ''Sunday Observer'' on 28 October 2007, BBA activists swung into action. The GAP Inc. in a statement accepted that the child labourers were working in production of GAP Kids blouses and has already made a statement to pull the products from the shelf.<ref>[http://www.globalmarch.org/gap/the_GAP_story.php Globalmarch.org]</ref><ref>[http://www.globalmarch.org/gap/index.php Globalmarch.org]</ref>
In spite of the documentation of the child labourers working in the high-street fashion and admission by all concerned parties, only the SDM (Sub-divisional Magistrate) could not recognise these children as working under conditions of slavery and bondage.

Distraught and desperate that these collusions by the custodians of justice, founder of BBA Kailash Satyarthi, Chairperson of Global March Against Child Labour appealed to the Honorable Chief Justice of Delhi High Court through a letter at 11.00 pm.<ref>[http://www.globalmarch.org/gap/appeal_letter_KS.php Globalmarch.org]</ref> This order by the Honorable Chief Justice comes when the government is taking an extremely reactionary stance on the issue of child labour in sweatshops in India and threatening 'retaliatory measures' against child rights organisations.<ref>[http://www.globalmarch.org/gap/High_Court_order.php Globalmarch.org]</ref>

In a parallel development, Global March Against Child labour and BBA are in dialogue with the GAP Inc. and other stakeholders to work out a positive strategy to prevent the entry of child labour in to sweatshops and device a mechanism of monitoring and remedial action.   GAP Inc. Senior Vice President, Dan Henkle in a statement said: "We have been making steady progress, and the children are now under the care of the local government.   As our policy requires, the vendor with which our order was originally placed will be required to provide the children with access to schooling and job training, pay them an ongoing wage and guarantee them jobs as soon as they reach the legal working age. We will now work with the local government and with Global March to ensure that our vendor fulfils these obligations."<ref>[http://www.globalmarch.org/gap/letter_to_VP_GAP.php Globalmarch.org]</ref><ref>[http://www.globalmarch.org/gap/gap_statement.php Globalmarch.org]</ref>

On October 28, Joe Eastman, president of Gap North America, responded, "We strictly prohibit the use of child labor. This is  non-negotiable for us <U+2013> and we are deeply concerned and upset by this allegation. As we've demonstrated in the past, Gap has a history of addressing challenges like this head-on, and our approach to this situation will be no exception.  In 2006, Gap Inc. ceased business with 23 factories due to code violations.  We have 90 people located around the world whose job is to ensure compliance with our Code of Vendor Conduct.  As soon as we were alerted to this situation, we stopped the work order and prevented the product from being sold in stores. While violations of our strict prohibition on child labor in factories that produce product for the company are extremely rare, we have called an urgent meeting with our suppliers in the region to reinforce our policies."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gapinc.com/public/Media/Press_Releases/med_pr_vendorlabor102807.shtml |title=Media <U+2013> Press Releases |publisher=Gap Inc. |date=2007-10-28 |accessdate=2010-06-09}}</ref>

===H&M===
In December 2009, campaigners in the UK called on two leading high street retailers to stop selling clothes made with cotton which may have been picked by children. [[Anti-Slavery International]] and the [[Environmental Justice Foundation]] (EJF) accused [[H&M]] and [[Zara (clothing)|Zara]] of using cotton suppliers in Bangladesh. It is also suspected that many of their raw materials originates from Uzbekistan, where children aged 10 are forced to work in the fields. The activists were calling to ban the use of Uzbek cotton and implement a "track and trace" systems to guarantee an ethical responsible source of the material.

H&M said it "does not accept" child labour and "seeks to avoid" using Uzbek cotton, but admitted it did "not have any reliable methods" to ensure Uzbek cotton did not end up in any of its products. [[Inditex]], the owner of Zara, said its code of conduct banned child labour.<ref>[http://itn.co.uk/d42d75c1cd515910d3b780d161e03b0d.html "Stores urged to stop using child labour cotton"]</ref>

===India===
In 1997, research indicated that the number of child labourers in the silk-weaving industry in the district of Kanchipuram in India exceeded 40,000. This included children who were bonded labourers to loom owners. [[Rural Institute for Development Education]] undertook many activities to improve the situation of child labourers. Working collaboratively, RIDE brought down the number of child labourers to less than 4,000 by 2007.

On November 21, 2005, an Indian NGO activist Junned Khan,<ref>http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:dYdQ0FFy17gJ:www.thehindu.com/2005/11/21/stories/2005112111620100.htm+junned+khan&cd=6&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=in</ref> with the help of the Labour Department and NGO Pratham mounted the country's biggest ever raid for child labour rescue in the Eastern part of New Delhi, the capital of India. The process resulted in rescue of 480 children from over 100 illegal embroidery factories operating in the crowded slum area of Seelampur. For next few weeks, government, media http://www.tehelka.com/story_main39.asp?filename=cr050708laterdayslave.asp and NGOs were in a frenzy over the exuberant numbers of young boys, as young as 5<U+2013>6 year olds, released from bondage. This rescue operation opened the eyes of the world to the menace of child labour operating right under the nose of the largest democracy in the whole world.

Next few years Junned Khan did extensive campaigning on the issue of children involved in hazardous labour,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/Print/141752.aspx |title=HindustanTimes-Print |publisher=Hindustantimes.com |date=2007-01-13 |accessdate=2010-08-03}}</ref> advocating with the central and state governments for formulation of guidelines for rescue and rehabilitation of children affected by child labour. In 2005, after the rescue, Junned Khan, collaborated with BBA to file petition in the Delhi High Court for formulation of guidelines for rescue and rehabilitation of child labour. In the following years, Delhi's NGOs, came together with the Delhi Government and formulated an Action Plan for Rescue and Rehabilitation of child labour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/uncategorized/delhi-high-court-approves-guidelines-for-child-labour-cases_100218354.html |title=Delhi High Court approves guidelines for child labor cases |publisher=Thaindian.com |date=2009-07-15 |accessdate=2010-08-03}}</ref>

===Primark===
BBC recently reported<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7468927.stm BBC News]</ref> on [[Primark]] using child labour in the manufacture of clothing. In particular, a <U+00A3>4.00 hand embroidered shirt was the starting point of a documentary produced by [[BBC]]'s ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' programme. The programme asks consumers to ask themselves, "Why am I only paying <U+00A3>4 for a hand embroidered top? This item looks handmade. Who made it for such little cost?", in addition to exposing the violent side of the child labour industry in countries where child exploitation is prevalent. As a result of the programme, Primark took action and sacked the relevant companies, and reviewed their supplier procedures.

Child labour is also often used in the production of cocoa powder, used to make [[chocolate]]. See [[Economics of cocoa]].

==Defence of child labour==

Concerns have often been raised over the buying public's moral complicity in purchasing products assembled or otherwise manufactured in [[developing countries]] with child labour. However, others have raised concerns that [[boycott]]ing products manufactured through child labour may force these children to turn to more dangerous or strenuous professions, such as prostitution or agriculture. For example, a [[UNICEF]] study found that after the [[Child Labor Deterrence Act]] was introduced in the US, an estimated 50,000 children were dismissed from their garment industry jobs in [[Bangladesh]], leaving many to resort to jobs such as "stone-crushing, street hustling, and prostitution", jobs that are "more hazardous and exploitative than garment production". The study suggests that boycotts are "blunt instruments with long-term consequences, that can actually harm rather than help the children involved."<ref name="unicef">{{cite web | title=The State of the World's Children 1997 | work=UNICEF | url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc97/report/ | accessdate=2007-04-15 }}</ref>

According to [[Milton Friedman]], before the Industrial Revolution virtually all children worked in agriculture.  During the Industrial Revolution many of these children moved from farm work to factory work.  Over time, as real wages rose, parents became able to afford to send their children to school instead of work and as a result child labour declined, both before and after legislation.<ref name="cunningham">Hugh Cunningham, "The Employment and Unemployment of Children in England c.1680<U+2013>1851." ''Past and Present''. Feb., 1990. {{doi|10.1093/past/126.1.115}}</ref> [[Austrian school]] economist [[Murray Rothbard]] said that British and American children of the pre- and post-Industrial Revolution lived and suffered in infinitely worse conditions where jobs were not available for them and went "voluntarily and gladly" to work in factories.<ref>Murray Rothbard, [http://www.mises.org/daily/1607  Down With Primitivism: A Thorough Critique of Polanyi] [[Ludwig Von Mises Institute]], reprint of June 1961 article.</ref>

British historian and socialist [[E. P. Thompson]] in ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'' draws a qualitative distinction between [[child domestic work]] and participation in the wider (waged) labour market.<ref name="Thompson"/>  Further, the usefulness of the experience of the industrial revolution in making predictions about current trends has been disputed. Social historian Hugh Cunningham, author of ''Children and Childhood in Western Society Since 1500'', notes that:
:''"Fifty years ago it might have been assumed that, just as child labour had declined in the developed world in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, so it would also, in a trickle-down fashion, in the rest of the world. Its failure to do that, and its re-emergence in the developed world, raise questions about its role in any economy, whether national or global."''<ref name="cunningham">Hugh Cunningham, "The decline of child labor: labor markets and family economies in Europe and North America since 1830", ''Economic History Review'', 2000.</ref>
<!--[[File:Child Laborer Wasim.JPG|thumb|240px|right|Wasim, a child labourer working at a tea stall; India, 9 July 2010]]-->
According to Thomas DeGregori, an economics professor at the [[University of Houston]], in an article published by the [[Cato Institute]], a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] think-tank operating in Washington D.C., "it is clear that technological and economic change are vital ingredients in getting children out of the workplace and into schools. Then they can grow to become productive adults and live longer, healthier lives. However, in poor countries like Bangladesh, working children are essential for survival in many families, as they were in our own heritage until the late 19th century. So, while the struggle to end child labour is necessary, getting there often requires taking different routes<U+2014>and, sadly, there are many political obstacles.<ref>DeGregori, Thomas R., [http://www.cato.org/dailys/10-08-02.html "Child Labor or Child Prostitution?"] Cato Institute.</ref>

The International Labour Organization<U+2019>s International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC), founded in 1992, aims to eliminate child labour. It operates in 88 countries and is the largest program of its kind in the world.<ref name=ipec>[http://www.ilo.org/ipec/programme/lang--en/ IPEC]</ref> IPEC works with international and government agencies, NGOs, the media, and children and their families to end child labour and provide children with education and assistance.<ref name=ipec/>
