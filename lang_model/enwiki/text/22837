{{Antimatter}}

In [[particle physics]], '''antimatter''' is material composed of [[antiparticle]]s, which have the same mass as [[subatomic particle|particle]]s of ordinary matter but have opposite [[electric charge|charge]] and other particle properties such as [[lepton number|lepton]] and [[baryon number]]. Encounters between particles and antiparticles lead to the [[annihilation]] of both, giving rise to varying proportions of high-energy [[photon]]s ([[gamma ray]]s), [[neutrino]]s, and lower-mass particle<U+2013>antiparticle pairs. Setting aside the mass of any product neutrinos, which represent released energy which generally continues to be unavailable, the end result of annihilation is a release of energy available to do work, proportional to the total matter and antimatter mass, in accord with the [[mass-energy equivalence]] equation, ''E''=''mc''<sup>2</sup>.<ref>http://news.discovery.com/space/pamela-spots-a-smidgen-of-antimatter-110811.html</ref>

Antiparticles bind with each other to form antimatter just as ordinary particles bind to form normal matter. For example, a [[positron]] (the antiparticle of the [[electron]]) and an [[antiproton]] can form an [[antihydrogen]] atom. Physical principles indicate that complex antimatter atomic nuclei are possible, as well as anti-atoms corresponding to the known chemical elements. To date, however, anti-atoms more complex than antihelium have neither been artificially produced nor observed in nature. Studies of cosmic rays have identified both positrons and antiprotons, presumably produced by high-energy collisions between particles of ordinary matter.

There is considerable speculation as to why the [[observable universe]] is apparently composed almost entirely of ordinary matter, as opposed to a more symmetric combination of matter and antimatter. This [[baryon asymmetry|asymmetry of matter and antimatter]] in the [[visible universe]] is one of the greatest [[unsolved problems in physics]].<ref>David Tenenbaum, David, [http://www.news.wisc.edu/21376 One step closer: UW-Madison scientists help explain scarcity of anti-matter], University of Wisconsin<U+2014>Madison News, December 26, 2012</ref> The process by which this asymmetry between particles and antiparticles developed is called [[baryogenesis]].

Antimatter in the form of anti-atoms is one of the most difficult materials to produce. Antimatter in the form of individual anti-particles, however, is commonly produced by particle accelerators and in some types of radioactive decay.

==History of the concept==
The idea of [[negative matter]] appears in past theories of matter that have now been abandoned.  Using the once popular [[vortex theory of gravity]], the possibility of matter with negative gravity was discussed by [[William Mitchinson Hicks|William Hicks]] in the 1880s. Between the 1880s and the 1890s, [[Karl Pearson]] proposed the existence of "squirts" (sources) and sinks of the flow of [[Luminiferous aether|aether]]. The squirts represented normal matter and the sinks represented negative matter.  Pearson's theory required a fourth dimension for the aether to flow from and into.<ref>{{cite book| author = H.

The term antimatter was first used by [[Arthur Schuster]] in two rather whimsical letters to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1898,<ref>{{cite journal
 |author=A. Schuster
 |year=1898
 |title=Potential Matter.<U+2014>A Holiday Dream

|bibcode = 1898Natur..58..367S }}</ref> in which he coined the term. He hypothesized [[antiatom]]s, as well as whole antimatter solar systems, and discussed the possibility of matter and antimatter annihilating each other. Schuster's ideas were not a serious theoretical proposal, merely speculation, and like the previous ideas, differed from the modern concept of antimatter in that it possessed [[antigravity|negative gravity]].<ref>{{cite book| author = E.

The modern theory of antimatter began in 1928, with a paper<ref>{{cite journal

Dirac realised that his [[Dirac equation|relativistic version]] of the [[Schr<U+00F6>dinger equation|Schr<U+00F6>dinger wave equation]] for electrons predicted the possibility of [[antielectron]]s. These were discovered by [[Carl David Anderson|Carl D. Anderson]] in 1932 and named [[positron]]s (a contraction of "positive electrons").

==Notation==
One way to denote an antiparticle is by adding a bar over the particle's symbol. For example, the proton and antiproton are denoted as {{Subatomic particle|proton}} and {{Subatomic particle|antiproton}}, respectively. The same rule applies if one were to address a particle by its constituent components. A proton is made up of {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down quark}} [[quark]]s, so an antiproton must therefore be formed from {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down antiquark}} [[antiquark]]s. Another convention is to distinguish particles by their [[electric charge]]. Thus, the electron and positron are denoted simply as {{Subatomic particle|Electron}} and {{Subatomic particle|Positron}} respectively. However, to prevent confusion, the two conventions are never mixed.

==Origin and asymmetry==
{{see also|Baryogenesis}}
Almost all matter observable from the Earth seems to be made of matter rather than antimatter. If antimatter-dominated regions of space existed, the gamma rays produced in annihilation reactions along the boundary between matter and antimatter regions would be detectable.<ref>{{cite journal

Antiparticles are created everywhere in the [[universe]] where high-energy particle collisions take place. High-energy [[cosmic ray]]s impacting [[Earth's atmosphere]] (or any other matter in the [[Solar System]]) produce minute quantities of antiparticles in the resulting [[particle jet]]s, which are immediately annihilated by contact with nearby matter. They may similarly be produced in regions like the [[Galactic Center|center]] of the [[Milky Way]] and other galaxies, where very energetic celestial events occur (principally the interaction of [[relativistic jet]]s with the [[interstellar medium]]). The presence of the resulting antimatter is detectable by the two [[gamma ray]]s produced every time [[positron]]s annihilate with nearby matter. The [[frequency]] and [[wavelength]] of the gamma rays indicate that each carries 511&nbsp;[[electronvolt|keV]] of energy (i.e., the [[rest mass]] of an [[electron]] multiplied by ''[[speed of light|c]]''<sup>2</sup>).

Recent observations by the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[INTEGRAL|INTEGRAL satellite]] may explain the origin of a giant cloud of antimatter surrounding the galactic center. The observations show that the cloud is asymmetrical and matches the pattern of [[X-ray binaries]] (binary star systems containing black holes or neutron stars), mostly on one side of the galactic center. While the mechanism is not fully understood, it is likely to involve the production of electron<U+2013>positron pairs, as ordinary matter gains tremendous energy while falling into a [[stellar remnant]].<ref>{{cite web

Antimatter may exist in relatively large amounts in far-away galaxies due to [[cosmic inflation]] in the primordial time of the universe. Antimatter galaxies, if they exist, are expected to have the same chemistry and [[spectroscopy|absorption and emission spectra]] as normal-matter galaxies, and their [[astronomical object]]s would be observationally identical, making them difficult to distinguish.<ref>{{cite book| last = Close| first = F.

==Natural production==

Positrons are produced naturally in <U+03B2><sup>+</sup> decays of naturally occurring radioactive isotopes (for example, [[potassium-40]]) and in interactions of gamma quanta (emitted by radioactive nuclei) with matter.  [[Antineutrino]]s are another kind of antiparticle created by natural radioactivity (<U+03B2><sup><U+2212></sup> decay). Many different kinds of antiparticles are also produced by (and contained in) [[cosmic rays]]. Recent (as of January 2011) research by the [[American Astronomical Society]] has discovered antimatter (positrons) originating above [[thunderstorm]] clouds; positrons are produced in gamma-ray flashes created by electrons accelerated by strong electric fields in the clouds.<ref>{{cite web

Antiparticles are also produced in any environment with a sufficiently high temperature (mean particle energy greater than the [[pair production]] threshold). During the period of baryogenesis, when the universe was extremely hot and dense, matter and antimatter were continually produced and annihilated. The presence of remaining matter, and absence of detectable remaining antimatter,<ref>{{cite web

The exact mechanism of this violation during baryogenesis remains a mystery.

Positrons can be produced by radioactive [[Beta decay|{{Subatomic particle|beta+}} decay]], but this mechanism can occur both naturally and artificially.

=== Observation in cosmic rays ===
Satellite experiments have found evidence of [[positron]]s and a few antiprotons in primary cosmic rays, amounting to less than 1% of the particles in primary cosmic rays. These do not appear to be the products of large amounts of antimatter from the Big Bang, or indeed complex antimatter in the universe. Rather, they appear to consist of only these two elementary particles, newly made in energetic processes.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Preliminary results from the presently operating [[Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer]] (''AMS-02'') on board the [[International Space Station]] show that positrons in the cosmic rays arrive with no directionality, and with energies that range from 10 [[Wiktionary:gigaelectron volt|GeV]] to 250 GeV, with the fraction of positrons to electrons increasing at higher energies. These results on interpretation have been suggested to be due to positron production in annihilation events of massive [[dark matter]] particles.<ref name="physrevltrs413">{{Cite doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.141102}}</ref>

Antiprotons arrive at Earth with a characteristic energy maximum of 2&nbsp;GeV, indicating their production in a fundamentally different process from cosmic ray protons, which on average have only one-sixth of the energy.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/565/1/280 | title=Secondary antiprotons and propagation of cosmic rays in the Galaxy and heliosphere | author=Moskalenko, I.

There is no evidence of complex antimatter atomic nuclei, such as [[antihelium]] nuclei (i.e., anti-alpha particles), in cosmic rays. These are actively being searched for. A prototype of the ''AMS-02'' designated ''AMS-01'', was flown into space aboard the {{OV|103}} on [[STS-91]] in June 1998. By not detecting any [[Antihelium#Antihelium|antihelium]] at all, the ''AMS-01'' established an upper limit of 1.1<U+00D7>10<sup><U+2212>6</sup> for the antihelium to helium [[flux]] ratio.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Physics Reports |volume=366 |issue=6 |pages=331<U+2013>405 |year=2002 |month=August |author=AMS Collaboration |last2=Aguilar |first2=M. |last3=Alcaraz |first3=J. |last4=Allaby |first4=J. |last5=Alpat |first5=B. |last6=Ambrosi |first6=G. |last7=Anderhub |first7=H. |last8=Ao |first8=L. |last9=Arefiev |first9=A. |title=The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) on the International Space Station: Part I <U+2013> results from the test flight on the space shuttle |bibcode=2002PhR...366..331A |doi=10.1016/S0370-1573(02)00013-3}}</ref>

The existence of the antiproton was experimentally confirmed in 1955 by [[University of California, Berkeley]] [[physicist]]s [[Emilio Segr<U+00E8>]] and [[Owen Chamberlain]], for which they were awarded the 1959 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].<ref>{{cite web

In addition to anti[[baryon]]s, anti-nuclei consisting of multiple bound antiprotons and antineutrons have been created. These are typically produced at energies far too high to form antimatter atoms (with bound positrons in place of electrons). In 1965, a group of researchers led by [[Antonino Zichichi]] reported production of nuclei of antideuterium at the Proton Synchrotron at [[CERN]].<ref>{{Cite journal

===Antihydrogen atoms===
{{Main|Antihydrogen}}
<!-- Should antihelium be folded into this section? I haven't checked to see whether they'd created antihelium nuclei or true antihelium atoms with bound positrons. -->
In 1995, [[CERN]] announced that it had successfully brought into existence nine antihydrogen atoms by implementing the [[SLAC]]/[[Fermilab]] concept during the [[PS210 experiment]]. The experiment was performed using the [[Low Energy Antiproton Ring]] (LEAR), and was led by Walter Oelert and Mario Macri{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}. Fermilab soon confirmed the CERN findings by producing approximately 100 antihydrogen atoms at their facilities. The antihydrogen atoms created during PS210 and subsequent experiments (at both CERN and Fermilab) were extremely energetic ("hot") and were not well suited to study. To resolve this hurdle, and to gain a better understanding of antihydrogen, two collaborations were formed in the late 1990s, namely, [[ATHENA]] and [[ATRAP]]. In 2005, ATHENA disbanded and some of the former members (along with others) formed the  [[ALPHA Collaboration]], which is also based at CERN. The primary goal of these collaborations is the creation of less energetic ("cold") antihydrogen, better suited to study{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}.

In 1999, CERN activated the [[Antiproton Decelerator]], a device capable of decelerating antiprotons from {{val|3.5|ul=GeV}} to {{val|5.3|ul=MeV}} <U+2014> still too "hot" to produce study-effective antihydrogen, but a huge leap forward. In late 2002 the ATHENA project announced that they had created the world's first "cold" antihydrogen.<ref>{{cite journal

The antiprotons are still hot when initially trapped.  To cool them further, they are mixed into an electron plasma.  The electrons in this plasma cool via cyclotron radiation, and then sympathetically cool the antiprotons via [[Coulomb potential|Coulomb]] collisions.

Manipulations of the trap electrodes then tip the antiprotons into the positron plasma, where some combine with antiprotons to form antihydrogen.  This neutral antihydrogen is unaffected by the electric and magnetic fields used to trap the charged positrons and antiprotons, and within a few microseconds the antihydrogen hits the trap walls, where it annihilates.  Some hundreds of millions of antihydrogen atoms have been made in this fashion.

Most of the sought-after high-precision tests of the properties of antihydrogen could only be performed if the antihydrogen were trapped, that is, held in place for a relatively long time.   While antihydrogen atoms are electrically neutral, the [[spin (physics)|spin]]s of their component particles produce a [[magnetic moment]]. These magnetic moments can interact with an inhomogeneous magnetic field; some of the antihydrogen atoms can be attracted to a magnetic minimum.  Such a minimum can be created by a combination of mirror and multipole fields.<ref>{{cite journal

===Preservation===
<!--===Antimatter trap===!-->
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2009}}
Antimatter cannot be stored in a container made of ordinary matter because antimatter reacts with any matter it touches, annihilating itself and an equal amount of the container. Antimatter in the form of [[charged particle]]s can be contained by a combination of [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field|magnetic]] fields, in a device called a [[Penning trap]]. This device cannot, however, contain antimatter that consists of uncharged particles, for which [[atomic trap]]s are used. In particular, such a trap may use the [[dipole]] moment ([[Electric dipole moment|electric]] or [[Magnetic moment|magnetic]]) of the trapped particles. At high [[vacuum]], the matter or antimatter particles can be trapped and cooled with slightly off-resonant laser radiation using a [[magneto-optical trap]] or [[Magnetic trap (atoms)|magnetic trap]]. Small particles can also be suspended with [[optical tweezers]], using a highly focused laser beam.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Uses==

===Medical===
Matter-antimatter reactions have practical applications in medical imaging, such as [[positron emission tomography]] (PET). In positive [[beta decay]], a [[nuclide]] loses surplus positive charge by emitting a positron (in the same event, a proton becomes a neutron, and a [[neutrino]] is also emitted). Nuclides with surplus positive charge are easily made in a [[cyclotron]] and are widely generated for medical use. Antiprotons have also been shown within laboratory experiments to have the potential to treat certain cancers, in a similar method currently used for ion (proton) therapy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engr.psu.edu/antimatter/Papers/pbar_med.pdf|title=Antiproton portable traps and medical applications}}</ref>

Since the energy density of antimatter is higher than that of conventional fuels, an antimatter-fueled spacecraft would have a higher thrust-to-weight ratio than a conventional spacecraft.

If matter-antimatter collisions resulted only in [[photon]] emission, the entire [[rest mass]] of the particles would be converted to [[kinetic energy]]. The [[energy density|energy per unit mass]] ({{val|9|e=16|u=J/kg}}) is about 10 [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] greater than [[chemical energy|chemical energies]],<ref>(compared to the [[heat of formation|formation]] of [[water]] at {{val|1.56|e=7|u=J/kg}}, for example)</ref> and about 3 orders of magnitude greater than the [[nuclear potential energy]] that can be liberated, today, using [[nuclear fission]] (about {{val|200|u=MeV}} per fission reaction<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> or {{val|8|e=13|u=J/kg}}), and about 2 orders of magnitude greater than the best possible results expected from [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] (about {{val|6.3|e=14|u=J/kg}} for the [[proton-proton chain reaction|proton-proton chain]]). The reaction of {{val|1|ul=kg}} of antimatter with {{val|1|u=kg}} of matter would produce {{val|1.8|e=17|ul=J}} (180 petajoules) of energy (by the [[mass-energy equivalence]] formula, ''E = mc<sup>2</sup>''), or the rough equivalent of 43 megatons of TNT <U+2013> slightly less than the yield of the 27,000&nbsp;kg [[Tsar Bomb]], the largest [[thermonuclear weapon]] ever detonated.

Not all of that energy can be utilized by any realistic propulsion technology because of the nature of the annihilation products. While electron-positron reactions result in gamma ray photons, these are difficult to direct and use for thrust. In reactions between protons and antiprotons, their energy is converted largely into relativistic neutral and charged [[pion]]s. The [[Pion#Neutral pion decays|neutral pions]] decay almost immediately (with a half-life of 84 [[attoseconds]]) into high-energy photons, but the [[Pion#Charged pion decays|charged pions]] decay more slowly (with a half-life of 26 nanoseconds) and can be [[Antimatter rocket#Direct use of reaction products|deflected magnetically to produce thrust]].

Note that charged pions ultimately decay into a combination of [[neutrino]]s (carrying about 22% of the energy of the charged pions) and unstable charged [[muon]]s (carrying about 78% of the charged pion energy), with the muons then decaying into a combination of electrons, positrons and neutrinos (cf. [[muon decay]]; the neutrinos from this decay carry about 2/3 of the energy of the muons, meaning that from the original charged pions, the total fraction of their energy converted to neutrinos by one route or another would be about 0.22 + (2/3)*0.78 = 0.74).<ref>{{cite web

For more regular (earthly) applications (e.g., regular transport, use in portable generators, powering of cities, ...) artificially created antimatter is not a suitable energy carrier, despite its high energy density, because the process of creating antimatter is extremely inefficient.

Some researchers{{Who|date=May 2012}} claim that with current technology, it is possible to obtain antimatter for [[United States dollar|US$]]25 million per gram by optimizing the collision and collection parameters (given current electricity generation costs).{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
Many experts{{Who|date=March 2011}}, however, dispute these claims as being far too optimistic by many orders of magnitude. They point out that, in 2004, the annual production of antiprotons at [[CERN]] was several picograms at a cost of $20 million. This means that to produce 1&nbsp;gram of antimatter, [[CERN]] would need to spend 100 quadrillion ({{val|e=17}}) dollars and run the antimatter factory for 100 billion years.

Antimatter production costs, in mass production, are almost linearly tied to electricity costs, so economical pure-antimatter thrust applications are unlikely to come online unless a very cheap power source is found.

Storage is another problem, as antiprotons are negatively charged and repel each other, so that they cannot be concentrated in a small volume (cf. [[space charge]]). [[Plasma oscillation]]s in the charged cloud of antiprotons can cause instabilities that drive antiprotons out of the storage trap. For these reasons, to date, only a few million antiprotons have been stored simultaneously in a magnetic trap, which corresponds to much less than a femtogram. Antihydrogen atoms or molecules are neutral, so in principle they do not suffer from the plasma problems of antiprotons described above. But cold antihydrogen is far more difficult to produce than antiprotons{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}.

One researcher from the CERN laboratories, which produces antimatter regularly, said:
