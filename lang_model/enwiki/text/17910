[[Marine biology|Marine]] mammals include [[dolphin]]s, [[manatee]]s, and [[whale]]s. Of the 349 [[bird]] species, about 120 breed in the archipelago, and 47.5% are accidental or rare.

No native freshwater fish inhabit Puerto Rico, but some species, introduced by humans, have established populations in [[reservoir]]s and [[river]]s. The low richness-high diversity pattern is also apparent among [[invertebrate]]s, which constitute most of the archipelago's fauna.

The arrival of the first people about 4,000 years ago and, to a larger extent, of [[Europe|Europeans]] more than 500 years ago, had a significant effect on Puerto Rico's fauna.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/Hotspots/caribbean/impacts.xml |title= Caribbean - Human impacts|accessdate = 2006-09-19 |date= |year= |month= |format= |work=Biodiversity Hotspots |publisher=Conservation International |pages= |language= |archiveurl=|archivedate=}}</ref> [[Hunting]], [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] destruction, and the introduction of non-native species led to [[extinction]]s and extirpations (local extinctions).

==Origin of Puerto Rican fauna==
[[Image:LocationPuertoRico.png|thumb|right|200px|Geographic location of Puerto Rico]]
The [[Caribbean Plate]], an oceanic [[tectonic plate]] on which Puerto Rico and the [[Antilles]] (with the exception of [[Cuba]]) lie, was formed in the late [[Mesozoic]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Martin Meschede and Wolfgang Frisch |year= |month= |title=The evolution of the Caribbean Plate and its relation to global plate motion vectors: geometric constraints for an inter-American origin |journal=Transactions of the Fifteenth Caribbean Geological Conference |volume= |issue= |pages=1 |id= |url= |accessdate = 2006-09-11 }}</ref> According to Rosen, when [[South America]] separated from [[Africa]], a volcanic archipelago known as "Proto-Antilles" was formed. It later divided into the present-day [[Greater Antilles|Greater]] and [[Lesser Antilles]] because of a new fault line in the "Proto-Antilles".<ref>{{cite journal| author = Rosen, D.E. | year = 1975 | month =  | title = A vicariance model of Caribbean biogeography | journal = Systematic Zoology  | volume = 25 | issue =  | pages = 431-464 | doi = | id =  | url =  | format =  | accessdate = }}</ref> Geologically, the archipelago of Puerto Rico is young, having formed about 135&nbsp;[[Annum|Ma]] (million years) ago. The prevailing hypothesis, proposed by Howard Meyerhoff, posits that the Puerto Rican Bank, consisting of Puerto Rico, its outlying islands, and the [[Virgin Islands]] with the exception of [[Saint Croix, United States Virgin Islands|St. Croix]], was formed from volcanism in the [[Cretaceous|Cretaceous Period]].<ref name="Biogeography">{{Cite journal | author = Heatwole, H., Levins, R., and Byer, M.D. | year = 1981 | month= July| url = http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/faculty/duffy/arb/242-251/251.pdf | title =  Biogeography of the Puerto Rican Bank | journal = Atoll Research Bulletin | issue = 251 | pages = 8| format = pdf |accessdate = 2006-07-30}}</ref> Rock samples from Sierra Bermeja in southwestern Puerto Rico, dated to the late Jurassic/early Cretaceous period, confirm this theory.<ref>{{cite book |author=Edward G.

There is ongoing debate over when and how the ancestors of [[Vertebrate|vertebrate fauna]] colonized the Antilles<U+2014>particularly whether the Proto-Antilles were oceanic islands or whether they once formed a land connection between South and [[North America]]. The first, and prevailing, model favors overwater dispersal from continental, primarily South American, fauna; the other suggests the [[speciation|vicarization]] of proto-Antillean fauna. Hedges et al. conclude that [[Biological dispersal#Dispersal in animals|dispersal]] was "the primary mechanism for the origin of West Indian biota". Vertebrate terrestrial genera such as ''[[Eleutherodactylus]]'' dispersed in a "filter" effect among the islands before any vicarization event occurred. However, other fauna such as the endemic Antillean insectivores (''[[Nesophontes]] sp.'', ''[[Solenodon marcanoi]]'' and others) and freshwater fish appear to have colonized the [[West Indies]] earlier through other means.<ref>{{cite journal| author = S.

MacPhee and Iturralde provide an alternate hypothesis that the initiators of land mammal [[clade]]s arrived on the Proto-Antilles by the mid-[[Tertiary]] period, approximately at the [[Eocene]]<U+2013>[[Oligocene]] boundary.

The last major changes in Puerto Rican fauna occurred about 10,000 years ago as a result of the post-[[Ice Age]] rise in sea level and associated environmental changes.

==Mammals==

The richness of [[mammal]]s in Puerto Rico, like many other islands, is low relative to to mainland regions. The present-day native terrestrial mammal fauna of Puerto Rico is composed of only 13 species, all of which are bats. Eighteen marine mammals, including [[manatee]]s, [[dolphin]]s and [[whale]]s, occur in Puerto Rico.<ref name="Marine">{{cite web|url=http://www.intecmar.usb.ve/CoMLCaribbean/Summaries/summary_puertorico.htm |title=Marine Biodiversity of Puerto Rico: Current Status |accessdate = 2006-08-12|author=Ernesto Weil |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= }}</ref> [[Fossil]] records show the existence of one shrew ([[Puerto Rican shrew]], ''Nesophontes edithae''), one [[sloth]] (Puerto Rican Sloth),<ref>Some authorities recognize two species of sloths occurring in Puerto Rico, the Greater Puerto Rican Sloth (''Acratocnus major'') and the Lesser Puerto Rican Sloth (''Acratocnus odontrigonus'').</ref> three additional [[Phyllostomidae|leaf-nosed bats]] (''[[Macrotus waterhoussii]]'', ''[[Monophyllus plethodon]]'', and ''[[Phyllonycteris major]]'')<ref>Morgan, G.

Other terrestrial mammals have been introduced throughout the history of Puerto Rico. Indigenous settlers first introduced dogs and guinea pigs from South or Central America. Afterwards, [[Ta<U+00ED>no]]s introduced [[hutia]]s as a food source from Hispaniola. When the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] colonized the island in the early 16th century, they introduced domesticated animals such as dogs, cats, goats, pigs, [[cattle]], horses, and [[donkey]]s.<ref name=USGS>{{cite web|url= http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/cr133.htm|title=Caribbean Islands |accessmonthday=July 27 |accessyear=2006 |author=Wiley, James W. and Vilella, Francisco J. |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}</ref> Other species such as [[Black Rat]]s (''Rattus rattus''), [[Norway Rat]]s (''Rattus norvegicus'') and house mice (''Mus sp.'') have been unintentionally introduced as stowaways, possibly since [[Christopher Columbus]]'s arrival in 1493. More recently, species have been introduced as a means of [[biological pest control]]. For example, the Small Asian Mongoose (''Herpestes javanicus'') was introduced in the 19th century to control the damage caused by rats in [[sugar cane]] plantations. The introduction was a failure: the mongoose failed to control the rat population and instead contributed to the decline of native fauna such as the [[Yellow-shouldered Blackbird]] and possibly the [[Elfin-woods Warbler]].

[[Image:Rhesus Macaques 4528.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Rhesus Macaque]]s, an introduced mammal to Puerto Rico]]
As part of a study on [[adaptation]], 57 [[Rhesus Macaque]]s (''Macaca mulatta'') were introduced to the island of [[Desecheo]] and other southern off-shore islands and cays in 1967.<ref name=USGS/> Prior to the introduction, Desecheo was the largest nesting colony of the [[Brown Booby]], but mainly as a result of egg [[predation]] by the introduced macaques, no bird species presently nests in the island. Efforts to trap and remove the species have been unsuccessful and it has expanded its range to southwestern Puerto Rico. Other [[primate]]s also have established populations in Puerto Rico. As a result of vandalism, 107 [[Squirrel monkey]]s escaped from a research station at Sabana Seca in the late 1970s. The latest estimate for this population is 35 individuals.<ref name=USGS/> 

[[Image:Manatee with calf.PD.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[West Indian Manatee]], an aquatic mammal of Puerto Rico]]
Arguably the most famous of aquatic mammals occurring in Puerto Rican waters is the [[West Indian Manatee|Antillean Manatee]] (''Trichechus manatus manatus'') which is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN. The archipelago's waters are one of the species' main breeding areas. Manatees gathered local media attention when a two-month manatee nicknamed Mois<U+00E9>s was rescued and raised for 27 months by the Caribbean Stranding Network (CSN). Mois<U+00E9>s was the first successful release of an orphaned, captive-raised manatee to the marine environment in the Caribbean.<ref>{{cite journal| author = Antonio A.

Puerto Rico's waters are also an important breeding site for the [[Humpback whale]] during the Northern Hemisphere's winter. Humpback [[whale watching]] is a popular tourist attraction in the municipality of [[Rinc<U+00F3>n, Puerto Rico|Rinc<U+00F3>n]] in western Puerto Rico. 

===Bats===
[[Extant taxon|Extant]] bats of Puerto Rico belong to five families ([[Noctilionidae]], [[Mormoopidae]], [[Phyllostomidae]], [[Vespertilionidae]], and [[Molossidae]]) and include a total of 13 species, of which six subspecies are endemic to the archipelago. Seven of the 13 species are [[insectivore]]s, four can be considered [[frugivore]]s, one species feeds on nectar and another on fish. The species total is a relatively low number in comparison to the other Greater Antilles. [[Jamaica]], for example, with an area approximately 1.2 times that of Puerto Rico, has 21 species (1.6 times that of Puerto Rico). A possible explanation for this is the comparatively large distance between the archipelago and the mainland dispersion areas. Jamaica, for example, is closer to Cuba and Hispaniola which are themselves closer to the mainland dispersion areas of North and Central America<!-- Confusing. Please rewrite or clarify. -->. 

Bats play an important role in forest and cave ecology in Puerto Rico and help control mosquito populations. Most species (10 of 13) are cave-dwellers with low reproductive rates; the area with the highest species richness is the [[Caribbean National Forest]], where eleven species occur.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r8/caribbean/wildlife-facts/2002/wildlife-facts-february-2002.shtml |title= Wildlife Facts - February 2002 - Bats|accessmonthday= July 27|accessyear=2006 |author=Cuevas, Victor M.|date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}</ref> The Red Fig-eating Bat, endemic to the Puerto Rican Bank, plays an important role in the ecology of tabonuco<ref>Tabonuco or ''Dacryodes excelsa''.</ref> forest in the Luquillo Mountains since it is believed to be the only seed disperser of bulletwood (''Manilkara bidentata''). Cave ecosystems are enhanced by bat feces ([[guano]]) since many of the invertebrate cave fauna are either guano scavengers, [[detrivore]]s or predators of the former two.

The bat species that occur in the archipelago of Puerto Rico are:  [[Greater Bulldog Bat]] (''Noctilio leporinus''), [[Antillean Ghost-faced Bat]] (''Mormoops blainvillii''), [[Parnell's Mustached Bat]] (''Pteronotus parnellii''), [[Sooty Mustached Bat]] (''Pteronotus quadridens''), [[Jamaican Fruit Bat]] (''Artibeus jamaicensis''), [[Antillean Fruit Bat]] (''Brachyphylla cavernarum''), [[Brown Flower Bat]] (''Erophylla sezekoni bombifrons''), [[Greater Antillean Long-tongued Bat]] (''Monophyllus redmani''), [[Red Fig-eating Bat]] (''Stenoderma rufum''), [[Big Brown Bat]] (''Eptesicus fuscus''), [[Red Bat]] (''Lasiurus borealis''), [[Velvety Free-tailed Bat]] (''Molossus molossus''), and [[Brazilian Free-tailed Bat]] (''Tadarida brasiliensis'').

The [[List of Puerto Rican birds|avifauna of Puerto Rico]] is composed of 349 species, [[List of endemic fauna of Puerto Rico#Birds|16 of which]] are [[endemism in birds|endemic]] to the archipelago. Almost half of the species (166) are [[vagrancy (biology)|accidental]], meaning that they have been sighted only once or twice, and 42 of the species have been [[introduced species|introduced]], either directly or indirectly (mainly through habitat alteration), by humans.

The prevailing theory suggests that bird fauna colonized the West Indies by transoceanic dispersal during the glacial periods of the Pleistocene. The most primitive West Indies birds are the [[Tody|Todies]] which have an endemic representative in Puerto Rico, the [[Puerto Rican Tody]].<ref name=Bond/>

[[Image:Todus mexicanus.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Puerto Rican Tody]], one of the 16 endemic birds of Puerto Rico]]
Puerto Rico's avifauna has diminished due to extinction and extirpation, either by natural forces or human intervention. For example, fossil evidence was discovered for a species of [[swift]], ''Tachornis uranoceles'', dated to the late Pleistocene (between 17,000 and 21,000 years ago).<ref>Evidence also suggests that the fossil may come from the [[Wisconsin glaciation]].</ref> The species is believed to have become extinct as a result of habitat alteration after the [[Wisconsin glaciation]].<ref name=Olson/> At least six endemic species have become extinct in the last millennia:  Puerto Rican Barn Owl (''Tyto cavatica''), Puerto Rican Caracara (''Polyborus latebrosus''), Puerto Rico Parakeet (''Aratinga chloroptera maugei''), Puerto Rican Woodcock (''Scolopax anthonyi''), Puerto Rican quail-dove (''Geotrygon larva''), and the Antillean Cave-Rail (''Nesotrochis debooyi'').<ref>The Antillean Cave-Rail may have also occurred in the Virgin Islands.</ref> With a population of 13 individuals in 1975, the Puerto Rican Parrot almost became the seventh, but conservation efforts helped save the species from extinction. However, it is still one of the ten most [[Critically endangered species|critically-endangered birds]] in the world. Four Puerto Rican birds, the [[Hispaniolan Parakeet]], the [[White-necked Crow]], the [[Cuban Crow]], and the [[Limpkin]], became extirpated after Puerto Rico's population expansion in the latter half of the nineteenth century and three more species, the [[Black-bellied Whistling Duck]], the [[Black Rail]], and the [[Greater Flamingo]], no longer breed in the archipelago.

==Amphibians and reptiles==
[[Image:Puerto Rican crested toad.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Puerto Rican Crested Toad]], an endemic amphibian species of Puerto Rico]]
Puerto Rico's herpetofauna consists of 24 [[amphibian]] species and 61 [[reptile]] species. The majority of West Indian terrestrial reptile clade is believed to have arrived by flotsam dispersion from South America. Little evidence exists to support the alternative hypothesis of proto-Antillean vicariance.<ref>{{cite journal| author = Lindsey M. Hower and S.

 | format = pdf | accessdate = 2006-08-09}}</ref> As a result, Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean in general, has one of the highest percentages of endemism among amphibians and reptiles in the world. Amphibian species in Puerto Rico belong to four families: [[Bufonidae]] (2 species), [[Hylidae]] (3), [[Leptodactylidae]] (17) and [[Ranidae]] (2). Reptiles include [[turtle]]s (freshwater and marine), [[lizard]]s, [[worm lizard]]s, [[snake]]s and a [[caiman]].

All species of Ranidae and Hylidae occurring in Puerto Rico are introduced. One species from the Bufonidae family, the [[Cane Toad]], is introduced while the other, the [[Puerto Rican Crested Toad]], is endemic and critically endangered. The Cane Toad was introduced to Puerto Rico in the 1920s to control the populations of [[Phyllophaga (genus)|white-grub]] (''Phyllophaga'' spp.), a sugar cane pest. All species from the Leptodactylidae family are native to the region. Of the 17 Leptodactylidae species, 16 are from the [[Eleutherodactylus]] genus and are commonly known in Puerto Rico as coqu<U+00ED>s. Three of these, the [[Web-footed Coqui]], the [[Golden Coqui]] and the [[Mottled Coqui]], are likely to be extinct. The Golden Coqui is the only live-bearing species from the Leptodactylidae family and Cook's Robber Frog (''E. cooki'') is the only ''Eleutherodactylus'' sp. that exhibits [[sexual dimorphism]] in both size and color. The [[Coqu<U+00ED>|Common Coqu<U+00ED>]] (''Eleutherodactylus coqui'') is an unofficial national symbol of Puerto Rico and an important aspect of [[Puerto Rican culture]]. Since 13 of the 16 coqu<U+00ED>s are endemic to the archipelago, a common phrase used by Puerto Ricans to assert their national pride is "''De aqu<U+00ED> como el coqu<U+00ED>''" (From here [Puerto Rico] like the coqu<U+00ED>).

[[Image:Hawksbill turtle doeppne-108.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Hawksbill turtle]], a critically endangered species]]
Puerto Rico's turtle fauna includes both freshwater (5 species, including two extinct species) and marine turtles (5). Two of these species, the [[Hawksbill turtle]] and the [[Leatherback Sea Turtle]], are critically endangered. Threats to these species include habitat destruction and illegal capture of eggs and individuals. The [[Spectacled Caiman]], an introduced species, is the only representative of the Crocodilia order in Puerto Rico. The largest terrestrial lizard of the archipelago of Puerto Rico is the [[Mona Ground Iguana]] (''Cyclura cornuta stejnegeri''). A subspecies of the Rhinocerus Iguana (''Cyclura cornuta''), it is endemic to Mona Island, located in the [[Mona Passage]] between the main island of Puerto Rico and the [[Dominican Republic]]. Another ''Cyclura'' species of similar size, the Anegada Ground Iguana (''Cyclura pinguis''), once occurred in the archipelago but it became extirpated due to predation by dogs, cats, and humans, habitat destruction, and competition from goats and pigs, and is now restricted to [[Anegada]].

[[Image:Puerto Rican Boa.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Puerto Rican Boa]], Puerto Rico's largest snake]]
The 11 snake species occurring in Puerto Rico are generally considered non-poisonous, although research has concluded that at least one species, the Puerto Rican Racer, secretes venom.<ref>{{cite journal| author = Javier A.

The largest snake in Puerto Rico is the endemic [[Puerto Rican Boa]] (''Epicrates inornatus'') with a maximum length of 12&nbsp;ft (3.7&nbsp;m). The diet of snakes in Puerto Rico consists of reptiles (''Ameiva'', ''Anolis'', Geckos), ''coqu<U+00ED>s'' and other frogs, and, to a lesser extent, mice, birds and bats (exclusively by the Puerto Rican Boa).

==Invertebrates==

The [[invertebrate]] fauna of Puerto Rico is high in richness but low in diversity relative to mainland [[neotropical]] faunas of similar size and habitat diversity. Puerto Rico, in comparison to other Antillean islands, is the most extensively studied in regards to invertebrates. 

[[Image:Aedes aegypti biting human.jpg|200px|thumb|right|''[[Aedes aegypti]]'', arguably the most famous [[mosquito]] of Puerto Rico and host of the [[Dengue fever|dengue virus]]]]

Other terrestrial invertebrates described from Puerto Rico include [[earthworm]]s and cave dwelling animals. Eighteen native species of earthworm have been described, with 11 species belonging to the [[Glossoscolecidae]] family, 3 to the [[Megascolecidae]] family, and 4 to the [[Exxidae]] family.<ref>{{cite book |author=Paul F Hendrix |title=Earthworm Ecology and Biogeography in North America |year=1995 |publisher=CRC |location= |pages=76 |id=ISBN 1-56670-053-1}}</ref><ref>The taxonomic classification provided in Hendrix (1995) has been revised and this article presents the current classification.</ref> Seventy-eight invertebrate species are known to inhabit Puerto Rico's caves.

Forty-five percent of the species are predators while the remaining 55% are guano scavengers, detrivores and [[herbivore]]s. It is believed that most of this fauna arrived at Puerto Rico in the Pleistocene.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Steward B.

[[Image:Elkhorn coral.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Elkhorn coral, listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 2006]]
The marine invertebrate fauna of Puerto Rico is composed of 61 [[sea sponge|sponge]]s, 171 [[cnidarian]]s, 8 [[nemertean]]s, 1,176 [[mollusk]]s, 129 [[annelid]]s (polychaetes), 342 [[crustacean]]s, 165 [[echinoderm]]s, 131 [[bryozoan]]s, 117 [[hard coral]]s, 99 [[soft coral]]s and [[gorgonian]]s, 13 [[corallimorph]]s, and 8 [[hydrocoral]]s.<ref name="Marine"/><ref>Wilkinson, p.434.</ref> Coral species found in Puerto Rican reefs are representative of the general Caribbean fauna.

Invertebrate introductions have had an observable effect on Puerto Rican fauna. Native freshwater snails such as ''Physa cubensis'' have been adversely affected by introduced species. Currently, the most abundant snail in Puerto Rico is the [[Quilted Melania]] (''Tarebia granifera''), a species introduced from Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nis.gsmfc.org/nis_factsheet.php?toc_id=163|title= Fact Sheet for ''Tarebia granifera'' (Lamarck, 1822)|accessdate = 2006-08-11 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= }}</ref> Another invertebrate introduced to Puerto Rico is the [[honeybee]]. This animal competes with the endangered Puerto Rican Parrot for secondary nesting cavities at the Caribbean National Forest. [[Africanized bee]]s, which pose an even greater threat for secondary cavity nesters, have recently extended their range to Puerto Rico. Other introductions include 18 species of [[ant]], one of the most abundant taxa in [[Plant litter|leaf litter]] habitats.<ref>Reagan and Waide, p. 159-160.</ref>

==Human effect and conservation==

The fauna of Puerto Rico has been subjected to human influence since the arrival of the [[Ortoiroid]], Puerto Rico's first [[settler]]s, approximately 4,000 years ago. The native fauna was used by the island's indigenous population as a source of food, while others were used for skins and trade. Significant  declines in the populations and diversity of the islands fauna are believed to have begun after the arrival of European settlers in the sixteenth century. Habitat destruction, primarily as a result of forest clearing for sugar cane plantations, had a devastating effect on Puerto Rican fauna during the latter half of the nineteenth century. Furthermore, human-introduced species such as rats, cats, the Small Asian Mongoose, and the Cane Toad have had a profound effect on the native fauna of Puerto Rico. Rats on Monito Island are believed to be a limiting factor on the abundance of the endemic [[Monito Gecko]],<ref>{{cite journal |quotes= |author=M. A. Garc<U+00ED>a, C. E. Diez, and A. O.

Conservation efforts include both land and species protection. Approximately 895&nbsp;ha (equal to 3.4% of total land area) divided among 34 reserves are protected in Puerto Rico.<ref name=Earthtrend/> According to the IUCN there are 21 threatened species in Puerto Rico: 2 mammals, 8 breeding birds, 8 reptiles, and 3 amphibians. The U.S. federal government lists 5 mammals, 2 amphibians, 8 birds, and 10 reptiles under the Federal [[Endangered Species Act]]. The Puerto Rican government, through the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER), produces its own threatened species list which includes 18 critically endangered species (3 amphibians, 7 birds, 3 reptiles, 2 fish and 3 invertebrates), and 14 endangered species.<ref>Puerto Rico's wildlife comprehensive strategy, p.2</ref><ref>For the complete threatened species list refer to [http://www.drna.gobierno.pr/reglamentospdf/DRNA/Reglamento%20de%20Vida%20Silvestre%20(listadespeciesprotegida).pdf#search=%22especies%20en%20peligro%20de%20extinci%C3%B3n%2C%20puerto%20rico%2C%20site%3Agobierno.pr%22 this document].</ref> The DNER follows the IUCN classification scheme for species' priority assignment. 

[[Image:Amazona vitatta.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Puerto Rican Parrot]].  Conservation efforts have saved this species from extinction.]]
Birds currently receive the greatest attention in regards to conservation. Arguably the most successful recovery plan in Puerto Rico is the Puerto Rican Parrot Recovery Plan. Initiated in 1968, its main objective was to downlist the Puerto Rican Parrot's status from critical to threatened by the year 2020. Other objectives include the establishment of two separate, effective, wild populations (500 or more individuals for 5 years), the protection of habitat for those populations and the control of predators, parasites and competitors of the species. Currently, the total wild parrot population is estimated at 44 individuals, and 105 birds are in captivity.<ref name=RecoveryPlan>{{cite web|title=Technical/Agency Draft Revised Recovery Plan for the Puerto Rican Parrot (''Amazona vittata'')|url=http://ecos.fws.gov/docs/recovery_plans/1999/990430.pdf|publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|date=April 1999|accessdate = June 7|accessyear=2006}}</ref> This program was fundamental in raising ecological awareness in Puerto Rico.

The Puerto Rico Breeding Bird Survey (PRBBS), established in 1997, is a program with the purpose of monitoring the status and trends of Puerto Rican breeding bird populations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/BBS/Puerto_Rico/|title=BBS - Puerto Rico |accessdate = 2006-09-09|format= |work= |publisher=}}</ref> The information gathered by these surveys is used by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS) to assess bird conservation priorities. Other conservation programs by the USFWS include the Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands Migratory Bird Conservation and the maintenance of 5 wildlife refuges at [[Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico|Cabo Rojo]], Laguna Cartagena, [[Vieques, Puerto Rico|Vieques]], [[Culebra, Puerto Rico|Culebra]] and Desecheo. Other institutions supporting bird conservation in Puerto Rico are the Puerto Rican Ornithological Society and the Puerto Rico National History Association.

[[Marine conservation]] has recently garnered support in Puerto Rico. The archipelago has an estimated 700&nbsp;miles (1,126.5&nbsp;km) of coastline and 1,300&nbsp;mi<U+00B2> (3,370&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of coral reef communities.<ref>Wilkinson, p.435.</ref> The Department of Natural Resources of Puerto Rico maintains 25 areas with marine components but only two of these (11&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) are designated as no-take zones. All turtle species occurring in Puerto Rico's waters are classified as either endangered or threatened. [[Earthwatch]]-supported turtle conservation programs and U.S. federal programs have raised local awareness and have contributed to the decline of egg-poaching and turtle meat consumption.
