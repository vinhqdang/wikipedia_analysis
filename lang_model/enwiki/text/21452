'''''A Rush of Blood to the Head''''' is the second [[studio album]] by English [[alternative rock]] band [[Coldplay]], released on August 26, 2002 in the United Kingdom by record label [[Parlophone]]. Produced by the band and British record producer [[Ken Nelson (British record producer)|Ken Nelson]], the recording of the album began a week after the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States, which gave the band a fresh perspective in the songwriting. The songs featured in the album have a greater use of piano and guitar than Coldplay's debut album, ''[[Parachutes]]''.

The album was a commercial success, debuting at number one in the United Kingdom and later placing at number seven of the country's 20&nbsp;biggest-selling albums in the 21st&nbsp;century. The [[British Phonographic Industry]] has since certified the album eight-times platinum for its accumulated sales of over 2.6&nbsp;million units. The album has spawned the hit singles "[[In My Place]]", "[[The Scientist (song)|The Scientist]]", "[[Clocks (song)|Clocks]]", and "[[God Put a Smile upon Your Face]]". ''A Rush of Blood to the Head'' has been praised by the critics, considering it better than ''Parachutes''. It won the [[44th Grammy Awards|2002 Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Album]] and [[Record of the Year]] for the song "Clocks", becoming Coldplay's largest hit to date.

==Background==
[[Coldplay]] became popular in Europe and overseas with the release of their debut album, ''[[Parachutes]]'', and one of its singles, "[[Yellow (song)|Yellow]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/reviews/album_review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1242166|title=Parachutes: Coldplay|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref> The album debuted on the [[UK Albums Chart]] at number one, and the single gave the band their first taste of fame in [[North America]]. Despite this, while recording ''A Rush of Blood to the Head'', the band did not feel sophomore slump pressure. However, when they began to open to press about their new work, things started to scare them: "Everyone's been saying, 'What do you think about the pressure?'"<ref name="CumberbacthOut">{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1456997/08132002/coldplay.jhtml|title=Coldplay: Going Out of My Head|last=Cumberbatch|first=Franklin|date=2002-08-13|work=VH1|publisher=MTV Networks|accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref>

The band started recording the album in London a week after the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States, during which their songs "garnered larger audiences".<ref name="CumberbacthOut"/><ref name="MossHeats">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1451517/20011217/coldplay.jhtml|title=Coldplay Ready Second Album As 'Trouble' Heats Up|last=Moss|first=Corey|coauthors=Cornell, Jeff|date=2001-12-18|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2008-09-03}}</ref> Since the band had never stayed in London before, they had trouble focusing. So they decided to relocate in [[Liverpool]], where they recorded some of the songs on ''Parachutes''. Once there, vocalist [[Chris Martin]] said that they became obsessed with recording.<ref name="CumberbacthOut"/>

"[[In My Place]]" was the first song recorded for the album. The band released it as the album's lead single because they saw, being one of the songs left after ''Parachutes'', importance in it, which was to record another album and think they could still write songs. Martin said: "Three months after ''Parachutes'' took off, we went through a strange period of not really knowing what we were doing. One thing kept us going: recording 'In My Place'. Then other songs started coming."<ref name="CumberbacthOut"/> The band wrote more than 20&nbsp;songs for the album. Some of their new materials, including "In My Place" and "Animals", were played while on tour.<ref name="MossHeats"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1439294/20010212/coldplay.jhtml|title=Coldplay Warm Up On U.S. Tour Opener|last=Nelson|first=Chris|date=2001-02-12|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref> The album's title was revealed through a post on the band's official website.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1475357|title=Coldplay Sets Album Title, June Gigs|last=Luerssen|first=John D.|date=2002-04-25|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref>

==Recording==
Following the release of ''Parachutes'', the band started recording ''A Rush of Blood to the Head'' the week after the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States.<ref name="MossHeats"/> In Liverpool, it was just vocalist Chris Martin and guitarist [[Jonny Buckland]] working on the weekends. By every Monday, they would present to their band mates something they had developed.<ref name="CumberbacthOut"/> While ''A Rush of Blood to the Head'' was nearly completed, Martin went into the studio late one night and wrote the [[riff]] that popped into his mind. This came special to the band as soon as Martin played it to them. Unfinished, however, they thought they had no time to complete it for the album, which had already 10 completed songs. So they recorded a [[demo (music)|demo]] version of the track that was later titled "[[Clocks (song)|Clocks]]"; it was filed, together with other unfinished tracks, under a CD marked "Songs for #3", which was projected for the band's third studio album.<ref name="WiederhornRoad">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1484768/20040202/coldplay.jhtml|title=Road To The Grammys: The Making Of Coldplay's 'Clocks'|last=Wiederhorn|first=Jon|date=2004-02-02|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref><ref name="WebbStory">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/story-of-the-song-clocks-coldplay-2002-876537.html|title=Story of the Song: 'Clocks', Coldplay (2002)|last=Webb|first=Robert|date=2008-07-25|publisher=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref>

Eventually, Coldplay completed ''A Rush of Blood to the Head'' by June 2002, and was ready to hand it over to their record label, [[Parlophone]]. However, the band thought their output sounded "rubbish". Unhappy of putting something they were completely unsatisfied with, the band had reached an agreement with the label to postpone the release of the album.<ref name="WiederhornRoad"/><ref name="WebbStory"/>

Subsequently, there were many songs discarded because, according to Martin, it best fit to ''Parachutes''. For him, making the likes of ''Parachutes'' was not anymore interesting to them: "It would have shown that we're happy to sit back on what we'd done, and we're not. For us it was important to progress and try to improve upon our abilities as musicians." Always in search of perfection, however, this encountered the band sometimes with "practice sessions ended abruptly with one or more members of Coldplay threatening to quit".<ref name="WiederhornBleed">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1457204/20020827/coldplay.jhtml|title=Coldplay Bleed For Beauty On A Rush Of Blood To The Head|last=Wiederhorn|first=Jon|date=2002-08-27|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref> After headlining 2002's [[Glastonbury Festival]], Coldplay returned into the studio to work "Songs for #3" out. [[Phil Harvey (manager)|Phil Harvey]], the band's manager, heard of "Clocks" and urged them to rework it immediately: "No, you must do that song now 'cause you're going on [in the lyrics] about urgency, and you're talking about keeping this song back. That doesn't make sense."<ref name="WiederhornRoad"/><ref name="WebbStory"/>

Martin has claimed that the album's [[title track]] is a homage to American singer-songwriter [[Johnny Cash]], whom he considered as one of "the greatest&nbsp;... men with just guitars".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1611108|title=Cash 'Comes Around' On New 'American' Album|last=Orshoski|first=Wes|date=2002-08-16|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref>

==Cover==
The [[cover art]] for ''A Rush of Blood to the Head'' was designed by photographer S<U+00F8>lve Sundsb<U+00F8>. Before Martin knew of the image, Sundsb<U+00F8> was hired by fashion magazine ''[[Dazed & Confused (magazine)|Dazed & Confused]]'' in the late 1990s. The magazine's editor wanted him to produce something with a "technological feel, something all white". As an artist, he tried to do "stuff that hasn't been done before, which is virtually impossible"; he suggested taking shots using a [[3D scanner|three-dimensional scanning machine]].<ref name="BenedictusShot">{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2008/feb/14/photography.art|title=S<U+00F8>lve Sundsb<U+00F8>'s best shot|last=Benedictus|first=Leo|date=2008-02-14|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2008-09-10}}</ref>

The model for the shot wore an all-white makeup because it produces the "best results"; however, for the image, the model also wore a [[twill]]-colored cape. The computer could not read the colors so it was replaced with spikes, and the head in the image was chopped because the machine only scanned 30&nbsp;centimetres. The editor of the magazine liked the image and eventually featured it in one of their publications.<ref name="BenedictusShot"/>

Martin saw the image in the magazine. He approached Sundsb<U+00F8> and asked him to use the image for the cover image of ''A Rush of Blood to the Head''. For the album's [[single (music)|singles]], Martin asked Sundsb<U+00F8> what he could do; the latter suggested scanning the head of each member of the band.<ref name="BenedictusShot"/>

The album dominantly features songs with guitars and piano used. There are tracks that have been considered far from [[n<U+00FC>-metal]], but are more "turbulent" than Coldplay's previous works.<ref name="WiederhornBleed"/> The album includes "guitar-pop", [[ballad]]s, and acoustic songs. However, the [[U2]]-esque [[arena rock|epic rock]] of the album's opening track "Politik", the piano-driven "[[Clocks (song)|Clocks]]", and the loud guitars of "A Whisper" were seen as an extension of the band's musical range.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/music/2002/08/26/rush_of_blood.shtml|title=Coldplay - A Rush Of Blood To The Head|date=2002-08-26|work=[[BBC Music]]|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref>

Recording the album after the September 11 attacks gave the band a fresh perspective: "The new songs are reflective of new attitudes. [They tell listeners] not to be frightened. Anybody can achieve whatever they want to."<ref name="MossHeats"/> Most of the song lyrics are about urgency. Martin has commented that previous songs were more relaxed since they were in a comfortable state of mind: "Perhaps there's a bit more urgency on some of these songs. And that's born from all the places we've been and the thing's we've experienced." Martin has also explained, in relation to the theme of urgency, that the album's title means "doing something on impulse".<ref name="WiederhornBleed"/> Some songs featured in the album are about relationships. They are based on reality; however, they were written with fictional twist, according to Martin. There are songs also that are like [[fairy tale]]s, with a beginning and an ending story.<ref name="CumberbacthOut"/>

==Release and reception==
The album was made available in August 2002, two months after its original release date.<ref name="WebbStory"/> Record label [[Parlophone]] released the album on August 26 in the United Kingdom. It was released on August 27 in the United States through [[Capitol Records]].

''A Rush of Blood to the Head'' has earned the band several awards from domestic and international music press. In 2002, it was awarded Best Album at the ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' Awards.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2328003.stm|title=Q Awards 2002: Winners|date=2002-10-14|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref> In the same year, the band won two at the [[Grammy Awards]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Music Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] for the song "[[In My Place]]".<ref name="Grammy">{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title=&winner=Coldplay&year=0&genreID=0&hp=1|title=Grammy Awards Winners|publisher=The Recording Academy|accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref> In 2003, it won Best British Album at the [[BRIT Awards]], and the following year, the band earned their first [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]] for the song "[[Clocks (song)|Clocks]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2655109.stm|title=Brit Awards 2003: Winners|date=2003-02-21|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref><ref name="Grammy"/>

The album also received other accolades.

===Critical reviews===
''A Rush of Blood to the Head'' has since received acclaim from European critics. Many of them complimented the album in various aspects, and felt it is better than ''Parachutes''. Alexis Petridis of the ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper wrote that the band's "new assurance is everywhere" in the album, and that "the timidity of ''Parachutes'' is nowhere to be found" in it. He concludes, "It sounds like an album ready to take on the world, and win."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2002/aug/16/popandrock.artsfeatures|title=Coldplay: A Rush of Blood to the Head|last=Petridis|first=Alexis|date=2002-08-16|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref>

The album has also been lauded among international critics, the same as it did in Europe. [[Kelefa Sanneh]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised the album, commenting that it is "one of the year's best albums" and describing it as "sparser, stranger and even catchier than its predecessor".<ref name="KelefaVertigo">{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06EED7113AF937A2575BC0A9649C8B63|title=POP REVIEW; Vertigo From the Falsetto and 'Parachutes'|last=Sanneh|first=Kelefa|date=2002-08-14|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's Rob Sheffield, who was less happy with ''Parachutes'', said that "''A Rush of Blood to the Head'' is a nervier, edgier, thoroughly surprising album", adding, "But where ''Parachutes'' was the clumsy diary of a high-strung kid, ''A Rush of Blood'' sounds more like a band with the confidence to test its own limits."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/coldplay/albums/album/171751/review/5943034/a_rush_of_blood_to_the_head|title=Coldplay: A Rush Of Blood To The Head|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|date=2002-08-26|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref> MacKenzie Wilson of [[Allmusic]] echoed the above comments saying that it is a "strong album". Wilson, who compliments Martin for his "sharpened" [[falsetto]] and refined "haunting delivery" and Buckland for his "riveting guitar work", notes that "regardless of the band still being in their mid-twenties, they've made an amazing record".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:t1abqj3qojfa~T1|title=A Rush of Blood to the Head: Coldplay|last=Wilson|first=MacKenzie|work=Allmusic|publisher=Macrovision Company|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref> Emma Pearse of the American newspaper ''[[The Village Voice]]'' has the same sentiments, stating that is it "a little edgier, trancier, and more conversational" compared to ''Parachutes''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0238/pearse.php|title=New Shapes and Colors|last=Pearse|first=Emma|date=2002-09-17|work=The Village Voice|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref>
