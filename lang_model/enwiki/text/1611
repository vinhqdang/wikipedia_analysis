Most of Belfast is in [[County Antrim]], but parts of East and South Belfast are in [[County Down]]. 
It is on the [[flood plain]] of the [[River Lagan]].<ref>{{cite book|authors=Beesley, S. & Wilde, J. |year=1997|title=Urban Flora of Belfast|publisher=The Institute of Irish Studies and The Queen's University of Belfast|isbn=0 85389 695 X}}</ref>

By population, Belfast is one of the largest cities in the United Kingdom and the second largest on the [[Ireland|island of Ireland]]. It is the seat of the [[Devolution#United Kingdom|devolved]] [[Northern Ireland Executive|government]] and legislative [[Northern Ireland Assembly]].<ref name="MSN Encarta">{{cite encyclopedia | title = Northern Ireland | work = MSN Encarta <U+2013> Northern Ireland | publisher = Microsoft | url = http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761571415/Northern_Ireland.html | accessdate = 29 October 2007 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257012982925640 | archivedate = 31 October 2009}}</ref> At the time of the 2011 census, the city of Belfast had a population of 286,000<ref name="demography1"/> and lies at the heart of the Belfast Urban area, which has a population of 483,418<ref name = "UK stat"/> and the [[Belfast Metropolitan Area]], which had a population of 579,276 at the 2001 census.<ref name = "nisra.gov.uk"/> The [[Larger Urban Zone]], as defined by the [[European Union]], has a total population 641,638.{{when|date=March 2014}}{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Belfast was granted [[City status in the United Kingdom#Northern Ireland|city status]] in 1888.

Historically, Belfast has been a centre for the Irish [[linen]] industry (earning the nickname "[[Linenopolis]]"), tobacco production, rope-making and shipbuilding: the city's main shipbuilders, [[Harland and Wolff]], which built the well-known ''[[RMS Titanic]]'', propelled Belfast on to the global stage in the early 20th century as the biggest and most productive shipyard in the world.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Belfast played a key role in the [[Industrial Revolution]], establishing its place as a global industrial centre until the latter half of the 20th century. Industrialisation and the inward migration it brought made Belfast, if briefly, the biggest city in Ireland at the beginning of the 20th century, and the city's industrial and economic success was cited by [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] opponents of [[Irish Home Rule|Home Rule]] as a reason why Ireland should shun devolution and later why [[Ulster unionism|Ulster unionists]] in particular would fight to resist it.

Today, Belfast remains a centre for industry, as well as the arts, higher education, business, and law, and is the economic engine of Northern Ireland. The city suffered greatly during the period of conflict called "[[the Troubles]]", but latterly has undergone a sustained period of calm, free from the intense political violence of former years, and substantial economic and commercial growth. Additionally, [[Belfast city centre]] has undergone considerable expansion and regeneration in recent years, notably around [[Victoria Square (Belfast)|Victoria Square]].

Belfast is served by two airports: [[George Best Belfast City Airport]] in the city, and [[Belfast International Airport]] {{convert|15|mi|km|0}} west of the city. Belfast is also a major port, with commercial and industrial docks dominating the [[Belfast Lough]] shoreline, including the famous Harland and Wolff shipyard. Belfast is a constituent city of the [[Dublin-Belfast corridor]], which has a population of three million, or half the total population of the island of Ireland. Belfast is listed by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network|Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC)]] as a [[global city]], with a ranking of 'Gamma'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2012t.html|title=The World According to GaWC 2012|work=Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) Study Group and Network|publisher=Loughborough University|accessdate=2014-02-15}}</ref>

== Name ==

The name ''Belfast'' is derived from the Irish ''B<U+00E9>al Feirsde'', which was later spelled ''B<U+00E9>al Feirste''.<ref>[http://www.dil.ie/browse-small.asp ''Dictionary of the Irish Language'']{{dead link|date=May 2014}}: ''b<U+00E9>l'' (Letter B, Column 61); ''fertas'' (Letter F, Column 96).</ref> The word ''b<U+00E9>al'' means "mouth" or "rivermouth" while ''feirsde/feirste'' is the genitive singular of ''fearsaid'' and refers to a [[shoal|sandbar]] or tidal [[ford (crossing)|ford]] across a river's mouth.<ref name="Logainm">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/?text=Belfast&placeID=118005&uiLang=en |title=Placenames Database of Ireland <U+2013> Belfast |publisher=Logainm.ie |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref><ref name="Belfast name">{{cite web | title = Placenames/Logainmneacha <U+2013> Belfast | work = BBC Northern Ireland <U+2013> Education |publisher=BBC | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/irish/blas/education/beginnersblas/1belfast.shtml | accessdate = 17 May 2007}}</ref> The name would thus translate literally as "(river) mouth of the sandbar" or "(river) mouth of the ford".<ref name="Logainm"/> This sandbar was formed at the confluence of two rivers at what is now Donegall Quay: the [[River Lagan|Lagan]], which flows into Belfast Lough, and its tributary the [[River Farset|Farset]]. This area was the hub around which the original settlement developed.<ref>{{cite book | last = Keenan | first = Desmond | title = Pre-Famine Ireland | pages = Chapter 5 | publisher = XLibris.com | url = http://www.deskeenan.com/4PrChapter5.htm | year= 2000 | nopp = true}}</ref> The Irish name ''B<U+00E9>al Feirste'' is shared by a [[townland]] in [[County Mayo]], whose name has been anglicised as ''Belfarsad''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/37016.aspx |title=Placenames Database of Ireland <U+2013> Belfarsad |publisher=Logainm.ie |accessdate=13 November 2010}}</ref>

An alternative interpretation of the name is "mouth of [the river] of the sandbar", an allusion to the River Farset, which flows into the Lagan where the sandbar was located. This interpretation was favoured by [[Edmund Hogan]] and [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Onomasticon Goedelicum |last=Hogan |first=Edmund |year=1910 |location=Dublin |url=http://publish.ucc.ie/doi/locus/B}}; {{Cite book|title=Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland |last=O'Donovan |first=John |year=1856 |location=Dublin |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/annalarioghachta04ocle#page/1100/mode/2up}}</ref> It seems clear, however, that the river itself was also named after the tidal crossing.<ref name="Logainm"/>

In [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]] the name of the city is ''Bilfawst''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linenhall.com/irishAndReference.asp#ULSTERSCOTS |title=The Linen Hall Library |publisher=The Linen Hall Library |accessdate=13 April 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.northsouthministerialcouncil.org/web_2006_ulster_scots_report.pdf 2006 annual report in Ulster-Scots] North/South Ministerial Council.</ref> or ''Bilfaust'',<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ulsterscots/library/switherin-agen BBC Ulster-Scots Library <U+2013> Switherin agen] Ullans Speakers Association.

=== Origins ===
[[File:Belfast Castle, Northern Ireland.jpg|thumb|Belfast Castle]]

The site of Belfast has been occupied since the [[Bronze Age]]. The [[Giants Ring, Belfast|Giant's Ring]], a 5,000-year-old [[henge]], is located near the city, and the remains of [[Iron Age]] [[hill fort]]s can still be seen in the surrounding hills. Belfast remained a small settlement of little importance during the [[High Middle Ages|Middle Ages]]. [[John de Courcy]] built a castle on what is now Castle Street in the city centre in the 12th century, but this was on a lesser scale and not as strategically important as [[Carrickfergus Castle]] to the north, which was built by de Courcy in 1177. The [[O'Neill dynasty|O'Neill]] clan had a presence in the area.

In the 14th century, Cloinne Aodha Buidhe, descendants of Aodh Buidhe O'Neill built Grey Castle at Castlereagh, now in the east of the city.<ref>{{cite book | last = Komesu | first = Okifumi | title = Irish Writers and Politics | page = 73 | publisher = Rowman & Littlefield | url = http://books.google.com/?id=AwFO2Z8Bk0YC&pg=PA73&lpg=PA73&dq=%22yellow+hugh+o+neill%22 | year= 1990 | isbn = 978-0-389-20926-3}}</ref> Conn O'Neill of the Clannaboy O'Neills owned vast lands in the area and was the last inhabitant of Grey Castle, one remaining link being the Conn's Water river flowing through east Belfast.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.theflightoftheearls.net/May2406.pdf |title=Celebrations mark the arrival of first Ulster Scots in Ireland |publisher=Irish News |date=24 April 2006 |accessdate=18 September 2007|format=PDF| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070927114138/http://www.theflightoftheearls.net/May2406.pdf| archivedate= 27 September 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

=== Growth ===

Belfast became a substantial settlement in the 17th century after being established as a town by [[Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Chichester|Sir Arthur Chichester]],<ref name="belfast castle history">{{cite web |title=History of Belfast Castle |work=Tourism and venues |publisher=[[Belfast City Council]] |year=2014 |url=http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/tourism-venues/belfastcastle/bchistory.aspx |accessdate=19 May 2014 }}</ref> which was initially settled by Protestant English and Scottish migrants at the time of the [[Plantation of Ulster]]. (Belfast and County Antrim, however, did not form part of this particular Plantation scheme as they were privately colonised.) In 1791, the [[Society of United Irishmen]] was founded in Belfast, after [[Henry Joy McCracken]] and other prominent Presbyterians from the city invited [[Theobald Wolfe Tone]] and [[Thomas Russell (rebel)|Thomas Russell]] to a meeting, after having read Tone's "Argument on Behalf of the Catholics of Ireland".<ref name="Connolly">{{Cite book |title=Divided Kingdom; Ireland 1630-1800 |first=Sean J. |last=Connolly |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-19-958387-4 |pages=434-449}}</ref> Evidence of this period of Belfast's growth can still be seen in the oldest areas of the city, known as the [[The Belfast Entries|Entries]].

Belfast blossomed as a commercial and industrial centre in the 18th and 19th centuries and became Ireland's pre-eminent industrial city. Industries thrived, including linen, rope-making, tobacco, heavy engineering and shipbuilding, and at the end of the 19th century, Belfast briefly overtook Dublin as the largest city in Ireland. The Harland and Wolff shipyards became one of the largest shipbuilders in the world, employing up to 35,000 workers.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/3176184.stm |title=Cranes to remain on city skyline |publisher=BBC News |date=9 October 2003 |accessdate=12 March 2007}}</ref> In 1886 the city suffered intense [[1886 Belfast riots|riots]] over the issue of home rule, which had divided the city.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ryland |first=Frederick |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Events of the Reign 1837-1897 |publisher=[[Allen & Unwin|George Allen]] |year=1897 |location=London |pages=101 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lw4QAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA101 |oclc=267093697 }}</ref>

In 1920<U+2013>22, Belfast became the capital of the new entity of Northern Ireland as the island of Ireland was partitioned. The accompanying conflict (the [[Irish War of Independence]]) cost up to 500 lives in Belfast, the bloodiest sectarian strife in the city until the Troubles of the late 1960s onwards.<ref>Robert Lynch, The Northern IRA and the Early Years of Partition, p227</ref>

Belfast was [[Belfast Blitz|heavily bombed]] during [[World War II]]. In one raid, in 1941, German bombers killed around one thousand people and left tens of thousands homeless. Apart from London, this was the greatest loss of life in a night raid during the [[The Blitz|Blitz]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1269206.stm |title=The Belfast blitz is remembered |publisher=BBC News |date=11 April 2001 |accessdate=12 March 2007}}</ref>

=== The Troubles ===
{{Main|The Troubles}}
[[File:Donegall st bomb.jpg|thumb|[[1972 Donegall Street bombing]] by the [[Provisional IRA]]]]

Belfast has been the capital of Northern Ireland since its establishment in 1921 following the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]. It had been the scene of various episodes of sectarian conflict between its Catholic and Protestant populations. These opposing groups in this conflict are now often termed [[Irish republicanism|republican]] and [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] respectively, although they are also referred to as '[[Irish nationalism|nationalist]]' and '[[Unionism (Ireland)|unionist]]'. The most recent example of this conflict was known as the Troubles <U+2013> a civil conflict that raged from around 1969 to 1998.<ref name="bbc trouble history">{{cite web |last=Kelters |first=Seamus |title=Violence in the Troubles |work=History |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=February 2013 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/topics/troubles_violence |accessdate=19 May 2014 }}</ref>

Belfast saw some of the worst of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, particularly in the 1970s, with rival paramilitary groups formed on both sides. Bombing, assassination and street violence formed a backdrop to life throughout the Troubles. The [[Provisional IRA]] detonated 22 bombs within the confines of Belfast city centre in 1972, on what is known as "[[Bloody Friday (1972)|Bloody Friday]]", killing nine people. Loyalist paramilitaries including the [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) and the [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA) claimed that the killings they carried out were in retaliation for the [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969-1997|IRA campaign]]. Most of their victims were Catholics with no links to the Provisional IRA.<ref>{{cite book | last = <U+00D3> Dochartaigh | first = Niall | authorlink = Toby Harnden | title = From Civil Rights To Armalites | publisher = [[Cork University Press]] | year = 1999 | page = 292 | isbn = 978-1-85918-108-9}}</ref> A particularly notorious group, based on the [[Shankill Road]] in the mid-1970s, became known as the [[Shankill Butchers]].

In all, over 1,600 people were killed in political violence in the city between 1969 and 2001.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/search.html |title=Sutton Index of Deaths |publisher=CAIN |accessdate=9 July 2013 | date=11 April 2001 |quote=Search for Belfast in "Text Search of Description (and key words)"}}</ref> Due to the violence, even continuing today, Belfast is often referred to as the "''European Capital of Terrorism''"{{according to whom|date=May 2014}}.

== Governance ==

Belfast was granted [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]] by [[James VI and I]] in 1613 and official [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1888.<ref>{{cite web | title = Belfast City Hall: History and Background | publisher = Belfast City Council | url = http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/cityhall/history.asp?menuitem=background | accessdate = 24 May 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070504052645/http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/cityhall/history.asp?menuitem=background| archivedate= 4 May 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Since 1973 it has been a [[Local Government (Boundaries) Act (Northern Ireland) 1971|local government district]] under local administration by [[Belfast City Council]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Local Government (Boundaries) Act (Northern Ireland) 1971 | publisher = Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN) | year= 2007 | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/lgba1971.htm | accessdate = 24 May 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070707194021/http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/lgba1971.htm| archivedate= 7 July 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Belfast is represented in both the [[British House of Commons]] and in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]].

=== Local government ===
{{Details|Belfast City Council}}
[[File:Belfast City Hall 2.jpg|thumb|Belfast City Hall]]

Belfast City Council is the [[Local government in Northern Ireland|local council]] with responsibility for the city. The city's elected officials are the [[Lord Mayor of Belfast]], Deputy Lord Mayor and [[High Sheriff]] who are elected from among 51 [[councillors]]. The first Lord Mayor of Belfast was Daniel Dixon, who was elected in 1892.<ref name="Belfast City Council - Lord Mayor">{{cite web | title = Councillors: Lord Mayor | publisher = Belfast City Council | url = http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/councillors/index.asp?menuitem2=lord-mayor | accessdate = 24 May 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070607193627/http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/councillors/index.asp?menuitem2=lord-mayor| archivedate= 7 June 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> The current [[Lord Mayor]] is [[Mairtin O'Muilleoir]] of [[Sinn F<U+00E9>in]], while the Deputy Lord Mayor is Councillor Christopher Stalford of the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP), both of whom were elected in June 2013 to serve a one-year term. The Lord Mayor's duties include presiding over meetings of the council, receiving distinguished visitors to the city, and representing and promoting the city on the national and international stage.<ref name="Belfast City Council - Lord Mayor"/>

In 1997, [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionists]] lost overall control of Belfast City Council for the first time in its history, with the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]] gaining the balance of power between [[Irish nationalism|Nationalists]] and Unionists. This position was confirmed in the three subsequent council elections, with mayors from Nationalist Sinn F<U+00E9>in and [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP), and the cross-community Alliance Party regularly elected since. The first nationalist Lord Mayor of Belfast was Alban Maginness of the SDLP, in 1997.

The [[Northern Ireland local government elections, 2011|last elections]] to Belfast City Council were held on 5 May 2011, with the City's voters electing fifty-one councillors across [[Electoral wards of Belfast|nine district electoral areas]]. The election saw Nationalist councillors outnumber Unionist councillors for the first time, with Sinn F<U+00E9>in becoming the largest party: 16(+2) Sinn F<U+00E9>in, 15(-) [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP), 8(-) [[Social Democratic and Labour Party|SDLP]], 6(+2) [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]], 3(<U+2212>4) [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP), 2 [[Progressive Unionist Party]] (PUP), and 1 Independent (a former deputy mayor who takes the UUP whip was a member of the defunct [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] paramilitary linked-[[Ulster Democratic Party]]).<ref>{{cite web | title = Belfast City Council Elections 1993<U+2013>2005 | work = Northern Ireland Elections | publisher = Northern Ireland Social and Political Archive (ARK) | year= 2005 | url = http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/lgbelfast.htm | accessdate = 24 May 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070608000519/http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/lgbelfast.htm| archivedate= 8 June 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

As Northern Ireland's capital city, Belfast is host to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] at [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Stormont]], the site of the [[Devolution#Northern Ireland|devolved]] legislature for Northern Ireland. Belfast is divided into four [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK parliamentary]] constituencies: [[Belfast North (UK Parliament constituency)|North Belfast]], [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)|West Belfast]], [[Belfast South (UK Parliament constituency)|South Belfast]] and [[Belfast East (UK Parliament constituency)|East Belfast]]. All four extend beyond the city boundaries to include parts of [[Castlereagh (borough)|Castlereagh]], [[Lisburn City Council|Lisburn]] and [[Newtownabbey Borough Council|Newtownabbey]] districts. In the [[Northern Ireland Assembly election, 2011|Northern Ireland Assembly Elections in 2011]], Belfast elected 24 [[Members of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLAs), 6 from each [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in Northern Ireland|constituency]]. Belfast elected 8 [[Sinn F<U+00E9>in]], 7 [[Democratic Unionist Party|DUP]], 4 [[Social Democratic and Labour Party|SDLP]], 3 [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]], and 2 [[Ulster Unionist Party|UUP]] MLAs.<ref>{{cite news | title = Northern Ireland election |publisher=BBC News | date= 11 May 2011 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/election2011/constituency/html/northern_ireland.stm | accessdate = 15 February 2014}}</ref> In the 2010 UK general election, Belfast elected one [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] from each constituency to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] at Westminster, London.

=== Coat of arms and motto ===
[[File:Belfast City Coat of Arms.svg|thumb|Belfast's coat of arms was adopted in 1890]]

The city of Belfast has the [[Latin]] motto "{{lang|la|''Pro tanto quid retribuamus''}}." This is taken from [[Psalms|Psalm]] 116 Verse 12 in the Latin [[Vulgate|Vulgate Bible]] and is literally "For so much what shall we repay " The verse has been translated in bibles differently <U+2013> for example as "What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me?".<ref>King James Bible, Psalm 116 Verse 12</ref> It is also translated as "In return for so much, what shall we give back?"<ref>"I reflected on the two mottos of Belfast and America <U+2013> '{{lang|la|''Pro Tanto Quid''}}' and '{{lang|la|''E Pluribus Unum''}}'. I am reliably informed that these roughly translate as 'In return for so much, what shall we give back?' and 'From many, one'." [http://allianceparty.org/article/2004/000554/celebrating-diversity-by-belfast-lord-mayor-tom-ekin Celebrating diversity], by Belfast Lord Mayor Tom Ekin</ref> The [[Queen's University Belfast|Queen's University]] Students' Union [[Rag Week]] publication ''PTQ'' derives its name from the first three words of the motto.

The [[coat of arms]] of the city are blazoned as ''Party per fesse argent and azure, in chief a pile vair and on a canton gules a bell argent, in base a ship with sails set argent on waves of the sea proper''. This heraldic language describes a shield that is divided in two horizontally (''party per fesse''). The top (''chief'') of the shield is silver (''argent''), and has a point-down triangle (''a pile'') with a repeating blue-and-white pattern that represents fur (''vair''). There is also a red square in the top corner (''a canton gules'') on which there is a silver bell. It is likely that the bell is an example here of "canting" (or punning) heraldry, representing the first syllable of Belfast. In the lower part of the shield (''in base'') there is a silver sailing ship shown sailing on waves coloured in the actual colours of the sea (''proper''). The [[supporter]] on the "dexter" side (that is, the viewer's left) is a chained wolf, while on the "sinister" side the supporter is a sea-horse. The [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] above the shield is also a sea-horse. These arms date back to 1613, when [[James VI and I]] granted Belfast town status. The seal was used by Belfast merchants throughout the 17th century on their signs and trade-coins.<ref name="Buildings of Belfast">{{cite book | last = Brett | first = C. E. B. | title = Buildings of Belfast, 1700<U+2013>1914 | publisher = Weidenfeld and Nicolson | year= 1967 | location = London}}</ref> A large stained glass window in the [[Belfast City Hall|City Hall]] displays the arms, where an explanation suggests that the seahorse and the ship refer to Belfast's significant maritime history. The wolf may be a tribute to the city's founder, [[Arthur Chichester|Sir Arthur Chichester]], and refer to his own coat of arms.<ref name="Buildings of Belfast"/>

== Geography ==
[[File:Cavehill, Belfast.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cavehill]], a basaltic hill overlooking the city]]
[[File:The Lagan - geograph.org.uk - 190622.jpg|thumb|right|The [[River Lagan]] in Belfast]]
[[File:Belfast, OpenStreetmap, April 2012.png|thumb|right|OpenStreetMap of Belfast]]

The city is flanked to the northwest by a series of hills, including [[Cavehill]]. Belfast is located at the western end of Belfast Lough and at the mouth of the River Lagan making it an ideal location for the shipbuilding industry that once made it famous. When the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'' was built in Belfast in 1911/1912, Harland and Wolff had the largest shipyard in the world.<ref name="Titanic In History">{{cite web | title = Introduction To Titanic <U+2013> Titanic in History | work = Titanic.

Belfast is situated on Northern Ireland's eastern [[coast]] at {{Coord|54|35|49|N|05|55|45|W|}}. A consequence of this northern latitude is that it both endures short winter days and enjoys long summer evenings. During the [[winter solstice]], the shortest day of the year, local sunset is before 16:00 while sunrise is around 08:45. This is balanced by the [[Solstice|summer solstice]] in June, when the sun sets after 22:00 and rises before 05:00.<ref>{{cite web | title = Sunrise and sunset in Belfast | work = Sun Calculator | publisher = time and date.com | url = http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/astronomy.html?n=919| accessdate = 18 May 2007 }}</ref>

In 1994, a [[Lagan Weir|weir]] was built across the river by the [[Laganside Corporation]] to raise the average water level so that it would cover the unseemly mud flats which gave Belfast its name<ref>{{cite web | title = Lagan Weir <U+2013> Why it exists | publisher = Laganside | url = http://www.laganside.com/laganweir.asp | accessdate = 25 May 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070418044643/http://www.laganside.com/laganweir.asp| archivedate= 18 April 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> ({{etymology|ga|B<U+00E9>al Feirste|The sandy ford at the river mouth}}).<ref name="Belfast name"/> The area of Belfast Local Government District is {{convert|42.3|sqmi|km2}}.<ref name=Areameasurements>{{cite web | title = Area Measurements in Northern Ireland | work = 2001 census Data | publisher = Northern Ireland Statistics & Research Agency | year= 2001 | url = http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/census/area_measurement.html | accessdate = 18 May 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070617083217/http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/census/area_measurement.html| archivedate= 17 June 2007 | deadurl= no}}{{dead link|date=May 2014}}</ref>

The [[River Farset]] is also named after this [[silt]] deposit (from the Irish ''feirste'' meaning "sand spit"). Originally a more significant river than it is today, the Farset formed a dock on High Street until the mid 19th century. Bank Street in the [[Belfast City Centre|city centre]] referred to the river bank and Bridge Street was named for the site of an early Farset bridge.<ref>{{cite web | title = Belfast City: Did you know? | work = Discover Ireland | publisher = Tourism Ireland | year= 2007 | url = http://www.discoverireland.com/za/ireland-places-to-go/areas-and-cities/belfast-city/highlights/culture/ | accessdate = 18 May 2007}}{{dead link|date=May 2014}}</ref> Superseded by the River Lagan as the more important river in the city, the Farset now languishes in obscurity, under High Street. There are no less than eleven other minor rivers in and around Belfast, namely the Blackstaff, the Colin, the Connswater, the Cregagh, the Derriaghy, the Forth, the Knock, the Legoniel, the Milewater, the Purdysburn and the Ravernet.<ref>Des O'Reilly, [http://www.colourpointbooks.co.uk/more_details.php?id=1016 Rivers of Belfast <U+2013> A History]</ref>

The city is flanked on the north and northwest by a series of hills, including [[Divis|Divis Mountain]], [[Black Mountain (Belfast)|Black Mountain]] and Cavehill thought to be the inspiration for [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''. When Swift was living at Lilliput Cottage near the bottom of the Limestone Road in Belfast, he imagined that the Cavehill resembled the shape of a sleeping giant safeguarding the city.<ref name="Jonathan Swift">{{cite web | title = Belfast Hills | work = Discover Northern Ireland | publisher = Northern Ireland Tourist Board | url = http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/product.aspx?ProductID=10391 | accessdate = 18 May 2007}}</ref> The shape of the giant's nose, known locally as ''Napoleon's Nose'', is officially called McArt's Fort probably named after Art O'Neill, a 17th-century chieftain who controlled the area at that time.<ref>{{cite web | title = About the Cave Hill | publisher = The Cave Hill Conservation Campaign | year= 2007 | url = http://www.cavehill.freeuk.com/home.htm | accessdate = 25 May 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070206154855/http://www.cavehill.freeuk.com/home.htm |archivedate = 6 February 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> The [[Castlereagh (borough)|Castlereagh]] Hills overlook the city on the southeast.

=== Climate ===

As with the rest of Ireland, Belfast has a [[temperate]] climate, with a narrow range of temperatures and rainfall throughout the year. The climate of Belfast is significantly milder than some other locations in the world at a similar latitude, due to the warming influence of the Gulf Stream. There are currently 5 weather observing stations in the Belfast area: Helens Bay, Stormont, Newforge, Castlereagh, and Ravenhill Road. Slightly further afield is Aldergrove Airport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/networks/images/map3.gif|title=Station Locations|accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref> The highest temperature recorded at any official weather station in the Belfast area was {{convert|30.8|<U+00B0>C|0}} at Shaws Bridge on 12 July 1983.<ref name="Met Office">{{cite web | title = Climate: Northern Ireland | publisher = Met Office | url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/ni/ | accessdate = 25 May 2007}}</ref> Belfast also holds the record for Northern Ireland's warmest night time minimum, {{convert|19.6|<U+00B0>C|1}} at Whitehouse on 14 August 2001.<ref>{{cite web

The nearest weather station for which sunshine data and longer term observations are available is [[Belfast International Airport]] ([[Aldergrove, Northern Ireland|Aldergrove]]).

Belfast expanded very rapidly from being a market town to becoming an industrial city during the course of the 19th century. Because of this, it is less an agglomeration of villages and towns which have expanded into each other, than other comparable cities, such as [[Manchester]] or [[Birmingham]]. The city expanded to the natural barrier of the hills that surround it, overwhelming other settlements. Consequently, the arterial roads along which this expansion took place (such as the [[Falls Road, Belfast|Falls Road]] or the [[Newtownards Road]]) are more significant in defining the districts of the city than nucleated settlements. Belfast remains segregated by walls, commonly known as "[[peace lines]]", erected by the [[British Army]] after August 1969, and which still divide 14 districts in the inner city.<ref name="Peacelines">{{Cite journal | author = Margrethe C.

Belfast city centre is divided into two postcode districts, ''BT1'' for the area lying north of the City Hall, and ''BT2'' for the area to its south. The industrial estate and docklands ''BT3''. The rest of the Belfast [[post town]] is divided in a broadly [[clockwise]] system from ''BT3'' in the north-east round to ''BT15'', with ''BT16'' and ''BT17'' further out to the east and west respectively. Although ''BT'' derives from ''Belfast'', the [[BT postcode area]] extends across the whole of Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite web | title = The UK Postcode System | publisher = List Masters | year= 2005 | url = http://www.listmasters.co.uk/postcodes.php | accessdate = 12 June 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070624020159/http://www.listmasters.co.uk/postcodes.php| archivedate= 24 June 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

Since 2001, boosted by increasing numbers of tourists, the city council has developed a number of cultural [[Belfast quarters|quarters]].

Belfast has been the fastest-growing economy of the thirty largest British cities over the past decade, a new economy report by Howard Spencer has found.

The effect of the economic depression in the Irish Republic on wage levels is not yet fully apparent. The cost of living in Northern Ireland is significantly lower than in the Republic and this has created a retail boom in border towns and cities.

Belfast saw the worst of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, with nearly half of the total deaths in the conflict occurring in the city. However, since the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998, there has been significant [[urban regeneration]] in the city centre including Victoria Square, [[Titanic Quarter, Belfast|Queen's Island]] and [[Laganside]] as well as the Odyssey complex and the landmark [[Waterfront Hall]]. The city is served by two airports: The [[George Best Belfast City Airport]] adjacent to Belfast Lough and [[Belfast International Airport]] which is near [[Lough Neagh]]. [[Queen's University of Belfast]] is the main university in the city. The [[University of Ulster]] also maintains a campus in the city, which concentrates on fine art, design and architecture.

The improvement scheme was completed five months ahead of schedule on February 2009, with the official opening taking place on 4 March 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drdni.gov.uk/index/publications/publications-details.htm?docid=5070|title=The Official Opening of the M1/Westlink Improvement Scheme |publisher=The Department for Regional Development|date=12 March 2009 |accessdate=1 February 2011}}</ref>

Commentators have argued that this may create a bottleneck at York Street, the next [[at-grade intersection]], until that too is upgraded. On 25 October 2012 the stage 2 report for the York Street intersection was approved<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drdni.gov.uk/index/roadimprovements/schemes.htm|title=Road Improvements Schemes <U+2013> In Planning | publisher=The Department for Regional Development NI}}</ref> and in December 2012 the planned upgrade moved into stage 3 of the development process.

[[Hackney carriage|Black taxis]] are common in the city, operating on a [[Share taxi|share]] basis in some areas. These are outnumbered by [[Taxicabs of the United Kingdom#Private hire ('minicabs')|private hire taxis]]. Bus and rail public transport in Northern Ireland is operated by subsidiaries of [[Translink (Northern Ireland)|Translink]]. Bus services in the city proper and the nearer suburbs are operated by [[Metro (Belfast)|Translink Metro]], with services focusing on linking residential districts with the city centre on 12 [[quality bus corridor]]s running along main radial roads, resulting in poor connections between different suburban areas.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

More distant suburbs are served by [[Ulsterbus]]. [[Northern Ireland Railways]] provides [[Belfast Suburban Rail|suburban services]] along three lines running through Belfast's northern suburbs to [[Carrickfergus]], [[Larne]] and [[Larne Harbour railway station|Larne Harbour]], eastwards towards [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]] and south-westwards towards [[Lisburn]] and [[Portadown]]. This service is known as the [[Belfast Suburban Rail]] system. Belfast also has a direct rail connection with [[Dublin]] called ''[[Enterprise (train)|Enterprise]]'' which is operated jointly by NIR and [[Iarnr<U+00F3>d <U+00C9>ireann]], the state railway company of the [[Republic of Ireland]].

In April 2008, the [[Department for Regional Development]] reported on a plan for a light-rail system, similar to that in [[Dublin]]. The consultants said Belfast does not have the population to support a light rail system, suggesting that investment in bus-based rapid transit would be preferable.The study found that bus-based rapid transit produces positive economic results, but light rail does not. The report by Atkins & KPMG, however, said there would be the option of migrating to light rail in the future should the demand increase.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_7330000/newsid_7336800/7336822.stm?bw=bb&mp=wm&news=1&bbcws=1 |title=video No light rail system for city |publisher=BBC News |date= 8 April 2008|accessdate=30 May 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = City to get rapid transit network | work = BBC Northern Ireland | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7335313.stm| accessdate = 4 April 2008 | date=8 April 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080409114158/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7335313.stm| archivedate= 9 April 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

Like all areas of the island of Ireland outside of the [[Gaeltacht]], the Irish language in Belfast is not that of an unbroken intergenerational transmission. Due to community activity in the 1960s, including the establishment of the [[Shaw's Road|Shaws Road Gaeltacht]] community, the expanse in the Irish language arts, and the advancements made in the availability of Irish medium education throughout the city, it can now be said that there is a 'mother-tongue' community of speakers.{{Dubious|date=November 2010}} The language is heavily promoted in the city and is particularly visible in the Falls Road area, where the signs on both the iconic black taxis and on the public buses are bilingual.<ref>[http://www.forbairtfeirste.com/forbairt-news/comharthai-bus-gaeilge-san-iarthar-irish-language-bus-signs-in-the-west/ www.forbairtfeirste.com]</ref> Belfast has the highest concentration of Irish speakers in Northern Ireland.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Projects to promote the language in the city are funded by various sources, notably [[Foras na Gaeilge]], an all-Ireland body funded by both the Irish and British governments. There are a number Irish language Primary schools and one secondary school in Belfast. The provision of certain resources for these schools (for example, such as the provision of textbooks) is supported by the charitable organisation TACA.
