The '''4th Boat Race''' took place on the [[River Thames]] on 15 April 1840.  It was the third of the University Boat Races to be held on the Thames, between Westminster Bridge and Putney Bridge.  [[Oxford University Boat Club]] was formed to assist in the selection of the Oxford crew. Nevertheless, Cambridge won the race by three-quarters of a length to lead the overall record at 3&ndash;1.

==Background==
[[The Boat Race]] is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] competition between the [[University of Oxford]] (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues")<ref name=blues>{{Cite web | url = http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/apr/06/theobserver | work = [[The Observer]] | title = Dark Blues aim to punch above their weight | date = 6 April 2003 | accessdate = 1 September 2014 }}</ref> and the [[University of Cambridge]] (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues").<ref name=blues/>  The race was first held in 1829, and takes place on the [[River Thames]] in southwest London.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/london/10719622/University-Boat-Race-2014-spectators-guide.html | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate = 1 September 2014 | date = 25 March 2014 |title = University Boat Race 2014: spectators' guide | first = Oliver |last =Smith}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/the-course | title = The Course| accessdate = 1 September 2014 | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited}}</ref>

Following heavy defeats in the [[The Boat Race 1836|1836]] and [[The Boat Race 1839|1839 races]], and in order to improve the selection of the crew, [[Oxford University Boat Club]] was formed on 23 April 1839,<ref>Burnell, p. 4</ref> to which anyone at the university could subscribe and which was governed by the various college boat club captains.<ref>MacMichael, p. 69</ref>  The initial letter of challenge was delivered to Cambridge from Oxford in February.  After considerable discussion, mainly centred around the restriction of crew selection to undergraduates only, the date of the race, 15 April 1840,<ref name= early>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/report/early-races | title = Boat Race &ndash; Early races| publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited| accessdate = 22 April 2014}}</ref> was agreed sixteen days prior to the race itself.<ref>MacMichael, pp. 69&ndash;70</ref>  The umpires for the race were Calverley Bewicke (for Oxford) and [[Charles Jasper Selwyn]] (for Cambridge), while W. H. Harrison, the Commodore of the [[Royal Thames Yacht Club]], was the referee.<ref>Burnell p. 49</ref>  The race was to take place on a five-and-three-quarter-mile (9.2&nbsp;km) stretch of the Thames between [[Westminster Bridge]] and [[Putney Bridge]].<ref name=ox>{{Cite web |url = http://www.ox.ac.uk/about_the_university/university_year/the_boat_race/ | publisher = [[Oxford University Boat Club]] | title = The Boat Race | accessdate = 22 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | publisher = [[British History Online]] | title = Putney | accessdate = 29 October 2014 | url = http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43035}}</ref>

== Race ==
[[File:Putney Bridge in the morning.jpg|right|thumb|Putney Bridge marked the finish of the 1840 Boat Race.]]
Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Middlesex side of the river, handing the Surrey side to Cambridge.<ref name=dodd287/>  The race commenced from below [[Westminster Bridge]] at 1.30pm, with Edward Searle acting as the starter.<ref name=mac71/>  With a number of steamers blocking the route, Oxford made a good start and took an early lead.  The wake of the steamers caused rough water in which both crews struggled to maintain a consistent rhythm.  The lead had extended by the time the crews passed below [[Vauxhall Bridge#Old Vauxhaull Bridge|Vauxhall Bridge]] and was nearly three lengths by the Spread Eagle pub.  At this point Cambridge began to reduce the deficit, but following a warning from [[Robert Coombes]] who was steering the umpire's boat ''Dolphin'', Oxford's cox Garnett steered across the path of Cambridge.  The Light Blues maintained their course and Oxford were forced back again.  By the Red House, Cambridge had restored parity and started to pull away.  Despite suffering further rough water from the wake of another steamer at [[Battersea Bridge]], Cambridge maintained their lead and passed through the centre arch of [[Putney Bridge]] three-quarters of a length ahead of Oxford.<ref>MacMichael, pp. 72&ndash;74</ref>  The winning time was 29 minutes 3 seconds, and the victory took the overall lead to 3&ndash;1 in favour of Cambridge.<ref name=dodd287/><ref name=results>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/results| publisher= The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Boat Race <U+2013> Results| accessdate = 26 October 2014}}</ref>
