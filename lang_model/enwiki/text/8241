A '''winter service vehicle''' ('''WSV'''), also known as a '''snow removal unit''' or '''snow removal vehicle''', is a [[vehicle]] used to perform [[snow removal]], the clearing of roads or other thoroughfares of [[ice]] or [[snow]], which is difficult to cross and reduces the [[traction (engineering)|traction]] of [[motor vehicle]]s.<ref name="highways">{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/knowledge/2244.aspx|title=Winter Driving|publisher=[[Highways Agency]]|accessdate=2007-02-08}}</ref> Winter service vehicles are usually based on [[dump truck]] chassis, with adaptations allowing them to carry specially designed snow removal equipment, although many authorities also keep a number of smaller vehicles for use on [[Sidewalk|pavements]], [[footpath]]s and [[cycleway]]s. Road maintenance agencies and contractors in areas with [[temperate]] or [[polar climate]]s often own multiple winter service vehicles in order to keep the road network clear of snow and ice and safe for driving during the [[winter]] months.<ref name="Europe">{{cite book|title=Report on the 1998 scanning review of European winter service technology|author=[[United States National Research Council]]|publisher=[[Transportation Research Board]]|year=1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Winter Maintenance Technology and Practices - Learning from Abroad|date=[[9 February]] [[1995]]|author=[[United States National Research Council]]|publisher=[[Transportation Research Board]]}}</ref> Winter service vehicles are also employed by [[airport]]s, in order to keep [[runway]]s and taxiways free of snow and ice, which pose a danger to aircraft [[takeoff|taking off]] and [[landing]] and can interfere with communication equipment.<ref name="dresden">{{cite web|url=http://www.dresden-airport.de/en/struktur/presse/pressemitteilungen/pmDetail.html?id=567|title=Once around the world: Dresden Airport's Winter Service covered about 40,000 km|publisher=[[Dresden Airport]]|date=[[19 April]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-02-09}}.</ref>

The earliest winter service vehicles were snow rollers, designed to maintain a smooth, even road surface for [[sled]]s,<ref name="ala">{{cite web|url=http://islandnet.com/~see/weather/almanac/arc_1999/alm99dec.htm|title=Moving The Snow|publisher=Weather Almanac for December 1999|accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref> although [[Horse-drawn vehicle|horse-drawn]] [[snowplough]]s and gritting vehicles are recorded in use as early as 1862.<ref name="shovel">{{cite web|url=http://nsidc.colorado.edu/snow/shovel.html|title=Have Snow Shovel, Will Travel|first=Laura|last=Cheshire|publisher=[[National Snow and Ice Data Center]]|accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref> The increase in motor car traffic and [[aviation]] in the early 20th century lead to the development and popularisation of large motorised winter service vehicles. Today, most cities in areas prone to snow or ice operate fleets of winter service vehicles to keep roads and footpaths safe and clear. 

==History==
[[Image:Schneepflug pferdzug.jpg|thumb|left|An early horse-drawn snowplough at the Rosstag Burggen, a [[historical reenactment]] of life in 19th century [[Germany]].<ref name="Rosstag">{{cite web|url=http://www.rosstag-burggen.de/|title=Ein Fest f<U+00FC>r Pferdefreunde|publisher=Rosstag Burggen|language=German|accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref>]]
Although the concept of snow removal has existed since at least the [[Middle Ages]], early attempts merely involved using a [[shovel]] or broom to remove the snow from walkways and roads.<ref name="shovel"/> Before the invention of motorised transport, snow removal was seen as less of a concern: the unpaved roads present in rural areas were dangerous and bumpy; snow and ice made the surface far smoother. Most farmers could simply replace their wagons with [[sled]]s, allowing the transport of heavy materials such as timber with relative ease.<ref name="ala"/> Early communities in the northern regions of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] even used [[Animal powered transport|animal-drawn]] snow rollers, the earliest winter service vehicles, to compress the snow covering roads. The compression increased the life of the snow and increased the ease of passage for sleds; some communities even employed snow wardens, whose job it was to spread or "pave" snow onto areas which were still exposed such as bridges to allow the sleds to use these routes.<ref name="ala"/>

However, with the increase in [[Pavement (material)|paved roads]] and the increasing size of cities, the process of snow-paving fell out of favour, as the smooth surfaces produced posed a danger to pedestrians and traffic. The earliest [[patent]]s for snowploughs date back to 1840, but there are no records of their actual use until 1862, when the city of [[Milwaukee]] began operating horse-drawn carts fitted with [[snowplough]]s.<ref name="shovel"/> The horse-drawn snowplough quickly spread to other cities, especially those in areas prone to heavy snowfall.

The first motorised snowploughs were developed in 1913, based on truck and [[tractor]] bodies, while the earliest [[snow blower]], the Barber-Green snowloader, was invented in 1920. These machines allowed the mechanisation of the snow clearing process, reducing the labour required for snow removal and increasing the speed and efficiency of the process.<ref name="shovel"/> The expansion of the [[aviation]] industry also acted as a catalyst for the development of winter service vehicles during the early 20th century: as even a light dusting of snow or ice could cause an aeroplane to crash, large fences were erected around airfields to prevent [[snowdrift]]s forming and airports began to maintain fleets of winter service vehicles to keep the runways clear in heavy weather.<ref name="shovel"/>

With the popularisation of the [[motor car]], it was found that ploughing alone was insufficient for removing all snow and ice from the roadway, leading to the development of [[Winter service vehicle#Gritter|gritting vehicles]], which used [[sodium chloride]] to accelerate the melting of the snow.<ref name="shovel"/> Early attempts at gritting were resisted, as the salt used encouraged rusting, causing damage to the metal structures of bridges and the shoes of pedestrians. However, as the number of [[car crash|motoring accidents]] increased, the protests subsided and by 1925 many cities in the United States used salt and sand to improve clear the roads and increase road safety.<ref name="shovel"/> However, as [[environmentalism|environmental awareness]] increased through the 1960s and 1970s, gritting once again fell out of favour as the environmental impact of grit was discovered, leading to the development of alternative de-icing chemicals and more efficient spreading systems.<ref name="shovel"/>

Winter service vehicles are usually based on dump truck [[chassis]], which are then converted into winter service vehicles either by the manufacturer or an [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] third-party. A typical modification involves replacement of [[steel]] components of the vehicle with corrosion resistant [[aluminium]] or [[fibreglass]], waterproofing any exposed [[electronic]] components, replacement of the stock hopper with a specially designed gritting body, the addition of a plough frame, reinforcement of the [[Bumper (automobile)|bumpers]] to support the heavy blade and the addition of extra [[headlamp]]s, a [[light bar]] and [[retroreflector]]s for visibility.<ref name="Schofield">{{cite web|url=http://www.shofieldsscrapmetal.co.uk/gritting_contractors/history_of_gritting/|title=Gritting Contractors : History Of Gritting|publisher=Schofield of Huddersfield|accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref> Other common changes include the replacement of the stock tyres with [[rain tire|rain tyres]] or mud and snow tyres and the shortening of the vehicle's [[wheelbase]] to improve manoeuvrability.<ref name="Scho2">{{cite web|url=http://www.shofieldsscrapmetal.co.uk/gritting_contractors/vehicles/|title=Gritting Contractors : Vehicles|publisher=Schofield of Huddersfield|accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref> However, some winter service vehicles, especially those designed for use on footpaths or [[car-free zone|pedestrianised zones]], are built on a far smaller chassis. These vehicles are often multi-purpose, and can be fitted with other equipment such as brushes, lawnmowers or cranes, allowing the vehicles to be used even in warm or dry weather and reducing the size of the fleet required by the agency or contractor.<ref name="multicar">{{cite web|url=http://www.multicar.de/multicar/frontend/index.php4?pre_cat_open=535|title=Flexible applications|publisher=[[Multicar]]|accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref> Modern winter service vehicles will usually also have a [[satellite navigation]] system connected to a [[Weather forecasting|weather forecast]] feed, allowing the driver to choose the best areas to treat and to avoid areas in which rain is likely, which can wash away the grit used.<ref name="shovel"/> [[Military]] winter service vehicles are heavily armoured to allow for their use in combat zones, especially in [[Arctic warfare|Arctic]] and [[mountain warfare]], and often based on [[combat bulldozer]]s or [[High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle|HMMWV]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/pls/erdcpub/docs/erdc/images/HMMWV_snowplow.pdf|title=High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle Snowplow|publisher=[[United States Army Corps of Engineers]]|format=[[PDF]]|accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref> Military winter service vehicles have been used by the [[United Nations]], [[Kosovo Force]] and the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in [[Central Europe]] during the [[Kosovo War]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crrel.usace.army.mil/techpub/CRREL_Reports/reports/SR02-1.pdf|title=Snow and Ice Control (SNIC) Equipment and Its Use by Military Units Worldwide|publisher=[[United States Army Corps of Engineers]]|format=[[PDF]]|accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref> while during the [[Cold War]], the [[Royal Marines]] and [[Royal Corps of Signals]] deployed a number of tracked vehicles in [[Norway]] to patrol the [[NATO]] border with the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.4x4uk.org/faq/index.php?sid=125100&lang=en&action=artikel&cat=11&id=29&artlang=en|title= Aktiv Snow-Trac Info|publisher=4x4 UK|accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.army.mod.uk/royalsignalsmuseum/displays/post_ww2_conflicts/un_peace_keeping_forces.htm|title= United Nations and NATO Peace Keeping|publisher=[[Royal Corps of Signals]]|accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref>

Most winter service vehicles run on wheels, often with [[snow chain]]s or studded tyres,<ref name="Europe"/> but some are mounted on [[caterpillar track]]s, with the tracks themselves adapted to throw the snow towards the side of the road.<ref>{{US patent reference|number=4174578|y=1979|m=11|d=20|inventor=Bernardino Grillo|title=Tracked Snowplow}}</ref> [[Off-road]] winter service vehicles mounted on caterpillar tracks are known as [[snowcat]]s.

In most countries, winter service vehicles usually have amber light bars, which are activated to indicate that the vehicle is operating below the local [[speed limit]] or otherwise poses a danger to other traffic, either by straddling multiple lanes<ref name="Schofield"/> or by spreading grit or de-icer,<ref name="highways"/> although in some areas, such as the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Ontario]], winter service vehicles use the blue flashing lights associated with [[emergency service vehicle]]s, rather than the amber or orange used elsewhere.<ref name="HTAO">{{cite web|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/DBLaws/Statutes/English/90h08_e.htm#62.(31)|title=Ontario Highway Traffic Act R.S.O. 1990, CHAPTER H.8 section 62-31|publisher=[[Politics of Ontario|Government of Ontario]] e-Laws website|accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref> Many agencies also paint their vehicles in high-contrast orange or yellow to allow the vehicles to been seen more clearly in [[whiteout (weather)|whiteout]] conditions.

==Operation==
[[Image:Salt shed.jpg|thumb|left|A salt barn near [[Lake Michigan]], used for storing grit and providing limited accommodation for gritter drivers during winter storms.]]
Winter service vehicles are operated by both government agencies and by private [[subcontractor]]s.<ref name="Europe"/> [[Public works]] in areas which regularly receive snowfall usually maintain a fleet of their own vehicles or pay [[retainer]]s to contractors for priority access to vehicles in winter, while cities where snow is a less regular occurrence may simply hire the vehicles as needed.<ref name="edmonton">{{cite news|url= http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=dc3a800b-634c-4a62-aa6c-1eb7dd5747ed&k=69943 |title=City may ante up to ensure snow plowing|publisher=[[Edmonton Journal]]|date=[[April 14]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref> Winter service vehicles in the [[United Kingdom]] are the only road-going vehicles entitled to use [[red diesel]], as although the vehicles still use public highways, they are used to keep the road network operational; forcing them to pay extra tax in order to do so would discourage private contractors from assisting with snow removal on public roads.<ref>{{cite press release | title = Summary of Responses: Hydrocarbon oil duty - consultation on changes to Excepted Vehicle Schedule | publisher = [[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs]] | date = [[5 December]] [[2005]] | url = http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&propertyType=document&columns=1&id=HMCE_PROD1_024841 | format = <U+00A7><U+00A7>5.22-24 |accessdate =2007-04-20}}</ref> Winter service vehicle drivers in the United States must hold a [[commercial driver's license#CDL Class Definitions|Class B or Class A]] [[commercial driver's license]],<ref name="Go">{{cite web|url=http://www.go-explore-trans.org/2007/jan-feb/snowplowsim.cfm|title=Learning to drive a snowplow|first=Michele|last=Regenold|publisher=''Go!'' - [[Iowa State University]]|accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref> while in the [[European Union]], drivers must have a [[Driver's license#Categories valid in all EU countries|Category C]] [[Large Goods Vehicle]] licence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/business/documents/MAC_Model_SI_Annex_07_Final_Dec_06.pdf|title=MAC Model Contract|publisher=[[Highways Agency]]|accessdate=2007-04-20|pages=A7-5}}</ref> Although some agencies in some areas, such as the [[U.S. state]] of [[Minnesota]], allow winter service vehicle drivers to operate without any extra training,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salary.com/careers/layouthtmls/crel_display_Cat10_Ser22_Par53.html|title= Dream Job: Snowplow Driver|publisher=salary.com|first=Amy|last=Furan|accessdate=2007-04-23}}</ref> most provide supplemental lessons to drivers in order to teach them the most effective and safe methods of snow removal; many require that trainee drivers ride-along with more experienced drivers, and some even operate specially designed [[driving simulator]]s, which can safely replicate dangerous winter driving conditions.<ref name="Go"/>

Winter service vehicle drivers usually work [[part time]], before and during inclement weather only, with drivers working a 12 to 16 hour shift.<ref name="Go"/><ref name="magazine">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6342887.stm|title=How do snowplough drivers get to work?|publisher=[[BBC News Magazine Monitor]]|date=[[8 February]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-02-08}}</ref> Main roads are typically gritted in advance, in order to reduce the disruption to the network.<ref name="magazine"/> Salt barns are provided at regular intervals for drivers to collect more grit, and bedding is provided at depots for drivers to use between shifts in heavy or prolonged storms.<ref name="magazine"/>

Weather conditions typically vary greatly depending on altitude; hot countries can experience heavy snowfall in mountainous regions yet receive very little in low-lying areas, increasing the accident rate among drivers inexperienced in winter driving. In addition, road surface temperatures can fall rapidly at higher altitudes, precipitating rapid [[frost]] formation. As a result, gritting and ploughing runs are often prioritised in favour of clearing these mountain roads, especially at the start and end of the snow season.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/circulars/ec063.pdf|pages=pp. 414-421|format=[[PDF]]|title=Sixth International Symposium on Snow Removal and Ice Control|accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref> The hazardous roads through mountain passes pose additional problems for the large winter service vehicles; the heavy metal frame and bulky grit makes hill climbing very demanding for the vehicle, requiring that the vehicle have extremely high torque [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] systems to provide enough power to make the climb,<ref name="Schofield"/> while the tight [[hairpin turn]]s found on mountain slopes are difficult for long vehicles to navigate, requiring that winter service vehicles for use in mountainous areas are shortened, usually from six wheels to four.<ref name="Scho2"/>

==Equipment==
===De-icer===
{{main|de-icing}}
[[Image:Aircraft Deicing Syracuse.jpg|thumb|left|A de-icing vehicle treating an [[American Airlines]] [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80/MD-90|MD-80]] at [[Syracuse Hancock International Airport]], [[New York]].]]
De-icers spray heated [[de-icing fluid]], often [[propylene glycol]] or [[ethylene glycol]], onto icy surfaces such as the bodies of aircraft and road surfaces.<ref name="Dresden2">{{cite web|url= http://www.dresden-airport.de/en/struktur/presse/pressemitteilungen/pmDetail.html?id=385|title=Winter service team at Dresden Airport ready for the cold season|publisher=[[Dresden Airport]]|date=[[29 October]] [[2004]]|accessdate=2007-02-09}}</ref> These prevent ice from forming on the body of the aircraft while on the ground. Ice makes the surface of the wings rougher, reducing the amount of lift they provide. Ice also increases the weight of the aircraft and can affect its balance.

Aircraft de-icing vehicles usually consist of a large [[tanker truck]], containing the concentrated de-icing fluid, with a water feed to dilute the fluid according to the ambient temperature. The vehicle also normally has a [[cherry picker]] crane, allowing the operator to spray the entire aircraft in as little time as possible; an entire [[Boeing 737]] can be treated in under 10 minutes by a single de-icing vehicle.<ref name="Dresden2"/>

Some road contractors also choose to use de-icers as an alternative to gritters; the vehicle carries a tank of [[brine]], which is sprayed on the road surface. Brine acts faster than solid salt and does not require compression by passing traffic to become effective. The brine is also more environmentally friendly, as less salt is required to treat the same length of road.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gritty Gritty Bang Bang!|last=Kengt|first=Ann-Marie|publisher=Local Authority Plants and Vehicles Magazine|date=October 2005}}</ref> Airport runways are also de-iced by sprayers fitted with long spraying arms. These arms are wide enough to cross the entire runway, and allow de-icing of the entire airstrip to take place in a single pass, reducing the length of time that the runway is unavailable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schmidt-automotive.com/holding/english/products/airport/airside/ice/sprayers/sprayers-nozzle.php| title=Airside nozzle sprayers|publisher=Schmidt Automotive|accessdate=2007-02-10}}</ref>

===Gritter===
[[Image:Schneepflug Strasse hinten.jpg|thumb|right|The hopper and [[impeller]] of a gritter in [[Germany]].]]
A gritter, also known as a sander,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=34540&dict=CALD|title=Cambridge Dictionary definition: Gritter|publisher=''[[Cambridge University Press]]''|accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref> salt spreader or salt truck,<ref name="highways"/> is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously.<ref name="magazine"/> Gritters are used to spread grit, a mixture of [[sand]] and [[halite|rock salt]], onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, and spread across the roadway by an [[impeller]]. Salt reduces the melting point of ice by [[freezing-point depression]], causing it to melt at lower temperatures and run off harmlessly to the edge of the road, while sand increases traction by increasing [[friction]] between car [[tyre]]s and roadways. The amount of salt dropped varies with the condition of the road; to prevent the formation of light ice, approximately 10&nbsp;[[gram]]s per [[square metre]] (0.3&nbsp;[[ounce|oz]]/[[square yard|yd<U+00B2>]]) is dropped, while thick snow can require up to 40&nbsp;g/m<U+00B2> (1.2&nbsp;oz/yd<U+00B2>) of salt, independent of the volume of sand dropped.<ref name="ICE">{{cite book|title=Highway Winter Maintenance: ICE Design and Practice Guide|publisher=Thomas Telford|others=''[[Institution of Civil Engineers]]''|year=2000|isbn=0727729578}}</ref> The grit is sometimes mixed with [[molasses]] to help adhesion to the road surface. However, the sweet molasses often attracts livestock, who lick the road and can become addicted to the sugar.<ref name="sheep">{{cite news|url=http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_2181287.html|title=New road grit popular - with sheep|publisher=[[Ananova]]|accessdate=2007-02-09}}</ref> The grit is sometimes heated as it is passed out of the nozzle; this helps melt the ice and improves the [[solubility]] of the salt. Quieter rural roads may be considered too minor to grit, so [[grit bin]]s are often provided, containing a mixture of sand and salt for drivers and pedestrians to shovel onto the road themselves.

Gritters are among the winter service vehicles also used in airports, to keep runways free of ice. However, the salt normally used to clear roads can damage the [[airframe]] of aircraft and interferes with the sensitive navigation equipment. As a result, airport gritters spread less dangerous [[potassium acetate]] onto the runways instead, as potassium acetate does not corrode the aircraft or the airside equipment.<ref name="Dresden2"/>

The salt dropped by gritters comes from a [[renewable|non-renewable]] source, and high concentrations of salt in soil kill plants, so it is in the interest of operators to limit gritting to an absolute minimum. As a result, road maintenance agencies have advanced networks of ice prediction stations, to prevent unnecessary gritting which not only wastes salt, but can damage the environment and disrupt traffic.<ref name="GNN">{{cite news|url=http://www.gnn.gov.uk/content/detail.asp?NewsAreaID=2&ReleaseID=138214|title=New facilities help guard against winter|publisher=[[Government News Network]]|date=[[3 December]] [[2004]]|accessdate=2007-02-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warrington.gov.uk/traffic/gritting.asp|title=Winter Highway Gritting|publisher=[[Warrington Borough Council]]|accessdate=2007-02-08}}</ref> The salt dropped is eventually washed away and lost, so it cannot be reused or collected after gritting runs, although the insoluble sand can be collected and recycled by [[Street sweeper|street sweeping vehicles]] and mixed with new salt crystals to be reused in later batches of grit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.estesnet.com/PublicWorks/Streets/|title=Street Department|publisher=[[Estes Park, Colorado|Town of Estes Park]]|accessdate=2007-04-19}}</ref> As a result, operators must regularly purchase large quantities of rock salt, depleting a finite resource and damaging the environment through dangerous and polluting [[salt mining]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/NR/exeres/D7AE7E88-6627-4495-B326-EBCEE505406E,frameless.htm?wbc_purpose=Basic&WBCMODE=PresentationUnpublished%23%23%23%23?PageVersion=PRINTERFRIENDLY| title=Minerals Local Plan - Chapter 9|publisher=[[Cheshire County Council]]|accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref> In some areas of the world, including [[Berlin]], dropping salt is prohibited altogether, except on the highest-risk roads; plain sand, without any melting agents, is spread instead.

Gritters can also be used in hot weather, when temperatures are high enough to melt the [[bitumen]] used in [[asphalt]]. The grit is dropped to provide a protective layer between the road surface and the tyres of passing vehicles, which would otherwise damage the road surface by "plucking out" the bitumen-coated [[Aggregate (composite)|aggregate]] from the road surface.<ref name="summer">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/4674893.stm|title=Gritters to combat melting roads|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[July 12]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-02-08}}</ref>

With the development of more advanced electronic systems in the 1980s allowed manufacturers to produce snow groomers which could work on and replicate a much wider range of terrains, with the most modern even able to produce [[half-pipe]]s and [[Mini ramp|ramps]] for snowboarding.<ref name="NewHam"/> Snow groomers are also used in conjunction with [[snow cannon]]s, in order to ensure that the snow produced is spread evenly across the resort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://travel.howstuffworks.com/snow-maker2.htm|title=How Snow Makers Work|publisher=[[HowStuffWorks]]|first=Tom|last=Harris|accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref> However, snow groomers have a detrimental effect on the environment within the resort; grooming removes nutrients and minerals from the soil underneath the snow and the regular pressure from the grooming vehicle increases the [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] rate of the soil while decreasing the [[field capacity]], thereby increasing the rate at which water can soak through the soil, making it more prone to [[erosion]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Nature-Based Tourism, Environment, and Land Management|first=Ralph|last=Buckley|coauthors=Pickering, Catherine; Weaver, David Bruce;|date=2003|publisher=CAB International|isbn=0851997325}}</ref>

===Snow melter===
{{seealso|Metromelt}}
[[Image:Snow melter.jpg|thumb|left|Snow melters working at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]], [[New York]].]]
A snow melting vehicle works by scooping snow into a melting pit located in a large tank at the rear of the vehicle. Around the melting pit is a smaller tank full of boiling water, heated by a powerful burner. The gases from the burner are bubbled through the water, causing some of the water to spill over into the melting pit, melting the snow instantly. The meltwater is discharged into the [[storm drain]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snowmelter.com/principle.html|title=Principle of Operation|publisher=Trecan Combustion|accessdate=2007-02-09}}</ref>

As they have to carry the large water tank and fuel for the burner. snow melting machines tend to be much larger and heavier than most winter service vehicles, at around {{m to ft|18|wiki=yes}}, with the largest being hauled by [[semi-trailer truck|semi-trailer]] [[tractor unit]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snowmelter.com/500pd.html|title=500-PD specifications|publisher=Trecan Combustion|accessdate=2007-02-09}}</ref> In addition, the complicated melting process means that snow melting vehicles have a much lower capacity than the equivalent plough or blower vehicle; the largest snow melter can remove 500 tonnes of snow per hour, compared to the 5000 tonnes per hour capacity of any large snow blower.<ref name="Blower"/> However, snow melters are far more environmentally friendly than gritters, as they do not spray hazardous materials, and pollutants from the road surface can be separated from the meltwater and disposed of safely. In addition, as the snow is melted on board, the costs of removing the collected snow from the site is removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snowmelter.com/economics.html|title=Economics of Snow Melting|publisher=Trecan Combustion|accessdate=2007-02-09}}</ref>

===Snowplough===
{{main|snowplough}}
[[Image:Schneepflug Strasse vorne.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Germany|German]] snowplough with a hopper for carrying grit.]]
Many winter service vehicles can be fitted with snowploughs, in order to clear roads which are blocked by deep snow. Most winter service vehicles include either permanently fixed ploughs or plough frames: 75% of the UK's [[Highways Agency]] vehicles include a plough frame to which a blade can be attached.<ref name="magazine"/> In most cases, the ploughs are mounted on [[hydraulics|hydraulically]]-actuated arms, allowing them to be raised, lowered, and angled to better move snow. In the event that specially designed winter service vehicles are not available for ploughing, other service or [[construction vehicle]]s can be used instead: among those used by various authorities are [[grader]]s,<ref name="edmonton"/> [[bulldozer]]s,<ref name="George">{{cite web|url=http://www.city.pg.bc.ca/city_services/transportation/snowoperations/|title=Transportation Division - Snow Operations|publisher=[[Prince George City Council|City of Prince George]]|accessdate=2007-04-18}}</ref> [[skid loader]]s,<ref name="Wash-Jeff">{{cite web|url=http://www.washjeff.edu/uploadedFiles/Physical_Plant/2005-2006%20W&J%20Snow%20Plan.pdf|title= Washington and Jefferson College snow response plan|format=[[PDF]]|publisher=[[Washington and Jefferson College]]|accessdate=2007-04-18}}</ref> and [[rubbish truck]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home2.nyc.gov/html/dsny/html/pr2006/110906.shtml|title= Sanitation to begin winter night plow schedule|publisher=[[New York City Department of Sanitation]]|date=[[November 9]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-04-18}}</ref> [[Front-end loader]]s can also be used to plough snow: they can use a snowplough attachment which mounts on the loader's arm in place of the bucket, or they can use their bucket or snowbasket to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplough or dump truck which then hauls it away.<ref>{{US patent reference|number=5129169|y=1992|m=07|d=14|inventor=Aubichon Andre|title=Attachment for snow removal}}</ref> Snowploughs are dangerous to [[overtaking|overtake]]; often, the oncoming lane may not be completely free of snow. In addition, the plough blade causes considerable spray of snow on both sides, which can obscure the vision of other road users.<ref name="highways"/>

===Surface friction tester===
The surface friction tester is a small fifth wheel attached to a hydraulic system mounted on the rear axle of the vehicle, canted slightly relative to the ground, generally used at airports and on major roadways before ice formation.<ref name="MK IV">{{cite web|url=http://www.asft.se/aviation/MKrear.html|title=MK IV rear axle system|publisher=Airport Surface Friction Testers|accessdate=2007-02-09}}</ref> The wheel is allowed to turn freely, allowing sensors attached to the axis of the wheel to calculate the friction between the wheel and the driving surface by the measuring the [[torque]] produced by the rotation of the wheel. The vehicle can relay the surface friction data back to the control centre, allowing gritting and clearing routes to be planned so that the vehicles are deployed most efficiently.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.dresden-airport.de/en/reisende_und_besucher/willkommen/wie_funktioniert/winterdienst/enteiser.html|title= Aircraft De-icing|publisher=[[Dresden Airport]]|accessdate=2007-02-09}}</ref> Surface friction testers often include a water spraying system, in order to simulate the effects of rain on the road surface before the rain occurs.<ref name="MK IV"/> The sensors are usually mounted to small [[Compact car|compact]] or [[estate car]]s or to a small [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailer]], rather than the large trucks used for other winter service equipment, as the surface friction tester works best when attached to lightweight vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asft.se/road/VWSharan.html|title=ASFT VW Sharan Road Surface Friction Tester|publisher=Airport Surface Friction Testers|accessdate=2007-04-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asft.se/road/t10Trailer.html|title=ASFT T-10 Trailer Road Surface Friction Tester|publisher=Airport Surface Friction Testers|accessdate=2007-04-19}}</ref><ref name="MK IV"/>
