In 2003, he won a [[Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] [[Grammy Award]] for "[[Your Body Is a Wonderland]]".

Mayer began his career performing mainly acoustic [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]], but gradually began a transition towards the [[blues]] genre in 2005 by collaborating with renowned blues artists such as [[B. B. King]], [[Buddy Guy]], and [[Eric Clapton]], and by forming the [[John Mayer Trio]]. The blues influence can be heard on his album ''[[Continuum (album)|Continuum]]'', released in September 2006. At the [[49th Annual Grammy Awards]] in 2007 Mayer won [[Best Pop Vocal Album]] for ''Continuum'' and [[Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] for "[[Waiting on the World to Change]]".
Mayer's career pursuits have extended to [[stand-up comedy]], design, and writing; he has written pieces for magazines, most notably for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''.

By the end of 2002, ''Room for Squares'' had spawned several radio hits, including "No Such Thing," "[[Your Body Is a Wonderland]]," and ultimately, "[[Why Georgia]]." In 2003, Mayer won a Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] for "Your Body Is a Wonderland." In his acceptance speech he remarked, "This is very, very fast, and I promise to catch up."<ref>Bream, Jon (2007).

In 2003, Mayer released a live CD and DVD of a concert in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] entitled, ''[[Any Given Thursday]]''. The concert featured songs previously not recorded, such as "Man on the Side" (co-written with Cook) and "[[Something's Missing]]", which later appeared on ''[[Heavier Things]]''.

Commercially, the album quickly peaked at number seventeen on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart. The CD/DVD received conservative, although consistent, praise, with critics torn between his pop-idol image, and (at the time) emerging guitar prowess. Erik Crawford (of [[Allmusic]]) asked "Is he the consummate guitar hero exemplified when he plays a cover of Stevie Ray Vaughan's 'Lenny', or is he the teen idol that the pubescent girls shriek for after he plays 'Your Body Is a Wonderland?'"<ref>Crawford, Erik (2003).

''[[Heavier Things]]'', Mayer's second album, was released in 2003 to generally favorable reviews.

He accompanied [[Alicia Keys]] on guitar on her song "[[No One (Alicia Keys song)|No One]]" at the ceremony.

In February 2008, Mayer hosted a three-day Caribbean cruise event that included performances with various musicians including [[David Ryan Harris]], [[Brett Dennen]], and [[Colbie Caillat]], among others. The event was called "The Mayercraft Carrier" and was held aboard the cruise ship known as the ''[[Carnival Victory]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mayercraftcarrier.com/artists.html|publisher=Mayercraft.com|accessdate=2007-09-26|title=Mayercraft Carrier Cruise :: February 1-4, 2008 :: A John Mayer/Sixthman Experience}}</ref> A follow up cruise titled "Mayercraft Carrier 2" has already been arranged [[March 27]]-[[March 31|31]], [[2009]] on the [[Carnival Splendor]] and will set sail from [[Long Beach, California]].

On [[July 1]], [[2008]], Mayer released ''[[Where the Light Is]]'' a live concert film directed by Danny Clinch. The concert was filmed at the Nokia Theatre [[L.A. Live]] on December 8, 2007. It features an acoustic set, a set with the John Mayer Trio, followed by a set with John's band from the ''Continuum'' album. The film was released on DVD and Blu-Ray disc formats, along with a two-disc CD and [[LP album|LP vinyl]]. The DVD and Bluray versions feature several "backstage" sections between songs and sets. Some of these were not filmed in the time backstage, but prior or after the concert throughout Los Angeles. Preceding the concert, Mayer is also seen on Mulholland Dr playing his guitar with Los Angeles in the background. The full version of this performance is also included as a special feature, known as ''Slow Burning on Mulholland Drive''.<ref>[http://www.johnmayer.com/news#2 "where the light is" live album is released today.].

==Other projects==
===Philanthropic activities===
In 2002, Mayer began the "Back To You" Fund, a non-profit organization that focuses on fundraising in the areas of health care, education, the arts, and talent development. The foundation raises funds through the auction of exclusive John Mayer items, such as guitar picks, t-shirts, and signed CDs, made available on Mayer's auction site.

In a ''Rolling Stone'' interview, Mayer recalled that after former Columbia Records head, [[Don Ienner]], panned ''Continuum'', he briefly considered quitting music and studying design full time.<!-- However, he soon wrote "Waiting on the World to Change," thus reinvigorating both the album and his music career.--><ref name=RS06/> Mayer's interest in design, however, had long manifested itself in a number of ways. In 2003, [[Martin Guitars]] gave Mayer his own signature model acoustic guitar called the OM-28 John Mayer.<ref name=OM-28>(2003).

In January, 2006, [[Martin Guitars]] released the Martin OMJM John Mayer acoustic guitar.

Not surprisingly, Mayer is a passionate collector of guitars, and in 2006 his collection was estimated at more than 200.<ref name=RS06/>

In addition to guitars, Mayer's handiwork ranges from T-shirts, guitar totes and, most dear to his heart, sneakers. In August 2006, Mayer started JMltd, a minor clothing line of Mayer-themed merchandise that he has designed. The products are currently available online through his website store.

===Writing===
With the [[June 1]], [[2004]], issue of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', Mayer began a column called, "Music Lessons with John Mayer". Each article featured a lesson and his (often humorous) take on various topics, both of personal and popular interest. In the August 2005 issue, he invited readers to create music for orphaned lyrics he had written.<ref name=contest>Mayer, John (September 2005), [http://www.esquire.com/features/music/ESQ0106MUSIC_38 "The Giveaway: John Mayer's Songwriting Contest"] ''Esquire''.

''Esquire''. '''145''' (1):38</ref>

Mayer has been active online, and has maintained four blogs: a MySpace page, a blog at his official site, another at Honeyee.com, as well as a [[photoblog]] at StunningNikon.com. Although they primarily deal with career-related matters, they also contain jokes, comedic videos, his convictions, and his personal activities; they occasionally overlap in content. He is noted for writing the blogs himself, and not through a publicist.<ref name=time100/><ref name=MandS/> His official blog's entry for [[2008-01-23]] contained a graphic that read, "Done & Dusted & Self Conscious & Back to Work." followed by the quote "There is danger in theoretical speculation of battle, in prejudice, in
false reasoning, in pride, in [[wiktionary:braggadocio|braggadocio]]. There is one safe resource,

In the mid-2000s, stand-up comedy was a hobby of Mayer's. He would make random appearances at the famed [[Comedy Cellar]] in New York. While he said that it helped him write better,<ref name=RS06/> he said that media attention has made him have to be too careful about what he says; he also felt that he wasn't funny.<ref>"[[June 8]], [[2008]]".

Mayer has a number of tattoos.

{{cnote|a|Generally, it was believed that Mayer's father, a [[Bridgeport High School]] principal, had given him a tape player (confiscated from a student) that happened to contain [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] album. However, in a 2006 interview on the New Zealand show ''[[Close Up]]'' (and other interviews), Mayer said that this wasn't true.<ref name=CU/>}}
