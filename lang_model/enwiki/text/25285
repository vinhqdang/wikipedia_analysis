'''Minneapolis''' ([[IPA chart for English|pronounced]]: {{IPA|/<U+02CC>m<U+026A>ni<U+02C8><U+00E6>p<U+0259>l<U+026A>s/}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Minneapolis |title=Minneapolis<U+2014>Definitions| work=Dictionary.com | publisher=Lexico Publishing Group, LLC |accessdate=2007-06-23}}</ref>) is the largest [[city]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Minnesota]] and is the [[county seat]] of [[Hennepin County, Minnesota|Hennepin County]]. The city lies on both banks of the [[Mississippi River]], just north of the river's confluence with the [[Minnesota River]], and adjoins [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], the state's [[capital]]. Known as the ''Twin Cities'', these two cities form the core of [[Minneapolis-St. Paul]], the 16th-largest [[metropolitan area]] in the [[United States]], with about 3.2 million residents. The city of Minneapolis' population is estimated at 372,811 people as of 2005.

Once a hub for [[timber]] and [[flour]] [[milling]], Minneapolis is the primary business center in the vast expanse between [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]] and [[Seattle, Washington]].<ref name=Emporis /> The community has a long tradition of charitable support through progressive public social programs and through private and corporate [[philanthropy]].

Public [[park system]]s are modeled after Minneapolis, where lakes are used for recreation year-around, and a park is within one-half mile (.8&nbsp;km) of every home. [[regional theatre in the United States|Regional theater]] was pioneered at the city's [[Guthrie Theater]] and is part of a strong local tradition in the performing arts.

The name ''Minneapolis'' is attributed to the city's first schoolmaster, who combined [[Minnehaha]] and ''mni'', the [[Dakota language|Dakota]] word for [[water]], and ''polis'', the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for city.<ref>{{cite web| title= Dakota Dictionary Online| publisher= University of Minnesota Department of American Indian Studies (fmdb.cla.umn.edu)| url= http://fmdb.cla.umn.edu/dakota/}} and {{cite web | title= A History of Minneapolis: Naming of Minneapolis |publisher= Minneapolis Public Library (mpls.lib.mn.us)| url= http://www.mpls.lib.mn.us/history/eh4.asp| accessdate= 2007-03-18}}</ref> Minneapolis is nicknamed the ''City of Lakes'' and the ''Mill City''.<ref name=Emporis>{{cite web|title= Minneapolis|publisher=Emporis Buildings (emporis.com)| url= http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/?id=101331| accessdate= 2007-03-18}}</ref>

Dakota [[Sioux]] were the region's sole residents until [[explorer]]s arrived from France in about 1680. Nearby [[Fort Snelling, Minnesota|Fort Snelling]], built in 1819 by the [[United States Army]] spurred growth in the area. Circumstances pressed the [[Mdewakanton]] band of the Dakota to sell their land, allowing people arriving from the east to settle there. Present day Minneapolis was incorporated as a town on the Mississippi's west bank in 1856, incorporated as a city in 1867, the year rail service began between Minneapolis and Chicago, and joined with the east bank city of St. Anthony in 1872.<ref>{{cite web | publisher= Minneapolis Public Library (mpls.lib.mn.us) | date=2001 | title=A History of Minneapolis: Mdewakanton Band of the Dakota Nation, Parts I and II | url=http://www.mpls.lib.mn.us/history/eh1.asp}} and {{cite web | title=A History of Minneapolis: Minneapolis Becomes Part of the United States| url=http://www.mpls.lib.mn.us/history/eh3.asp}}, and {{cite web | title=A History of Minneapolis: Governance and Infrastructure | url= http://www.mpls.lib.mn.us/history/cg1.asp}} and {{cite web | title=A History of Minneapolis: Railways | url= http://www.mpls.lib.mn.us/history/tr2.asp | accessdate=2007-04-30}}.</ref>

Minneapolis history and the city's economic growth are tied to water, the city's defining physical characteristic, which was sent to the region during the [[Wisconsin glaciation|last ice age]].

The climate of Minneapolis is typical of the [[Upper Midwest|Upper Midwestern United States]]. [[Winter]]s are bitterly cold and dry, while summer is warm, sometimes hot, and frequently humid. On the [[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]], Minneapolis falls in the warm summer [[humid continental climate]] zone (''Dfa''). The city experiences a full range of precipitation and related weather events, including [[snow]], [[sleet]], [[ice]], [[rain]], [[thunderstorm]]s, [[tornado]]es, and [[fog]]. The warmest temperature ever recorded in Minneapolis was 108&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (42.2&nbsp;<U+00B0>C) in July 1936, and the coldest temperature ever recorded was -41&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (-40.6&nbsp;<U+00B0>C), in January 1888. The snowiest winter of record was 1983&ndash;84, when 98.4&nbsp;in (2.5&nbsp;m) of snow fell.<ref>{{cite web| author= Fisk, Charles| url= http://home.att.net/~minn_climo/| title= Links to Some of the More Interesting Years With Accompanying Notes| date= [[March 3]] [[2007]]| accessdate= 2007-03-25}}</ref>

Because of its northerly location in the United States and lack of large bodies of water to moderate the air, Minneapolis is frequently subjected to cold arctic [[air mass]]es throughout the winter months.

Minneapolitans are a diverse group of people with ancestors from five continents. Their heritage of welcoming newcomers began in the 19th and continues into the 21st century. During the 1850s and 1860s, new settlers arrived from [[New England]] and [[New York]], and during the mid-1860s, Scandinavians from [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], and [[Denmark]] began to call the city home. Later, immigrants came from [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]], [[Poland]], and southern and eastern Europe.

Early Minneapolis experienced a period of corruption in local government and crime was common until an economic downturn in the mid 1900s. Since 1950 the population decreased and much of downtown was lost to urban renewal and highway construction.
