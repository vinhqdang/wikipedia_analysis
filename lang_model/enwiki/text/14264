The '''effects of Hurricane Isabel in Delaware''' resulted in one of only twelve presidential disaster declarations for the state of [[Delaware]]. [[Hurricane Isabel]] formed from a [[tropical wave]] on [[September 6]] [[2003]] in the tropical [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165&nbsp;mph (265&nbsp;km/h) on [[September 11]]. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] with winds of 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h) on [[September 18]]. It quickly weakened over land and became [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] over [[Pennsylvania]] the next day. The storm's center remained to the south and west of Delaware, and was about 175 miles (280 km) from Delaware at its closest approach. At that time, Isabel was a strong tropical storm located in central [[Virginia]].<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Jack Beven & Hugh Cobb|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=2006-11-15|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003isabel.shtml?}}</ref>

The effects of the hurricane were compounded by flooding caused by the remnants of [[Tropical Storm Henri (2003)|Tropical Storm Henri]] days before. Moderate winds of up to 62&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) downed numerous trees, tree limbs, and power lines across the state, leaving at least 15,300 without power. Numerous low-lying areas were flooded due to high surf, strong storm surge, or run-off from flooding further inland. The passage of Hurricane Isabel resulted in $40&nbsp;million in damage (2003&nbsp;USD, $44&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD) and no casualties in the state.

On [[September 16]], 44&nbsp;hours before Hurricane Isabel made landfall on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]], the [[National Hurricane Center]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm watch]] for the entire coastline of [[Delaware]]. The National Hurricane Center also briefly issued a hurricane watch for the coastline. On [[September 17]], 26&nbsp;hours before Isabel made landfall, the watches were changed to tropical storm warnings.<ref name="tcr"/> While over the western [[Atlantic Ocean]] as a [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category 5 hurricane]], forecasters predicted Isabel would move northwestward and within five days be at a position 155&nbsp;miles (250&nbsp;km) south-southeast of [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes]] as a 115&nbsp;mph (185 km/h) major hurricane.<ref name="lawrence32">{{cite web|author=Lawrence|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Discussion Thirty-Two|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-11-15|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/dis/al132003.discus.032.shtml?}}</ref> Though located within the [[1-2-3 rule|cone of uncertainty]], all subsequent forecasts predicted a landfall on North Carolina with the hurricane passing to the west of the state.<ref name="isabelarchive">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Advisory Archive|accessdate=2006-12-24|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/ISABEL.shtml?}}</ref>

==Impact==

Strong swells from the hurricane produced a moderate [[storm surge]] which peaked at 8.66&nbsp;feet (2.64&nbsp;m) in [[Reedy Point, Delaware|Reedy Point]].<ref name="tcr"/> Tides were only slightly above normal, though high surf on top of the storm surge resulted in beach erosion,<ref name="ncdc">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=2003|title=Event Report for Delaware|accessdate=2006-12-24|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~494483}}</ref> particularly in [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]].<ref name="phil"/> Waves of 17&nbsp;feet (5.18&nbsp;m) in height were reported near the coastline.<ref name="isabel1"/> The high waters breached dunes south of [[Bethany Beach, Delaware|Bethany Beach]], and several locations along [[Delaware Route 1]] were flooded.<ref name="ncdc"/> The large circulation of Isabel produced gusty winds across the state, including a maximum of 70&nbsp;mph (113&nbsp;km/h) in [[Delaware Pilot Tower]] in the [[Delaware Bay]]. Onshore, gusts peaked at 62&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) in [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes]],<ref name="phil">{{cite web|author=Gorse & Frugis|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Post Tropical Storm Report|publisher=Mount Holly, New Jersey National Weather Service|accessdate=2006-12-24|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/phi/storms/09192003.txt|format=TXT}}</ref> where sustained winds of 53&nbsp;mph were also reported.<ref name="tcr"/> Precipitation was heavy but sporadic, amounting to a maximum of 1.88&nbsp;inches (48&nbsp;mm) in [[Greenwood, Delaware|Greenwood]].<ref name="ncdc"/> Heavy rainfall further inland resulted in moderate to severe river flooding. The [[Christina River]] at [[Cooch's Bridge]] crested at 2.38&nbsp;feet (0.725&nbsp;m) above flood stage, and the [[Red Clay Creek]] at [[Wooddale, Delaware|Wooddale]] crested at roughly 4&nbsp;inches (100&nbsp;mm) above flood stage. [[Runoff]] from streams were slowed due to the approaching storm surge from the hurricane.<ref name="ncdc"/>

At the [[Delaware Breakwater East End Light|Delaware Breakwater East End Lighthouse]] in [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes]], strong waves destroyed the lower deck of the lighthouse, while powerful winds blew out the watchroom window.

==Aftermath==
On [[September 20]], two days after Hurricane Isabel passed the state, Governor [[Ruth Ann Minner]] made a formal request for a federal disaster declaration for the state.<ref name="wrap"/> Later that day, [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W.

The declaration allowed for the use of federal disaster funds and emergency resources to help families and businesses recover from the effects of Hurricane Isabel.<ref name="delar">{{cite web|author=Federal Emergency Management Agency|year=2006|title=Delaware State Disaster History|accessdate=2006-12-26|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/disasters_state.fema?id=10}}</ref> State and federal officials opened a disaster recovery center in [[Georgetown, Delaware|Georgetown]] and [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]] to assist individuals who suffered losses from Isabel and the remnants of [[Tropical Storm Henri (2003)|Tropical Storm Henri]] just days before.<ref name="drc">{{cite web|author=FEMA|year=2003|title=Disaster Recovery Centers to Open|accessdate=2006-12-26|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=5178}}</ref> 761&nbsp;people visited the recovery centers before they closed.<ref name="final">{{cite web|author=FEMA|year=2003|title=Disaster Victims Receive Over $3.5 Million In Assistance So Far|accessdate=2006-12-26|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=7748}}</ref> One week after the disaster declaration, residents began receiving checks for those who applied for aid.<ref name="check">{{cite web|author=FEMA|year=2003|title=Storm Disaster Victims Receiving Checks|accessdate=2006-12-26|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=5275}}</ref> By about two months after the passage of Hurricane Isabel, 659 residents applied for assistance, with slightly over $1&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $1.1 million 2006 USD) being distributed to the victims. 141 loan applications were received, as well. FEMA distributed about $2.5&nbsp;million ($2.7&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD) in Small Business Administration loans, and also received 183 public assistance loans for repair or replacement of public facilities.<ref name="final"/>

35 power crews, along with outside contractors, worked to restore power. By two days after the storm, 2,000 remained without power in scattered areas.<ref name="wrap"/> Various locations in the city of [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]] were without power for about 30 hours. There, the removal of debris exceded the capacity of the local landfall, resulting in officials temporarily storing it elsewhere.<ref name="dover"/> Over 200&nbsp;volunteers donated time, food and money to provide hot meals for individuals and families affected by the storm. Support teams provided by county officials transported over 300 tons of ruined accessories from the storm, such as appliances, carpets, and drywall, to local landfills.<ref name="cmbt">{{cite web|author=FEMA|year=2003|title=Community Momentum Builds to Help Storm Victims|accessdate=2006-12-26|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=7554}}</ref> Qualifying for two [[NASCAR]] races in [[Dover International Speedway|Dover]] were cancelled due to the passage of the hurricane, although the races went on as scheduled.<ref name="nascar">{{Cite web|author=Northeastern Supply|year=2003|title=Race Update for Jason Keller|accessdate=2006-12-31|url=http://www.northeastern.com/live/racing/2003/jkDover2.asp}}</ref>
