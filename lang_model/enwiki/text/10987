The '''sand whiting''', ''Sillago ciliata'', (also known as the '''summer whiting''', '''yellowfin whiting''' or '''blue-nose whiting''') is a common species of [[coastal fish|coastal marine fish]] of the family [[Sillaginidae]], the smelt-whitings. It is a slender, slightly compressed fish that is very similar to other species of ''Sillago'', with detailed [[Fish_anatomy#Spines_and_rays|spine]], [[Fish_anatomy#Spines_and_rays|ray]] and [[lateral line]] [[scale (zoology)|scale]] counts needed to distinguish the species between its nearest relative ''[[Sillago analis]]''. The sand whiting is distributed along the east coast of Australia from [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]] south to [[Tasmania]], as well as [[Lord Howe Island]] and [[New Caledonia]] in the Pacific Ocean.

The sand whiting commonly inhabits shallow [[sand]]y substrates in [[bay]]s, [[estuaries]] and surf zones where it preys on [[polychaete]] worms, small [[crustacean]]s and [[bivalve]] [[mollusc]]s. [[Reproduction]] in the species is variable over its range, generally [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] twice between September and April. Young fish inhabit shallow [[tidal flat|sand flat]]s, both along the coast and well into the upper reaches of estuaries.

First described in 1829, the species has long been prized as a table fish and is commonly sought by both [[angling|recreational]] and [[commercial fishing|commercial fishermen]] in [[New South Wales]] and [[Queensland]]. The sand whiting [[fishery]] is most prolific in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales where the species is most abundant, often caught along other species of whiting in estuaries and from beaches. Due to its importance as a commercial fish, substantial research has been carried out on the species, especially [[feasibility study|feasibility studies]] involving the use of sand whiting in [[aquaculture]].

==Taxonomy and naming==
The sand whiting belongs to the [[genus]] ''[[Sillago]]'', a division of the smelt whiting family [[Sillaginidae]] containing 29 individual [[species]]. The Sillaginidae are in the [[suborder]] [[Percoidei]], a division of the [[Perciformes]].<ref name = "Fishbase">{{FishBase species | genus = Sillago | species = ciliata | year = 2007 | month = Aug }}</ref>

The species was first identified and named by the French [[naturalist]] [[Georges Cuvier]] in 1829 after receiving a [[Biological specimen|specimen]] that was listed as having been collected in the "Southern seas". This [[holotype]] specimen was apparently taken near the coastline of [[Tasmania]], Australia.<ref name = "McKay1985">{{Citation | last = McKay | first = R.J. | title = A revision of the fishes of the family Sillaginidae | journal = Memoirs of the Queensland Museum | volume = 23 | pages = 1<U+2013>73 | year = 1985 }}</ref> Four [[junior synonym]]s were subsequently placed on the species, with [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Louis de la Porte, comte de Castelnau|Castelnau]] applying both ''S. insularis'' and ''S. terra-reginae'', Thiolli<U+00E8>re applying ''S. diadoi'' and [[Gilbert Percy Whitley|Whitley]] ''S. ciliata diadoi'' to the species. All of these names are invalid under the ICZN [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|nomenclature rules]], which states that the first correct naming is the one to be used. Many of these synonyms were applied due to confusion over ''S. ciliata'' and the nearly identical, closely related species ''[[Sillago analis|S. analis]]''. The species was also misidentified as ''S. gracilis'', a synonym of ''[[Sillago maculata|S. maculata]]'', the trumpeter whiting; and also ''[[Sillago bassensis|S. bassensis]]'', the southern school whiting.<ref name = "McKay1985" />

''S. ciliata'' is most commonly called the 'sand whiting' in reference to its preference for [[sand]]y [[substrate (marine biology)|substrates]] compared to some members of the [[Sillago|genus]] which prefer [[mud]]dy, [[silt]]y, or [[seagrass|grassy]] substrates.<ref name = "McKayFAO" >{{Citation | last = McKay | first = R.J. | coauthors = | title = FAO Species Catalogue: Vol. 14.

This name is applied to these species as they move from deeper offshore waters into shallow [[beach]] and [[estuary|estuarine]] waters in summer, where they become a target for [[angling|recreational fishers]].

==Description==
[[File:Sand whiting trio.jpg|thumb|240 px|Three sand whiting]]The sand whiting has a very similar profile to other members of the genus ''[[Sillago]]'', with a slightly compressed, elongate body tapering toward the terminal mouth. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first made of feeble spines and the second of soft rays headed by a single feeble spine, while the ventral profile is straight.<ref name = "Kuiter" >{{Citation | last = Kuiter | first = R.H. | coauthors =  | title = Coastal fishes of south-eastern Australia | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | year = 1993 | location = U.S.A | pages = | isbn =1-86333-067-4 }}</ref> The species is known to grow to a maximum size of 51&nbsp;cm and around 1.25&nbsp;kg weight.<ref name = "McKayFAO" /> 

The [[fin]] [[anatomy]] is highly useful for identification purposes, with the species having 11 [[Fish_anatomy#Spines_and_rays|spines]] in the first [[dorsal fin]], with one spine and 16 or 18 [[Fish_anatomy#Spines_and_rays|soft ray]]s on the second dorsal fin. The [[anal fin]] has two spines with 15 to 17 soft rays [[Anatomical_terms_of_location#Anterior_and_posterior|posterior]] to the spines. [[Lateral line]] [[scale (zoology)|scale]]s and [[cheek]] scales are also distinctive, with sand whiting possessing 60 to 69 lateral line scales and cheek scales positioned in 3-4 rows, all of which are [[ctenoid]]. The amount of [[vertebrae]] are also diagnostic, having 32 to 34 in total. The [[swim bladder]] has rudimentary tubules
projecting [[Anatomical_terms_of_location#Anterior_and_posterior|anteriorly]] and a series laterally that diminish in size and become sawtooth-like posteriorly. The posterior  extension is a single, tapering projection that extends well into the caudal region. A duct like process extends from the ventral surface to the urogenital opening. Swim bladder morphology is useless when determining between ''S. ciliata'' and ''S. analis'', as they are nearly identical.<ref name = "McKay1985" />

The body is a pale brown or [[silver (colour)|silver]]y brown colour, transitioning to white below, with green, [[mauve]] and [[Rosy (color)|rosy]] reflections when the fish is first removed from the water. An indistinct silver-yellow mid-lateral band extends across some specimens. The spinous [[dorsal fin]] is olive green with faint darker blotches, the second dorsal fin also a pale olive with rows of dark brown to blackish spots. The anal and ventral fins are pale yellow, the [[pectoral fin|pectorals]] are pale yellow to pale brown with a well defined dark blue-black blotch at the base. The caudal fin is yellow to olive in colour with darker margins. [[Juvenile (organism)|Juveniles]] less than 90&nbsp;mm may have darker blotches along their sides and backs.<ref name = "McKay1985" />

==Distribution and habitat==
The sand whiting inhabits a range along the east coast of Australia from [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]], [[Queensland]], southward along the coast and the [[Great Barrier Reef]] to eastern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and the east coast of [[Tasmania]] down to [[Southport]]. The species also inhabits a number of islands; [[Lord Howe Island]], [[New Caledonia]], and [[Woodlark Island]], [[Papua New Guinea]]. The species is most abundant in lower Queensland and New South Wales, where studies show it inhabits every estuary sampled throughout the course of a study,<ref name = "gray96">{{Citation | last =  Gray | first = C.A. | last2 = McElligott | first2 = D.J. | last3 = Chick | first3 = R.C. | title = Intra- and Inter-estuary Differences in Assemblages of Fishes Associated with Shallow Seagrass and Bare Sand | journal = Marine and Freshwater Research | volume = 47 | issue =  5 | pages = 723<U+2013>735 | url = http://www.publish.csiro.au/?paper=MF9960723 | year = 1996 | id = | doi =  10.1071/MF9960723  }}</ref> while in north Queensland, the species is very patchily distributed along the coast.<ref name = "sheaveso6">{{Citation | last =  Sheaves | first = M. | title = Scale-dependent variation in composition of fish fauna among sandy tropical estuarine embayments | journal = Marine Ecology Progress Series | volume = 310 | pages = 173<U+2013>184 | url = http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v310/p173-184/ | year = 2006 | id = | doi =  10.3354/meps310173  }}</ref>

The sand whiting is an [[inshore]] species, inhabiting exposed coastal areas such as [[beach]]es, [[sandbar]]s and [[surf zone]]s as well as quieter [[bay]]s, [[estuaries]] and coastal lakes. Sand whiting enter estuaries, including intermittently open ones, and penetrate far upstream to the tidal limits of rivers and [[Stream|creeks]] where juveniles and adolescent fish may be abundant.<ref name = "griffiths99">{{Citation | doi =  10.1111/j.1365-2400.1999.tb00082.x | last =  Griffiths | first = R.J. | last2 = West | first2 =  R.

Studies on the species over the period of a year have shown the species does not change its local distribution over the course of a day, generally being of the same abundance during both night and day.<ref name = "somethong" /> Seasonal abundance due to spawning is variable, with studies conducted in [[Moreton Bay, Queensland]] finding the species recruits heavily to shallow waters and increase numbers during winter months, while studies in the [[Noosa, Queensland|Noosa River]] estuary have shown no difference in numbers recruited over the course of a season.<ref name = "somethiing">{{Citation | last =  Weng | first = H.T. | title = Identification, habitats and seasonal occurrence of juvenile whiting (Sillaginidae) in Moreton Bay, Queensland | journal = Journal of Fish Biology | volume = 23 | issue =  2 | pages = 195<U+2013>200 | url = http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1983.tb02894.x | year = 1983 | id = | doi =  10.1111/j.1095-8649.1983.tb02894.x  }}</ref> Like other sillaginids, they have the ability to 'burrow' into the sand and remained hidden until a [[predator]] or [[seine net]] has passed by.<ref name = "McKayFAO" />

===Diet===
The sand whiting's distinctive body shape and mouth placement is an adaptation to [[benthic|bottom feeding]], which is the predominant method of feeding for all whiting species. All larger whiting feed by using their protrusile [[jaw]]s and tube-like mouths to suck up various types of prey from in, on or above the ocean [[substrate (marine biology)|substrate]],<ref name = "Hyndes1997">{{Citation | last = Hyndes | first = G.A. | last2 = Platell | first2 = M.E. | last3 = Potter | first3 = I.C. | title = Relationships between diet and body size, mouth morphology, habitat and movements of six Sillaginid species in coastal waters: implications for resource partitioning | journal = Marine Biology | volume = 128 | issue = 4 | pages = 585<U+2013>598 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/0tvu441v8xx2tqqd/ | year = 1997 | id = | doi = 10.1007/s002270050125  }}</ref> as well as using their nose as a '[[plough]]' to dig through the substrate.<ref name = "McKayFAO" />

==Relationship to humans==
The sand whiting is a highly prized [[Fish (food)|table fish]] often rated equal to the [[King George whiting]],<ref name = "Hutchins" /> making it a common target for both commercial and recreational [[fisheries]]. The [[flesh]] is white, tender and has a moist, low [[oil]] content composition, making it easily digestible.<ref name = "book2" /> Investigations into the [[aquaculture]] of the species began in the 1980s, and has led to the development of farmed sand whiting.

===Commercial fishery===
Although the sand whiting ranges down to Victoria and Tasmania, the species is not common enough to make up a significant part of their fisheries, with other sillaginids such as school whiting and stout whiting making up the bulk of the catch. In New South Wales and Queensland, however, it is one of the most common species taken, especially in lower Queensland. The species is often not differentiated from  golden-lined whiting or trumpeter whiting, meaning fisheries [[statistics]] do not reflect the total catch for the species. In 2000, 238 [[tonne]]s of whiting were taken in Queensland, a decrease from the past 4 years.<ref name = "Qld" >{{Citation | last = Williams | first = L.E. | coauthors = | title = Queensland's Fisheries Resources: Current conditions and recent trends 1988-2000 | publisher = Department of Primary Industries Queensland | year = 2002 | location = Brisbane | pages = 174<U+2013>178 | url = http://www2.dpi.qld.gov.au/fishweb/9014.html | isbn = }}</ref> The species is primarily taken in estuaries in New South Wales, and is also included under the general heading of 'school whiting' when taken from beaches.<ref name = "NSW" >{{Citation | last = Wilkinson | first = J. | coauthors = | title = NSW Fishing Industry: Changes and Challenges in the Twenty-First Century | publisher = NSW Parliamentary Library Research Service | year = 2004 | location = Sydney | pages = 174<U+2013>178 | url = http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/publications.nsf/0/07532F82AC6487FFCA256F16001BBE85 | isbn =  0-7313-1768-8}}</ref> Research showed that the average commercial [[harvest]] from individual estuaries was around 1-2 tonnes per year, with an increase in most rivers during the 1970s and 80's.<ref name = "est">{{Citation | last =  West | first = R.J. | last2 = Gordon | first2 = G.N.G. | title = Commercial and Recreational Harvest of Fish from two Australian Coastal Rivers | journal = Aust.

The species is commonly taken by a number of fishing methods, with the most common being [[seine net]]s. Ring, fence, fyke netting and beam [[trawling]] are also used occasionally, but more often associated with sampling the entire population for [[research]] purposes.<ref name = "sample">{{Citation | last =  Butcher | first = A. | last2 = Mayer | first2 = D. | last3 = Smallwood | first3 = D. | last4 = Johnston | first4 = M. | title = A comparison of the relative efficiency of ring, fyke, fence nets and beam trawling for estimating key estuarine fishery populations | journal =  Fisheries Research | volume = 32 | pages = 51<U+2013>60 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T6N-4FJGW29-2&_user=10&_coverDate=07%2F31%2F2005&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=a326e117cb4e9e61a8b8bc9ff9484c99 | year = 1997 | id = | doi=10.1016/j.fishres.2005.01.014}}</ref>  Research has focused on the effectiveness of different [[mesh]] sizes used to net the species in order to prevent juvenile individuals dying after becoming enmeshed.<ref name = "Kennelly">{{Citation | last =  Kennelly | first = S.J. | last2 = Gray, | first2 = S.A. | title = Reducing the mortality of discarded undersize sand whiting Sillago ciliata in an estuarine seine fishery | journal =  Marine and Freshwater Research | volume = 51 | issue =  8 | pages = 749<U+2013>53 | url = http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/MF00014.htm | year = 2000 | id = | doi =  10.1071/MF00014  }}</ref> Associated research has also shown that those whiting that survive and are discarded tend to have much lower survival rates due to [[scale (zoology)|scale]] loss, which is a major issue, as many young fish are regularly taken in such nets and released by the [[fisherman]] after sustaining scale loss.<ref name = "sample2">{{Citation | last =  Gray | first = C.A. | last2 = Kennelly | first2 = S.J. | last3 = Hodgson | first3 = K.E. | last4 = Ashby | first4 = C.J.T. | title = Retained and discarded catches from commercial beach-seining in Botany Bay, Australia | journal =  Fisheries Research | volume = 50 | issue =  3 | pages = 205<U+2013>219 | url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/01657836/2001/00000050/00000003/art00228 | year = 2001 | id = | doi =  10.1016/S0165-7836(00)00228-9  }}</ref> These studies have led to a number of proposals and subsequent changes to net [[regulations]].<ref name = "Broadhurst00">{{Citation | last =  Broadhurst | first = M.K. | last2 = Kennelly, | first2 = S.J. | last3 = Barker | first3 = D.T. | title = Simulated escape of juvenile sand whiting ( Sillago ciliata, Cuvier) through square-meshes: Effects on scale-loss and survival | journal =  Fisheries Research | volume = 32 | pages = 51<U+2013>60 | url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/01657836/1997/00000032/00000001/art00037 | year = 1997 | id = | doi =  10.1016/S0165-7836(97)00037-4  }}</ref>

At [[market]], sand whiting is medium priced fish, sold fresh or frozen; whole and in [[Fillet (cut)|fillet]] form. In abundance, sand whiting is moderately priced, with fillets being slightly more expensive. The recovery rate of fillets from whole fish is about 40%.<ref name = "market" >{{Citation | last = Sydney Fish Market | first =  | title = Sand Whiting | url = http://sydneyfishmarket.com.au/%5Csfm/uploadedFiles/docs/WHITING_SAND.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2007-08-17  |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061008073056/http://www.sydneyfishmarket.com.au/sfm/uploadedFiles/docs/WHITING_SAND.pdf |archivedate = October 8, 2006}}</ref> Sand whiting may be used as [[sashimi]].

===Recreational fishery===

{{see also|Smelt-whiting fishing}}
Sand whiting are commonly sought after by [[anglers]] due to their reputation as a food fish, and due to their relative accessibility, with large catches possible from many [[shore]]-based locations. The catches of recreational fishermen may exceed the catches of professionals, with studies showing Queensland had over twice the amount of fish taken by anglers in 2000.<ref name = "Qld" /> 

The species is commonly caught throughout its habitat, with sand flats, tidal gutters in estuaries and [[surf beach]]es commonly having producing good catches. Excessively shallow water, especially in proximity to [[Zostera]] beds may produce numerous undersized fish, and may be avoided if the young fish are too prevalent. Due to their preferred habitat, light [[fishing line|lines]] with minimal weight added are employed to avoid spooking the fish, with a small running bean or ball [[Sinker (fishing)|sinker]] commonly rigged above a size 4 or 6 [[Fish hook|hook]].<ref name = "starlo" >{{Citation | last = Starling | first = S. | title = The Australian Fishing Book | publisher = Bacragas Pty. Ltd. | year = 1988 | location = Hong Kong | pages = 490 | isbn = 0-7301-0141-X }}</ref> Specialist whiting fishermen often use a red piece of tubing or beads to attract the whiting; whether this works has yet to be proved, but [[anecdotal evidence]] shows the fishermen's catches don't suffer. Baits used resemble the species natural prey, with [[prawn]]s, [[nipper]]s, a variety of [[bivalve]]s and [[polychaete|beach worms]] most often used, with more successful catches obtained using [[Bait (luring substance)|live bait]].<ref name = "favfish" >{{Citation | last = Horrobin | first = P. | title = Guide to Favourite Australian Fish | publisher = Universal Magazines | year = 1997 | location = Singapore | pages = 102<U+2013>103 | isbn = }}</ref>

In New South Wales, sand whiting have a minimum legal length of 27&nbsp;cm to be taken and a daily personal bag limit of 20 applies,<ref name = "legalNSW" >{{Citation | last = New South Wales Department of Primary Industries | first =  | title = Bag and Size Limits - Saltwater | url = http://www2.dpi.qld.gov.au/extra/pdf/fishweb/InshoreBGBagsize.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2007-08-17  }}</ref>  while in Queensland there is a minimum size of 23&nbsp;cm and a combined bag limit of 30 for all whiting species.<ref name = "legalqld" >{{Citation | last = Queensland Government Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries | first =  | title = Recreational fishing size and bag limits for tidal waters in Queensland - July 2010 | url = http://www.dpi.qld.gov.au/documents/Fisheries_RecreationalFishing/Size-and_take-tidal.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2010-09-16  }}</ref>

Sand whiting are used themselves as live bait for larger species such as mulloway, [[mangrove jack]] and large [[platycephalidae|flathead]], although anglers must still adhere to the minimum size limit.<ref name = "livebait" >{{Citation | last = Downie | first = David | title = Live-baiting Brisbane Estuaries | url = http://www.fishing-boating.com/articles/nuggetlivebaiting.htm | accessdate = 2007-08-17  }}</ref>

===Aquaculture===
The [[aquaculture]] potential for sand whiting was first investigated in the late 1980s, with a number of reports detailing both successful trials and also a number of problems with such trials. A 1988 study showed that sand whiting were more likely to grow in captivity than other whiting species, but the [[mortality rate]] of over 50% was unacceptable for use in an economic setting.
