The '''lion''' (''Panthera leo'') is a member of the family [[Felidae]] and one of four [[big cat]]s in the [[genus]] ''[[Panthera]]''. With exceptionally large males exceeding 250 kg (550&nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]]) in weight,<ref name="nowak">{{cite book |last=Nowak |first= Ronald M. |year=1999 |title=Walker's Mammals of the World |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-5789-9}}</ref> it is the second-largest living cat after the [[tiger]]. Wild lions currently exist in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and in [[Asia]] with a [[critically endangered]] remnant population in northwest [[India]], having disappeared from [[North Africa]], the Middle East, and western Asia in historic times. Until the late [[Pleistocene]] (about 10,000 years ago), the lion was the most widespread large land mammal beside humans. They were found in most of Africa, much of Eurasia from western Europe to India, and the [[Bering land bridge]] and, in the Americas, from the [[Yukon]] to Peru.

Lions live for approximately 10&ndash;14&nbsp;years in the wild, while in captivity they can live over 20&nbsp;years. They typically inhabit [[savanna]] and [[grassland]], although they may take to bush and [[forest]]. Lions are unusually [[social animal|social]] compared to other cats. A pride of lions consists of related females and offspring and a small number of adult males. Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large [[ungulate]]s. The lion is an [[apex predator|apex]] and [[keystone predator]], although they will resort to scavenging if the opportunity arises. While lions, in general, do not selectively hunt humans, some have been known to become man-eaters and seek human prey.

The lion is a [[vulnerable species]], having seen a possibly irreversible population decline of 30 to 50% over the past two decades in its African range;<ref name=IUCN/> populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not well-understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are currently the greatest causes of concern. Lions have been kept in [[menagerie]]s since [[Roman era|Roman times]] and have been a key species sought after and exhibited in [[zoo]]s the world over since the late eighteenth century. Zoos are cooperating worldwide in breeding programs for the endangered [[Asiatic Lion|Asiatic subspecies]].

The male lion is highly distinctive and is easily recognized by its [[mane]]. The head of the male lion, is one of the most widely recognized animal symbols in human [[culture]]. It has been depicted extensively in literature, in [[sculpture]]s, in [[painting]]s, on national [[flag]]s, and in contemporary [[film]]s and [[literature]].

The lioness has been recognized, however, as the pinnacle of hunting prowess from the earliest of human writings and graphic representations. The lionesses are the hunters for their pride and execute their skills with precision and complex teamwork. Each lioness develops specific skills for her role in the hunting techniques used by her pride and, generally, assumes that role during most hunts. Members of human cultures living among lions in natural habitats have understood this characteristic and often have chosen the lioness to represent their most ferocious [[List of war deities|war deities]] and [[warriors]], often naming their male rulers as her "son". Examples drawn from the earliest of written records include the [[Egyptian pantheon]] deities of [[Sekhmet]], [[Bast]], [[Menhit]], and [[Tefnut]] and these deities may have had precursors in [[Nubia]] and [[Lybia]]. Other Egyptian deities are quite complex and assume aspects that may include one as a lioness headed human or a lioness in specific roles. Depictions of lions hunting in groups have existed from the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period, with carvings and paintings from the [[Lascaux]] and [[Chauvet Cave]]s.

==Naming and etymology==
The lion's name, similar in many Romance languages, derives from the [[Latin]] ''leo'',<ref>{{cite book | author=Simpson DP | title=Cassell's Latin Dictionary | publisher=Cassell Ltd. | date=1979 | edition=5th edition | location=London | pages=p. 883 | isbn=0-304-52257-0}}</ref> and before that the [[Ancient Greek]] ''le<U+014D>n''/<U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03C9><U+03BD>.<ref name="Liddell 1980">{{cite book | author=[[Henry George Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] | year=1980 | title=[[A Greek-English Lexicon]] (Abridged Edition) | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | location=United Kingdom | isbn=0-19-910207-4}}</ref> The [[Hebrew]] word ''lavi'' (<U+05DC><U+05B8><U+05D1><U+05B4><U+05D9><U+05D0>) may also be related,<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia| title=Lion|encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary|editor=Simpson, J., Weiner, E.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
[[Image:Panthera leo Kruger Skull.jpg|thumb|left|Skull of a modern lion at Kruger National Park]]
The oldest lion-like [[fossil]] is known from [[Laetoli]] in [[Tanzania]] and is perhaps 3.5&nbsp;million years old; some scientists have identified the material as ''Panthera leo''. These records are not well-substantiated, and all that can be said is that they pertain to a ''Panthera''-like felid. The oldest confirmed records of ''Panthera leo'' in Africa are about 2&nbsp;million years younger.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Werdelin |first=Lars |coauthors=Lewis, Margaret E. |year=2005 |month=June |title=Plio-Pleistocene Carnivora of eastern Africa: species richness and turnover patterns |journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=144|issue=2 |pages=121<U+2013>144 |publisher=The Linnean Society of London |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/zoj/2005/00000144/00000002/art00001 |accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref>
The closest relatives of the lion are the other ''[[Panthera]]'' species: the [[tiger]], the [[jaguar]] and the [[leopard]]. Morphological and genetic studies reveal that the tiger was the first of these recent species to diverge. About 1.9&nbsp;million years ago the Jaguar branched off the remaining group, which contained ancestors of the leopard and lion. The Lion and leopard subsequently separated about 1 to 1.25&nbsp;million years ago from each other.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Yu |first=Li |coauthors=Ya-ping Zhang |month=May |year=2003 |title=Phylogenetic studies of pantherine cats (Felidae) based on multiple genes, with novel application of nuclear <U+03B2>-fibrinogen intron 7 to carnivores |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=483<U+2013>495 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2005.01.017}}</ref>

''Panthera leo'' itself evolved in Africa between 1 million and 800,000 years ago before spreading throughout the [[Holarctic]] region;<ref>{{cite journal |last= Yamaguchi |first=Nobuyuki| coauthors=Alan Cooper, Lars Werdelin and David W.

===Subspecies===
[[Image:P l Bleyenberghi.jpg|thumb|upright|Southwest African lion (''Panthera leo bleyenberghi'')]]
Traditionally 12 recent subspecies of lion were recognized, the largest of which has been recognised as the [[Barbary lion]].<ref>[http://www.tigerhomes.org/animal/barbary-lion.cfm Barbary Lion - Panthera leo leo - Largest Lion Subspecies] Retrieved on [[19 September]], [[2007]]</ref> The major differences between these subspecies are location, mane appearance, size and distribution. Because these characteristics are very insignificant and show a high individual variability, most of these forms were debatable and probably invalid; additionally, they were often based upon zoo material of unknown origin that may have had "striking, but abnormal" morphological characteristics.<ref name="zoos_encyclopedia">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Grisham |first=Jack |editor=Catherine E. Bell |title=Lion |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the World's Zoos |volume=Volume 2: G<U+2013>P |year=2001 |publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn |location=Chofago |id=ISBN1-57958-174-9 |pages=pp.733<U+2013>739 }}</ref> Today only eight subspecies are usually accepted,<ref name="Conservation-Genetics:Preserving-Genetic-Diversity" /><ref name="BurgerJ-Molecular-phylogeny">{{cite journal |author=Burger, Joachim ''et al.'' |month=March |year=2004 |title=Molecular phylogeny of the extinct cave lion ''Panthera leo spelaea'' |journal=[[Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution]] |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=841<U+2013>849 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2003.07.020| url= http://www.uni-mainz.de/FB/Biologie/Anthropologie/MolA/Download/Burger%202004.pdf| accessdate=2007-09-20 }}</ref> but one of these, the Cape lion formerly described as ''Panthera leo melanochaita'' is probably invalid.<ref name="Conservation-Genetics:Preserving-Genetic-Diversity" />
Even the remaining seven subspecies might be too much; [[mitochondria]]l variation in recent African lions is modest, which suggests that all sub-Saharan lions could be considered a single subspecies, possibly divided in two main clades: one to the west of the [[Great Rift Valley]] and the other to the east. Lions from [[Tsavo]] in Eastern Kenya are much closer genetically to lions in [[Transvaal]] (South Africa), than to those in the [[Aberdare Range]] in Western Kenya.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Barnett |first=Ross |coauthors=Nobuyuki Yamaguchi, Ian Barnes and Alan Cooper |year=2006 |title=The origin, current diversity and future conservation of the modern lion (''Panthera leo'') |journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=273 |issue=1598 |pages=2119<U+2013>2125 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.3555 |url= http://www.adelaide.edu.au/acad/publications/papers/Barnett%20PRS%20lions.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2007-09-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Dubach |first=Jean| coauthors=et ''al'' |year=2005 |month=January |title=Molecular genetic variation across the southern and eastern geographic ranges of the African lion, ''Panthera leo'' |journal=Conservation Genetics |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=15<U+2013>24 |doi=10.1007/s10592-004-7729-6}}</ref>

====Recent====
Eight recent subspecies are recognized today:
* '''''P. l. persica''''', known as the '''[[Asiatic lion|Asiatic-]]''' or '''South Asian, Persian or Indian lion''', was once widespread from [[Turkey]], across the [[Middle East]], to [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and even [[Bangladesh]]. However, large prides and daylight activity made it easier to poach than tigers or leopards; now around 300 exist in and near the [[Gir Forest]] of India.<ref name ="Asiaticweb">{{cite web | author=Wildlife Conservation Trust of India | title=Asiatic Lion - History | work=Asiatic Lion Information Centre | publisher=Wildlife Conservation Trust of India | date=2006 | url=http://www.asiaticlion.org/asiatic-lion-history.htm | accessdate=2007-09-15}}</ref>
* '''''P. l. leo''''', known as the '''[[Barbary lion]]''', is extinct in the wild due to excessive hunting, although captive individuals may still exist. This was the largest of the lion subspecies, at 3<U+2013>3.5m approx., and weighing over 150 kilograms and more. They ranged from Morocco to Egypt. The last wild Barbary lion was killed in Morocco in 1922.<ref name=CAP/>
* '''''P. l. senegalensis''''', known as the '''West African lion''', is found in Western Africa, from Senegal to Nigeria.
* '''''P. l. azandica''''', known as the '''North East Congo lion''', is found in the Northeastern parts of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]].
* '''''P. l. nubica''''', known as the '''East African-''' or '''Massai lion''', is found in East Africa, from [[Ethiopia]] and Kenya to [[Tanzania]] and [[Mozambique]].
* '''''P. l. bleyenberghi''''', known as the '''Southwest African-''' or '''Katanga lion'''. It is found in southwestern Africa, [[Zimbabwe]], [[Angola]], [[Katanga]] ([[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Zaire]]).
* '''''P. l. krugeri''''', known as the '''Southeast African-''' or '''Transvaal lion''', is found in the [[Transvaal]] region of South eastern Africa, including [[Kruger National Park]].
* '''''P. l. melanochaita''''', known as the '''[[Cape lion]]''', became extinct in the wild around 1860. Results of [[mitochondrial DNA]] research do not support the status as a distinct subspecies. It seems probable that the Cape lion was only the southernmost population of the extant southern African lion.<ref name="Conservation-Genetics:Preserving-Genetic-Diversity" />

====Prehistoric====
Several additional subspecies of lion existed in prehistoric times:
<!-- prose form please -->
* '''''P. l. atrox''''', known as the '''[[American lion]]''' or '''American cave lion''', was abundant in the Americas from [[Alaska]] to [[Peru]] in the Pleistocene Epoch until about 10,000 years ago. This form as well as the cave lion are sometimes considered to represent separate species, but recent phylogenetic studies lead to suggest, that they are in fact subspecies of the lion (''Panthera leo'').<ref name="BurgerJ-Molecular-phylogeny" /> One of the largest lion subspecies to have existed, its body length is estimated to have been 1.6&ndash;2.5&nbsp;m (5&ndash;8&nbsp;ft).<ref name="Quaternary extinctions">{{cite book |last=Martin |first=P.S. |title=Quaternary Extinctions |year=1984 |publisher= University of Arizona Press|location= Tucson, Arizona|isbn=0-8165-1100-4 }}</ref>
* '''''P. l. fossilis''''', known as the '''[[Panthera leo fossilis|Early Middle Pleistocene European cave lion]]''', flourished about 500,000 years ago; fossils have been recovered from [[Germany]] and [[Italy]]. <!--(commented out until I can find a ref!!) It was larger than today's African lions, with a maximum head and body length of 2.40&nbsp;m (8&nbsp;ft).{{Fact|date=July 2007}}-->

[[Image:Lascaux-diverticule-f<U+00E9>lins.jpg|thumb|300px||right|[[Cave lion]]s, Chamber of Felines, [[Lascaux]] caves]]
* '''''P. l. spelaea''''', known as the '''[[Cave lion|European cave lion]]''', Eurasian cave lion or Upper Pleistocene European cave lion, occurred in Eurasia 300,000 to 10,000 years ago.<ref name="BurgerJ-Molecular-phylogeny" /> This species is known from [[Paleolithic]] [[cave paintings]] (such as the one displayed to the right), [[ivory]] carvings, and clay busts, <ref name="Packer00">{{cite journal | last=Packer | first=Craig | coauthors=Jean Clottes | title=When Lions Ruled France | journal=Natural History | volume=| issue=| pages=52<U+2013>57 | date=November 2000 | url=http://www.lionresearch.org/current_docs/m_pdf/36.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref> indicating it had protruding ears, tufted tails, perhaps faint tiger-like stripes, and that at least some males had a ''ruff'' or primitive mane around their necks.<ref name ="Koenigswald02"/> With this example being a hunting scene it is likely that it depicts females hunting for the pride using the same strategy as their contemporary relatives and males may not be part of the subject. 

* '''''P. l. vereshchagini''''', known as the '''East Siberian-''' or '''[[Beringian cave lion]]''', was found in [[Yakutia]] ([[Russia]]), [[Alaska]] ([[USA]]), and the [[Yukon Territory]] ([[Canada]]). Analysis of skulls and mandibles of this lion demonstrate that it is distinct&mdash;larger than the European cave lion and smaller than the American cave lion with differing [[skull]] proportions.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Baryshnikov|first=G.F. |coauthors=G.

====Dubious====
* '''''P. l. sinhaleyus''''', known as the '''[[Sri Lanka lion]]''', appears to have become extinct [[circa|around]] 39,000 years ago. It is only known from two teeth found in deposits at [[Kuruwita]]. Based on these teeth, P. Deraniyagala erected this subspecies in 1939.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kelum Manamendra-Arachchi, Rohan Pethiyagoda, Rajith Dissanayake, Madhava Meegaskumbura |year=2005 |month= |title=A second extinct big cat from the late Quaternary of Sri Lanka. |journal=The Raffles Bulletin of Zoology Supplement |volume=12 |pages=423<U+2013>434 |id= |url=http://rmbr.nus.edu.sg/rbz/biblio/s12/s12rbz423-434.pdf|publisher=National University of Singapore |accessdate= 2007-07-31}}</ref>
* '''''P. l. europaea''''', known as the '''[[European lion]]''', was probably identical with ''Panthera leo persica'' or ''Panthera leo spelea''; its status as subspecies is unconfirmed. It became extinct around 100 AD due to persecution and over-exploitation. Inhabited the [[Balkans]], the [[Italian Peninsula]], southern [[France]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. It was a very popular object of hunting among [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]]. 
* '''''P. l. youngi''''' or ''Panthera youngi'' , known as the '''[[North-Eastern Pleistocene China cave lion]]''', flourished 350,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Harington |first=CR |year=1969 |title=Pleistocene remains of the lion-like cat (''Panthera atrox'') from the Yukon Territory and northern Alaska |journal=Canadian Journal Earth Sciences |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=1277<U+2013>88 }}</ref> Its relationship to the extant lion subspecies is obscure, and probably represents a distinct species.
*'''''P. l. maculatus''''', known as the '''[[Marozi]]''' or '''Spotted lion''', is sometimes believed to be a distinct subspecies, but may be an adult lion that has retained its juvenile spotted pattern. If it was a subspecies in its own right, rather than a small number of aberrantly colored individuals, it has been extinct since 1931. A less likely identity is a natural leopard/lion [[Panthera hybrid|hybrid]] commonly known as a [[leopon]].<ref name="shuker">{{cite book | last=Shuker | first=Karl P.N. | authorlink=Karl Shuker | title=Mystery Cats of the World | publisher=Robert Hale | year=1989 | isbn=0-7090-3706-6}}</ref>

===Hybrids===
[[Image:bertramliger.jpg|thumb|left|A [[liger]] is the offspring of a male lion and female [[tiger]].]]
{{further|[[Panthera hybrid]], [[liger]] and [[tigon]]}}
Lions also have been known to [[biological reproduction|breed]] with [[tiger]]s (most often the [[Amur Tiger|Amur]] and [[Bengal Tiger|Bengal]] subspecies) to create hybrids called [[liger]]s and [[tigon]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Guggisberg |first=C.

The [[marozi]] is reputedly a spotted lion or a naturally occurring leopon, while the [[Congolese spotted lion]] is a complex lion/jaguar/leopard hybrid called a [[lijagulep]].

Males have about a 50% chance of having a mane, but if they grow one their manes will be modest: around 50% of a pure lion mane.

====Mane====
[[Image:wiki lion.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Thermal image of a lion, showing the insulating manes]]
The mane of the male lion, unique amongst cats, is one of the most distinctive characteristics of the species. It makes the lion appear larger, providing an excellent intimidation display; this aids the lion during confrontations with other lions and with the species' chief competitor in Africa, the [[spotted hyena]].<ref>

Scientists once believed that the distinct status of some subspecies could be justified by [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], including the size of the mane. Morphology was used to identify subspecies such as the [[Barbary lion]] and [[Cape lion]]. Research has suggested, however, that environmental factors influence the color and size of a lion's mane, such as the [[ambient temperature]].<ref name=West/> The cooler ambient temperature in European and North American [[zoo]]s, for example, can result in a heavy mane.

[[Image:Maneless lion from Tsavo East National Park.png|thumb|left|A maneless male lion, who also has little body hair - from Tsavo East National Park, Kenya]]
Maneless lions have been reported in [[Senegal]] and [[Tsavo East National Park]] in Kenya, and the original male white lion from Timbavati was also maneless. [[castration|Castrated]] lions have minimal manes. The lack of a mane is found in inbred lion populations; inbreeding also results in poor fertility.<ref>{{cite web | last=Trivedi | first =Bijal P. | title=To Boost Gene Pool, Lions Artificially Inseminated | work=National Geographic News | publisher=National Geographic | date=12 June 2002 | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/06/0612_020612_TVlion.html| accessdate= 2007-09-20}}</ref>

====White lions====
[[Image:White Lion.jpg|thumb|right|[[White lion]]s owe their coloring to a recessive gene; they are rare forms of the subspecies ''Panthera leo krugeri'']]
The [[white lion]] is not a distinct subspecies, but a special [[Polymorphism (biology)|morph]] with a genetic condition, [[leucism]],<ref name="zoos_encyclopedia"/> that causes paler colouration akin to that of the [[white tiger]]; the condition is similar to [[melanism]], which causes [[black panther]]s. White animals of the Transvaal lion ''(Panthera leo krugeri)'' have been occasionally encountered in and around the [[Kruger National Park]] and the adjacent [[Timbavati Private Game Reserve]] in eastern South Africa, but are more commonly found in [[captive animal|captivity]], where breeders deliberately select them. The unusual cream color of their coats is due to a [[recessive gene]].<ref>{{cite book |last=McBride |first=Chris |title=The White Lions of Timbavati |year=1977 |publisher=E. Stanton |location=Johannesburg |isbn= 0-949997-32-3 }}</ref> They have been reportedly bred in camps in South Africa for use as trophies for [[Canned hunt|canned hunts]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Tucker|first=Linda |title=Mystery of the White Lions - Children of the Sun God|year=2003 |publisher=Npenvu Press|location=Mapumulanga |isbn= 0-620-31409-5}}</ref>

Confirmation of the actual existence of the White lion only came in the late twentieth century. For hundreds of years prior, the White lion had been a figment of legend circulating through South Africa, the white [[pelage]] of the animal said to represent the goodness in all creatures. Claimed sightings were first reported in the early 1900s, and continued, infrequently, for almost 50 years until, in 1975, a litter of white lion cubs were found at Timbavati Game Reserve.<ref name="whitelion">[http://www.lairweb.org.nz/tiger/lions.html The rare white lions] Retrieved on [[20 September]], [[2007]].</ref>

==Biology and behavior==
Lions spend much of their time resting and are inactive for about 20&nbsp;hours per day.<ref name="Schaller122">Schaller, p. 122</ref> Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socializing, grooming and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity follow through the night hours to dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They spend an average two hours a day walking and 50&nbsp;minutes eating.<ref name="Schaller120">Schaller, p. 120<U+2013>1</ref>

===Hunting and diet===
[[Image:Female Lion.JPG|thumb|left|While a lioness such as this, has very sharp teeth, prey is usually killed by strangulation]]
Lionesses are powerful animals who usually hunt in groups and stalk their chosen prey. They can reach speeds of  {{convert|59|km/h|mi/h|-1|abbr=on}},<ref name="Schaller233">Schaller, p. 233</ref> although, only for short bursts,<ref name="Schaller2478">Schaller, p. 247<U+2013>8</ref> so they have to be close to their prey before starting the attack. They take advantage of factors that reduce visibility; many kills take place near some form of cover or at night.<ref name="Schaller237">Schaller, p. 237</ref> They sneak up to the victim until they reach a distance of approximately 30&nbsp;[[metre|m]] (98 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]]) or less. Typically, several female lions work together and encircle the herd from different points. Once they have closed with a herd, they usually target the closest prey. The attack is short and powerful, they attempt to catch the victim with a fast rush and final leap. The prey usually is  killed by strangulation.<ref>{{cite web |title=About lions - Ecology and behaviour |author=Dr Gus Mills |publisher=African Lion Working Group |url=http://www.african-lion.org/lions_e.htm |accessdate=2007-07-20 }}</ref>

The [[predation|prey]] consists mainly of large mammals, with a preference for [[wildebeest]], [[impala]]s, [[zebra]]s, [[African buffalo|buffalo]], and [[warthog]]s in Africa and [[nilgai]]; [[wild boar]] and several deer species in India. Many other species are hunted, based on availability. Mainly this will include [[ungulate]]s weighing between 50 and 300 kg such as [[kudu]], [[hartebeest]], [[gemsbok]], and [[eland]].<ref name="nowak">Ronald M. Nowak: ''Walker's Mammals of the World''.</ref> Occasionally, they take relatively small species such as [[Thomson's gazelle]] or [[Springbok Antelope|springbok]].

[[Image:Lions and a Zebra a.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The hunters of a pride sharing a zebra where the kill occurred]]
Because lionesses hunt in open spaces where they are easily seen by their prey, cooperative hunting increases the likelihood of a successful hunt; this is especially true with larger species. Teamwork also enables them to defend their prey more easily against other large predators such as hyenas, which may be attracted by [[vulture]]s over kilometers in open savannas. Lionesses do most of the hunting. In typical hunts, each lioness has a favored position in the group, either stalking prey on the "wing" then attacking, or moving a smaller distance in the centre of the group and capturing prey in flight from other lionesses.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Stander, P. E.|title=Cooperative hunting in lions: the role of the individual|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=29|issue=6|pages=445<U+2014>454|year=1992|doi=10.1007/BF00170175}}</ref>

[[Image:Maleonbuffalo.jpg<U+200E>|thumb|250px|Lions capturing an African buffalo]]
Males attached to prides do not usually participate in the hunting by the lionesses, except when the pride is hunting large animals such as giraffe and buffalo, as seen in the photograph at the right, which displays a young male biting the back of the prey he is atop while lionesses seize the legs. 

Young lions first display stalking behaviour around three months of age, although they do not participate in hunting until they are almost a year old. They begin to hunt effectively when nearing the age of two.<ref name="Schaller153">Schaller, p. 153</ref> Two or three, depending upon how quickly they mature, is the age at which males are excluded from their maternal pride.

===Reproduction===
Most lionesses will have reproduced by the time they are four years of age.<ref name ="Schaller29">Schaller, p. 29</ref> Lions do not [[mating|mate]] at any specific time of year, and the females are [[Estrous cycle#Frequency|polyestrous]].<ref name ="Schaller174">Schaller, p. 174</ref> As with other cats, the male lion's penis has spines which point backwards.

Lions reproduce very well in captivity.

[[Image:Lion pair2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|During a mating bout, a couple may copulate twenty to forty times a day for several days; the ruff of the female is clearly visible]]
The average gestation period is around 110&nbsp;days,<ref name ="Schaller174"/> the female giving birth to a litter of one to four cubs. Lionesses in a pride will synchronize their reproductive cycles so that they cooperate in the raising and suckling of the young, who suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride. Cubs usually are born and initially kept hidden from view in thickets or sheltered areas. They weigh 1.2&ndash;2.1&nbsp;kg at birth and are almost helpless, beginning to crawl a day or two after birth and walking around three weeks of age.<ref name ="Schaller143">Schaller, p. 143</ref> Weaning occurs after six to seven months. In the wild, competition for food is fierce, and as many as 80% of the cubs will die before the age of two.<ref>{{cite book |last=Macdonald |first=David |year=1984 |title=The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York |pages=31|isbn= 0-87196-871-1}}</ref>

===Group organization===
[[Image:Pride of lions.JPG|thumb|250px|A pride on the move near Govenors Camp, in the Massai Mara, Kenya]]
Lions are predatory [[carnivore]]s who manifest two types of social organization. Some are ''residents,'' living in groups, called ''prides''.<ref name ="Schaller33">Schaller, p. 33</ref> The pride usually consists of approximately five or six related females, their cubs of both sexes, and one or two males known as a ''coalition'' who mate with the adult females. The coalition of males associated with a pride are usually two, but may increase to four and decrease again over time. Male cubs are excluded from the pride when they are reaching maturity.

The second organizational behaviour is labeled, ''nomads'', who range widely and move about sporadically, either singularly or in pairs.<ref name ="Schaller33"/> Pairs are more frequent among related males who have been excluded from their birth pride. Note that a lion may switch lifestyles; nomads may become residents and vice versa. Males have to go through this lifestyle and some never are able to join another pride. A female who becomes a nomad has much greater difficulty joining a new pride, as the females in a pride are related and reject most attempts by an unrelated female to join their family group. 

The area a pride occupies is called a ''pride area'', whereas that by a nomad is a ''range''.<ref name ="Schaller33"/> The males associated with a pride tend to stay on the finges, patrolling their territory. Why [[Social behavior|sociality]]<U+2014>the most pronounced in any cat species<U+2014>has developed in lionesses is the subject of much debate. Increased hunting success appears an obvious reason, but this is less than sure upon examination: coordinated hunting does allow for more successful predation, but also ensures that non-hunting "cheaters" reduce per capita caloric intake. Other benefits include possible [[kin selection]] (better to share food with a related lion than with a stranger), protection of the young, maintenance of territory, and individual insurance against injury and hunger.<ref name=CAP/>

[[Image:Serengeti Lion Running saturated.jpg|thumb|250px|Lioness in a burst of speed while hunting in the Serengeti]] 
Lionesses do the hunting for their pride. Lionesses hunt as a co-ordinated group and are smaller, swifter, and more agile than males. They are not encumbered by the heavy and conspicuous mane which causes overheating during exertion. There is no clear hierarchy with food except the females are likely to share with each other first and allow cubs and males to eat if the kill is large enough; males will take some of this food from cubs, but are more likely to share alongside the cubs than the lionesses. Male lions will never share food they have killed by themselves. Smaller prey is eaten at the location of the hunt, thereby being shared among the hunters, when the kill is larger it often is dragged to the pride area. There is more sharing with larger kills.<ref name ="Schaller133">Schaller, p. 133</ref>
 
Both males and females defend the pride against intruders. Some individual lions consistently lead the defense against intruders, while others lag behind.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Heinsohn|first= R. |coauthors= C.

===Communication===
[[Image:Lion cub with mother.jpg|thumb|right|Head rubbing and licking are common social behaviors within a pride, this cub's mother gives it an affectionate nudge]]

Lions have an array of facial expressions and body postures that serve as visual gestures.<ref name ="Schaller92102">Schaller, p. 92<U+2013>102</ref> Their repertoire of vocalizations is also large; variations in intensity and pitch, rather than discrete signals, appear central to communication. Lion sounds include snarling, purring, hissing, coughing, miaowing, woofing and roaring. Lions most often roar at night; the sound, which can be heard from a distance of 8 km, is used to advertise the animal's presence.<ref name ="Schaller10313">Schaller, p. 103-13</ref>

===Interspecific predatory relationships===
[[Image:Fighwithhyenas.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Lioness fighting with spotted hyenas]]
The relationship between lions and [[spotted hyena]]s in areas where they coexist is unique in its complexity and intensity. Lions and spotted hyenas are both [[apex predator]]s which feed on the same prey, and are therefore in direct competition with one other. As such, they will often fight over and steal each others' kills. Though hyenas are popularly assumed to be opportunistic scavengers profiting from the lion's hunting abilities, it is quite often the case that the reverse is true. In Tanzania's Ngorongoro Crater, the spotted hyena population greatly exceeds that of the resident lions, which obtain a large proportion of their food by stealing hyena prey. The feud between the two species does however encompass more than just battles over food. In animals, it is usually the case that territorial boundaries of another species are disregarded. Hyenas and lions are an exception to this, seeing as they set boundaries against each other as they would against members of their same species. Male lions in particular are extremely aggressive toward hyenas, and have been observed to hunt and kill hyenas without eating them. Conversely, hyenas are major predators of lion cubs, and will harass lionesses over kills.<ref>http://www.wildwatch.com/living_library/mammals-2/spotted-hyena</ref><ref>http://www.lioncrusher.com/animal.asp?animal=75</ref> However, healthy adult males, even single ones, are generally avoided at all costs.

Lions tend to dominate smaller felines such as [[cheetah]]s and [[leopard]]s in areas where they are sympatric. They will steal their kills and will kill their cubs and even adults when given the chance. In the case of the cheetah, it has a 50% chance of losing its kill to lions and other predators.<ref>O'Brien, S., D. Wildt, M. Bush (1986). "The Cheetah in Genetic Peril". Scientific American 254: 68-76.</ref> Lions are major killers of cheetah cubs. 90% of cheetah cubs die in their early weeks of life by lions and other predators. Cheetahs avoid competition by hunting at different times of the day. Cheetah cubs are hidden in thick brush. Leopards also use such tactics. However, they have more of an advantage as they can subsist on small prey much more than both lions and cheetahs. Also, unlike cheetahs, leopards can climb trees and can use them to keep their cubs and kills safe from lions. However, lionesses will occasionally be successful in climbing and fetching leopard kills.<ref name ="Schaller293">Schaller, p. 293</ref>

Until the late [[Pleistocene]] (about 10,000 years ago), the lion was the most widespread land mammal aside from man. They were found in most of Africa, much of Eurasia from western Europe to India and the [[Bering land bridge]], and in the Americas from [[Yukon]] to Peru. Parts of this range were occupied by subspecies that are extinct today.

Most lions now live in eastern and southern Africa, and their numbers there are rapidly decreasing, with an estimated 30<U+2013>50% decline over the last two decades.<ref name=IUCN/> Currently, estimates of the African lion population range between 16,500 and 47,000 living in the wild in 2002<U+2013>2004,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bauer H, Van Der Merwe S |year= 2002|title=The African lion database |journal=Cat news |volume=36 |issue= |pages=41<U+2013>53 }}</ref><ref>{{citation |author=Chardonnet P |year=2002|title=Conservation of African lion|publisher =International Foundation for the Conservation of Wildlife|location=Paris, France}}</ref> down from early 1990s estimates that ranged as high as 100,000 and perhaps 400,000 in 1950.

Therefore the lion is considered a [[vulnerable species]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]], while the Asiatic subspecies is [[critically endangered]]. The lion population in the region of West Africa is isolated from lion populations of Central Africa, with little or no exchange of breeding individuals. The number of mature individuals in West Africa is estimated by two separate recent surveys at 850&ndash;1,160 (2002/2004). There is disagreement over the size of the largest individual population in West Africa: the estimates range from 100 to 400 lions in [[Burkina Faso]]'s [[Arly-Singou]] ecosystem.<ref name=IUCN/>

Conservation of both African and Asian lions has required the setup and maintenance of national parks and game reserves; among the best known are [[Etosha National Park]] in [[Namibia]], [[Serengeti National Park]] in Tanzania and [[Kruger National Park]] in eastern [[South Africa]].

The former popularity of the Barbary lion as a zoo animal has meant that scattered lions in captivity are likely to be descended from Barbary lion stock. This includes twelve lions at [[Port Lympne Zoo|Port Lympne Wild Animal Park]] in [[Kent]], [[England]] that are descended from animals owned by the [[King of Morocco]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bigcatrescue.org/barbary_lion_news.htm |title=Barbary Lion News |accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> Another eleven animals believed to be Barbary lions were found in [[Addis Ababa]] zoo, descendants of animals owned by [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia|Emperor Haile Selassie]].

Following the discovery of the decline of lion population in Africa, several co-ordinated efforts involving lion [[Wildlife conservation|conservation]] have been organised in an attempt to stem this decline.
Lions are one species included in the [[Species Survival Plan]], a coordinated attempt by the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] to increase its chances of survival. The plan was originally started in 1982 for the Asiatic lion, but was suspended when it was found that most North American lions were not [[Genetic pollution|genetically pure]], having been hybridized with African lions. The African lion plan started in 1993, focusing especially on the South African subspecies, although there are difficulties in assessing the genetic diversity of captive lions, since most individuals are of unknown origins, making maintenance of genetic diversity a problem.<ref name="zoos_encyclopedia"/>

===Man-eaters===
While lions do not usually hunt people, some (usually males) seem to seek out human prey; well-publicized cases include the [[Tsavo maneaters]], where 28 railway workers were taken by lions over nine months during the construction of a railway bridge over the [[Tsavo River]] in [[Kenya]] in 1898, and the 1991 [[Mfuwe]] man-eater, which killed six people in the Laungwa River Valley in [[Zambia]].<ref>{{cite web | coauthors=Wayne Hosek | title=Man-eaters of the Field Museum: Lion of Mfuwe | work=Field Museum of Natural History | publisher=Field Museum of Natural History | date=2007| url =http://www.fieldmuseum.org/exhibits/exhibit_sites/tsavo/mfuwe.html | accessdate =2007-09-16}}</ref> In both, the hunters who killed the lions wrote books detailing the animals' predatory behavior. The Mfuwe and Tsavo incidents bear similarities: the lions in both incidents were larger than normal, lacked manes, and seemed to suffer from [[tooth decay]]. The infirmity theory, including tooth decay, is not favored by all researchers.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} An analysis of teeth and jaws of man-eating lions in museum collections suggests that, while tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey depletion in human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on humans.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Patterson |first=Bruce D. |coauthors=Ellis J.

The lion's proclivity for man-eating has been systematically examined. American and Tanzanian scientists report that man-eating behavior in rural areas of Tanzania increased greatly from 1990 to 2005. At least 563 villagers were attacked and many eaten over this period&mdash;a number far exceeding the more famed "Tsavo" incidents of a century earlier. The incidents occurred near [[Selous Game Reserve|Selous National Park]] in [[Rufiji River|Rufiji District]] and in [[Lindi Region|Lindi Province]] near the [[Mozambique|Mozambican]] border. While the expansion of villagers into bush country is one concern, the authors argue that conservation policy must mitigate the danger because, in this case, conservation contributes directly to human deaths. Cases in Lindi have been documented where lions seize humans from the center of substantial villages.<ref name="Packer05">{{cite journal |last=Packer |first=C. |coauthors=Ikanda, D.; Kissui, B.; Kushnir, H. |year=2005 |month=August |title=Conservation biology: lion attacks on humans in Tanzania |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=436 |issue=7053 |pages=927<U+2013>928 |doi=10.1038/436927a| pmid=16107828}}</ref>

Author Robert R.

Packer estimates more than 200 Tanzanians are killed each year by lions, [[crocodile]]s, elephants, hippos and [[snake]]s, and that the numbers could be double that amount, with lions thought to kill at least 70 of those. Packer and Ikanda are among the few [[conservation movement|conservationists]] who believe western conservation efforts must take account of these matters not just because of ethical concerns about human life, but also for the long term success of conservation efforts and lion preservation.<ref name="Packer05"/>

The "All-Africa" record of man-eating generally is considered to be not Tsavo, but the lesser-known incidents in the late 1930s through the late 1940s in what was then [[Tanganyika]] (now Tanzania). George Rushby, game warden and professional hunter, eventually dispatched the pride, which over three generations is thought to have killed and eaten 1,500 to 2,000 in what is now [[Njombe]] district.<ref>{{cite book |author=Rushby GG |title= No More the Tusker |year= 1965 |publisher=W.

Seraglios served as expressions of the nobility's power and wealth. Animals such as big cats and [[elephant]]s, in particular, symbolized power, and would be pitted in fights against each other or domesticated animals. By extension, menageries and seraglios served as demonstrations of the dominance of man over nature. Consequently, the defeat of such natural "lords" by a cow in 1682 astonished the spectators, and the flight of an elephant before a rhinoceros drew jeers. Such fights would slowly fade out in the seventeenth century with the spread of the menagerie and their appropriation by the commoners. The tradition of keeping big cats as pets would last into the nineteenth century, at which time it was seen as highly eccentric.<ref>Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, pp. 24<U+2013>28.</ref>

The wild animals trade flourished alongside improved colonial trade of the nineteenth century. Lions were considered fairly common and inexpensive.

There have also been instances where a lion was kept by a private individual, such as [[Elsa the Lioness]], who was raised by [[George Adamson]] and his wife [[Joy Adamson]] and came to develop a strong bonds with them, particularly the latter. The lioness later achieved fame, her life being documented on a series of books and films.

===Baiting and taming===

Lion-baiting is a [[blood sport]] involving the [[Bait (dogs)|baiting]] of lions in combat with other animals, usually dogs. Records of it exist in ancient times through until the seventeenth century. It was finally banned in [[Vienna]] by 1800 and England in 1825.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hone |first= William |editor= Kyle Grimes|title= The Every-Day Book |origyear=1825<U+2013>26 |url=http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/day-pages/207-july26.html |accessdate=2007-09-05 |year=2004 |publisher=University of Alabama at Birmingham |pages=26 |chapter=July |chapterurl=http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/indices/index.html#jul}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Blaisdell |first=Warren H. |year=1997 |month=November |title= How A Lion Fight Caused England To Stop The Breeding Of Both Ring And Pit Bulldogs|journal=American Bulldog Review |volume=3 |issue=4 |url=http://www.american-bulldog.com/how_a_lion.htm |accessdate= 2007-09-05}}</ref>

Lion taming refers to the practice of taming lions for entertainment, either as part of an established [[circus]] or as an individual act, such as [[Siegfried & Roy]]. The term is also often used for the taming and display of other big cats such as [[tiger|tigers]], [[leopard|leopards]] and [[cougar|cougars]]. The practice was pioneered in the first half of the nineteenth century by Frenchman [[Henri Martin (tamer)|Henri Martin]] and American [[Isaac Van Amburgh]] who both toured widely, and whose techniques were copied by a number of followers.<ref name="baratay187">Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, p. 187.</ref> Van Amburgh performed before Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom]] in 1838 when he toured [[Great Britain]]. Martin composed a [[pantomime]] titled ''Les Lions de Mysore'' ("the lions of Mysore"), an idea that Amburgh quickly borrowed. These acts eclipsed [[equestrianism]] acts as the central display of circus shows, but truly entered public consciousness in the early twentieth century with cinema. In demonstrating the superiority of man over animal, lion taming served a purpose similar to animal fights of previous centuries.<ref name="baratay187">Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, p. 187.</ref> The now iconic lion tamer's chair was possibly first used by American [[Clyde Beatty]] (1903<U+2013>1965).<ref>{{cite book | first=David | last=Feldman | authorlink=David Feldman (author) | coauthors= | year=1993 | title=How Does Aspirin Find a Headache? | edition= | publisher=HarperCollins | location= | isbn= 0-06-016923-0 }}</ref>

===Cultural depictions===
{{details|Cultural depictions of lions}}
[[Image:GD-EG-KomOmbo016.JPG|thumb|upright|left|The warrior goddess [[Sekhmet]], shown with her sun disk and cobra crown]]
The Lion has been an icon for humanity for thousands of years, appearing in cultures across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Despite incidents of attacks on humans, lions have enjoyed a positive depiction in culture as strong but noble. A common depiction is their representation as "[[Monarch|king]] of the jungle" or "king of the beasts"; hence, the lion has been a popular symbol of royalty and stateliness,<ref name ="Garai73">{{cite book |last=Garai |first=Jana |title=The Book of Symbols |year=1973 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn=671-21773-9}}</ref> as well as a symbol of bravery; it is featured in several [[Aesop's Fables|fables]] of the
[[6th century BC|sixth century BC]] [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] storyteller [[Aesop]].<ref>{{cite book| author=Aesop|coauthors= Gibbs L |title=Aesop's Fables |series=Oxford World's Classics |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0192840509}}</ref>

Representations of lions date back 32,000 years; the [[Lion man|lion-headed]] ivory carving from Vogelherd cave in the [[Swabian Alb]] in southwestern [[Germany]] has been determined to be about 32,000 years old from the [[Aurignacian]] culture.<ref name="BurgerJ-Molecular-phylogeny"/> Two lions were depicted mating in the Chamber of Felines in 15,000 year old [[Paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s in the [[Lascaux]] caves. Cave lions are also depicted in the [[Chauvet Cave]], discovered in 1994; this has been dated at 32,000 years of age,<ref name="Packer00"/> though it may be of similar or younger age to Lascaux.<ref>{{cite conference| first=Christian | last=Z<U+00FC>chner | title=Grotte Chauvet Archaeologically Dated | date=September 1998 | location=International Rock Art Congress IRAC <U+00B4>98 - Vila Real <U+2013> Portugal | url=http://www.uf.uni-erlangen.de/chauvet/chauvet.html | accessdate =2007-08-27}}</ref>

[[Ancient Egypt]] venerated the lioness (the fierce hunter) as their [[war god|war deities]] and among those in the [[Egyptian pantheon]] are, [[Bast]], [[Mafdet]], [[Menhit]], [[Pakhet]], [[Sekhmet]], [[Tefnut]], and the [[Sphinx]]; <ref name ="Garai73"/>  Among the Egyptian pantheon also are sons of these goddesses such as, [[Maahes]], and, as attested by Egyptians as a [[Nubia]]n deity, [[Dedun]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Cass S | title=Maahes | work=Encyclopedia Mythica | publisher=Encyclopedia Mythica | date=1998| url=http://www.pantheon.org/articles/m/maahes.html | accessdate=2007-09-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=Lindemans MF | title=Dedun | work=Encyclopedia Mythica | publisher=Encyclopedia Mythica | date=1997 | url=http://www.pantheon.org/articles/d/dedun.html | accessdate=2007-09-14}}</ref>

Careful examination of the lion deities noted in many ancient cultures reveal that many are lioness also. Admiration for the co-operative hunting strategies of lionesses was evident in very ancient times. Most of the ''lion gates'' depict lionesses. The [[Nemean Lion]] was symbolic in Ancient Greece and Rome, represented as the constellation and zodiac sign [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]], and described in mythology, where its skin was borne by the hero [[Heracles]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Graves |first=R |authorlink=Robert Graves |title=Greek Myths |year=1955|publisher=Penguin |location=London |isbn=0-14-001026-2|pages=465<U+2013>469 |chapter=The First Labour:The Nemean Lion}}</ref>

The lion was a prominent symbol in both the [[Old Babylonian]] and [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] periods. The classic Babylonian lion motif, found as a statue, carved or painted on walls, is often referred to as the ''striding lion of Babylon''. It is in Babylon that the biblical [[Daniel]] is said to have been delivered from the lion's den.<ref>[[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 6</ref> Such symbolism was appropriated by Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq for their [[Lion of Babylon tank]], with the technology adapted from a Russian model.

[[Narasimha]] ("man-lion") is described as an incarnation ([[avatara]]) of [[Vishnu]] within the [[Puranic]] texts of [[Hinduism]];<ref> [http://srimadbhagavatam.com/1/3/18/en1 Bhag-P 1.3.18] "In the fourteenth incarnation, the Lord appeared as Nrisimha and bifurcated the strong body of the atheist Hiranyakasipu with His nails, just as a carpenter pierces cane." </ref> who takes the form of half-man / half-[[Asiatic Lions|lion]], having a human torso and lower body, but with a lion-like face and claws.<ref> [http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/8/19-22/en1 Bhag-P 7.8.19<U+2013>22] </ref> it is worshiped as "Lion God" thus Indian or [[Asiatic lion]]s which were commonly found throughout most of India in ancient times are considered sacred by all [[Hindus]] in India.

[[Singh]] is an [[ancient]] [[India]]n [[Vedic Sanskrit|vedic]] name meaning "Lion" ([[Asiatic lion]]), dating back over 2000 years to [[ancient India]]. It was originally only used by [[Rajputs]] a [[Hindu]] [[Kshatriya]] or military [[caste]] in India. After the birth of the [[Khalsa]] brotherhood in 1699, the [[Sikh]]s also adopted the name "Singh" due to the wishes of [[Guru Gobind Singh]]. Along with millions of Hindu Rajputs today, it is also used by over 20 million [[Sikhs]] worldwide.<ref>Dr. McCleod, Head of Sikh Studies, Department of South Asian Studies, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.<!--I thought we only cited published sources?--></ref><ref>Khushwant Singh, ''A History of the Sikhs, Volume I''</ref>

Found famously on numerous [[Flags]] and [[Coat of Arms]] all across Asia and Europe, the Asiatic lions also stand firm on the [[National Emblem of India]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Government of India | title=Know India: State Emblem | work=National Portal of India | publisher=National Informatics Centre | date=2005 | url=http://india.gov.in/knowindia/state_emblem.php | accessdate =2007-08-27}}</ref>.

The Asiatic lion is a common motif in [[Chinese art]]. They were first used in art during the late [[Spring and Autumn Period]] (fifth or sixth century BC), and became much more popular during the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC-AD 220), when [[imperial guardian lions]] started to be placed in front of imperial palaces for protection. Because lions have never been native to China, early depictions were somewhat unrealistic; after the introduction of [[Buddhist art]] to China in the [[Tang Dynasty]] (after the sixth century AD), lions were usually depicted without wings, their bodies became thicker and shorter, and their manes became curly.<ref>Li Ling (May 2002).

"Lion" was the nickname of medieval warrior rulers with a reputation for bravery, such as [[Richard I of England]], known as Richard the Lionheart,<ref name ="Garai73"/>,  [[Henry the Lion]] ([[German language|German]]: ''Heinrich der L<U+00F6>we''), [[Duke of Saxony]] and [[Robert III of Flanders]] nicknamed "The Lion of Flanders" - a major [[Flemish]] national hero up to the present. Lions were frequently depicted on [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], either as a device on shields themselves, or as [[supporters]].
