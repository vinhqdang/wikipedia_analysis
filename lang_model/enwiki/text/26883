'''''Halloween II''''' is a 1981 [[horror film]] directed by [[Rick Rosenthal]], and written by [[John Carpenter]] and [[Debra Hill]]. It is the second installment in the [[Halloween (franchise)|''Halloween'' series]] and is a direct [[sequel]] to ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', immediately picking up where it had left off, set on the same night of October 31, 1978 as the seemingly unkillable [[Michael Myers (character)|Michael Myers]] continues to follow [[Laurie Strode]] ([[Jamie Lee Curtis]]) to a nearby hospital while [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Sam Loomis]] ([[Donald Pleasence]]) is still in pursuit of his patient.

Stylistically, ''Halloween II'' reproduces certain key elements that made the original ''Halloween'' a success, such as first-person camera perspectives and unexceptional settings. The sequel was a box office success, grossing over $25.5 million in the United States. 

Originally, ''Halloween II'' was intended to be the last chapter of the ''Halloween'' series to revolve around Michael Myers and Haddonfield,<ref name="HIIIinfo">{{cite web| year = 2001| url = http://www.halloweenmovies.com/filmarchive/h3bts.htm| title = Halloween III: Season of the Witch, Behind the Scenes| work= HalloweenMovies.com| publisher = Trancas International Films|accessdate= April 19, 2006}}</ref> but after the lacklustre reaction to ''[[Halloween III: Season of the Witch]]'' (1982), the Michael Myers character was brought back seven years later in ''[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers]]'' (1988).

==Plot==
The film picks up immediately where the [[Halloween (1978 film)|first film]] had left off. On October 31, 1978, Laurie Strode ([[Jamie Lee Curtis]]) is sent to the hospital due to the injuries inflicted by Michael Myers while Dr. Loomis ([[Donald Pleasence]]) attempts to track him down after he had gone missing after being shot six times and falling from a second story window. Meanwhile, Michael is still in the area, he steals a knife from a neighbors house and kills a girl named Alice in a nearby house as he seeks shelter to recover from his injuries; He later learns of Laurie's location from a radio broadcast and makes his way to Haddonfield Memorial hospital. Laurie begins having flashbacks of being adopted by the Strodes and visiting a young boy in a mental institution; her sedation leaving her in a semi-conscious state most of the time, and her friend Jimmy Lloyd ([[Lance Guest]]) begins to worry about her, developing romantic feelings for her despite the chagrin of the head nurse who is trying to keep her resting comfortably. Dr. Loomis and Sheriff Brackett continue to search for Michael, only for an oncoming speeding police car to accidentally hit and kill Ben Tramer (who was dressed for Halloween wearing a mask similar to Michael's and was Laurie's crush in the first movie), in the process.

Michael kills the security guard, Mr. Garrett, with a claw hammer and moves on into the hospital after the business hours come to a close. He begins killing off the hospital staff by whatever means come available, strangling one of the ambulance attendants named Budd and drowning his nurse companion Karen in a scalding hot tub. He cuts off the phone lines, cutting off all communications with the outside world which rouses Laurie's suspicions when she discovers the phones aren't working. He kills the head physician Dr. Mixter and a nurse named Janet by injecting air into their eye sockets via needles, and Laurie attempts to flee before Michael can find her.

Meanwhile, Loomis follows clues connecting Michael to [[Samhain]] and the occult which might explain his seeming indestructibility, but he is interrupted by a nurse from the mental institution who says she had been ordered to take him back under the enforcement of a US Marshal. En route, she tells Loomis that Laurie Strode is Michael Myers's younger sister and Loomis realizes that she is his target before Loomis forcibly ordering the trooper to turn around after firing a warning shot. While searching around the hospital, Jimmy eventually discovers the head nurse, Mrs. Alves, strapped to a table in one of the surgery rooms, drained of her blood.  While trying to hurry out of the room, Jimmy slips, falls, and gets a concussion which renders him unconscious. 

Meanwhile nurse Jill finds a sedated Laurie walking around and is killed when Michael stabs her in the back with a scalpel. Laurie manages to barely escape Michael by going through the boiler room and up to the parking lot outside, discovering the security guard's body along the way. She is unable to start any cars and also notices that all of the tires have been flattened, presumably by Michael who had earlier overheard her and Jimmy discussing one of them driving to the police department to get help. Jimmy eventually makes it out of the hospital and out to his car to seek help, but faints and falls unconscious again from the earlier massive [[concussion]] while trying to start his car as he and Laurie attempt to escape the hospital. Loomis, the nurse and trooper arrive and just barely save Laurie from being killed by Michael. The nurse goes to the police car to call for help, Michael cuts the trooper's throat, and Loomis and Laurie flee into the operating rooms. Laurie shoots out both Michael's eyes, causing him to blindly swing at them. Loomis fills the room with ether and oxygen gas using the distraction to allow Laurie to escape. Then he ignites it, blowing up the surgery room in the process and evidently immolating them both in the fire.

At daybreak, Laurie is loaded onto an ambulance, having visions of Michael's burning body as she is driven off to safety. In the alternate ending, she sees a familiar shape sit up on the stretcher beside her in the ambulance, which turns out to be Jimmy Lloyd.

==Production==
===Development===
Carpenter and Hill, the writers of the first ''Halloween'', had originally considered setting the sequel a few years after the events of ''Halloween''. They planned to have Myers track Laurie Strode to her new home in a high-rise apartment building.<ref name="HIIIinfo"/> However, the setting was later changed to Haddonfield Hospital in script meetings.

''Halloween'' producers [[Irwin Yablans]] and [[Moustapha Akkad]] invested heavily in the sequel, boasting a much larger budget than its predecessor: $2.5 million (compared to only $320,000 for the original) even though Carpenter refused to direct. Most of the film was shot at Morningside Hospital in Los Angeles, California, and Pasadena Community Hospital in Pasadena, California.<ref name="Hillinterview">Hill interview, ''Fangoria'', quoted at [http://www.halloweenmovies.com/filmarchive/h2bts.htm HalloweenMovies.com]; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref> There was discussion of filming ''Halloween II'' in [[3-D film|3-D]]; Hill said, "We investigated a number of 3-D processes ... but they were far too expensive for this particular project. Also, most of the projects we do involve a lot of night shooting<U+2014>evil lurks at night. It's hard to do that in 3-D."<ref name="Hillinterview"/> 

The sequel was intended to conclude the story of Michael Myers and Laurie Strode. The third film, ''Halloween III: Season of the Witch'', released a year later, contained a plot that deviated wholly from that of the first two films.<ref name="HIIIinfo"/> [[Tommy Lee Wallace]], the director of ''Halloween III'', stated "It is our intention to create an anthology out of the series, sort of along the lines of ''[[Night Gallery]]'', or ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', only on a much larger scale, of course."<ref>Tommy Lee Wallace interview, in Ellen Carlomagno, "Halloween III: Season of the Witch: An On-The-Set Report On The Ambitious Sequel to Carpenter's Classic!", ''Fangoria'', #22, October 1982, p. 8, available [http://watchthemagicpumpkin.com/gallery/album01/fangoria22_1?full=1 here]; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref> When asked, in a 1982 interview, what happened to Myers and Loomis, Carpenter flatly answered, "The Shape is dead. Pleasence's character is dead, too, unfortunately."<ref name="CarpenterinterviewTZM">Carpenter, interview with ''Twilight Zone Magazine'', November 1982, available [http://web.archive.org/web/20040804071029/http://www.geocities.com/hollywood/academy/9412/interview2.html here]; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref> Neither Carpenter nor Hill were involved in the later sequels that featured Michael Myers again.

===Writing===
The screenplay of ''Halloween II'' was written by Carpenter and Hill. In a 1981 interview with ''[[Fangoria (magazine)|Fangoria]]'' magazine, Hill mentions the finished film differs somewhat from initial drafts of the screenplay.<ref name="HIIIinfo"/> The plot twist of Laurie being Michael's sister required a [[retcon]] of the timeline between Judith's murder and the events depicted in the first ''Halloween''; while Michael Myers is said to have committed the crime fifteen years ago and to be twenty-one. 

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]], who was a big admirer of the first film, notes that the plot of the sequel was rather simple: "The plot of ''Halloween II'' absolutely depends, of course, on our old friend the [[Idiot Plot]], which requires that everyone in the movie behave at all times like an idiot. That's necessary because if anyone were to use common sense, the problem would be solved and the movie would be over."<ref name="Ebertreview">Roger Ebert, review of ''Halloween II'', Chicago ''Sun-Times'', January 1, 1981, at [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19810101/REVIEWS/101010336/1023 RogerEbert.com]; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref> Characters were described as shallow and like cardboard<!--is that a quote?-->. Hill rebuffed such critiques by arguing that "in a thriller film, what a character says is often irrelevant, especially in those sequences where the objective is to build up suspense."<ref>Hill, quoted in Robert E. Kapsis, ''Hitchcock: The Making of a Reputation'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 172, ISBN 0-226-42489-8.</ref>

Historian Nicholas Rogers suggests that a portion of the film seems to have drawn inspiration from the "contemporary controversies surrounding the holiday itself."<ref name="Rogers">Nicholas Rogers, ''Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 121, ISBN 0-19-516896-8.</ref> He points specifically to the scene in the film when a young boy in a pirate costume arrives at Haddonfield Memorial Hospital with a razor blade lodged in his mouth, a reference to the urban legend of tainted Halloween candy.<ref>Barbara Mikkelson, "Pins and Needles", at [http://www.snopes.com/horrors/mayhem/needles.asp Snopes.com]; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref> According to Rogers, "The ''Halloween'' films opened in the wake of the billowing stories about Halloween sadism and clearly traded on the uncertainties surrounding trick-or-treating and the general safety of the festival."<ref name="Rogers">Rogers, ''Halloween'', p. 121.</ref>

===Casting===
The main cast of ''Halloween'' reprised their roles in the sequel with the exception of [[Nick Castle]], who had played the adult Michael Myers in the original. Veteran English actor Pleasence continued the role of Dr. Sam Loomis, who had been Myers' psychiatrist for the past 15 years while Myers was institutionalized at Smith's Grove Sanitarium. Curtis (then 22), again played the teenage babysitter Laurie Strode, the younger sister of Myers. Curtis required a wig for the role of long-haired Laurie Strode, as she had her own hair cut shorter. Charles Cyphers reprised the role of Sheriff Leigh Brackett, but his character disappears from the film when the corpse of his daughter Annie ([[Nancy Kyes]]) is discovered. Actor [[Hunter von Leer]] heads the manhunt for Myers in the role of Deputy Gary Hunt. He admitted in an interview that he had never watched ''Halloween'' before being cast in the part. He stated, "I did not see the original first but being from a small town, I wanted the Deputy to have compassion."

Stunt performer [[Dick Warlock]] played Michael Myers (as in ''Halloween'', listed as "The Shape" in the credits), replacing Castle who was beginning a career as a director. Warlock's previous experience in film was as a stunt double in films, such as ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'' (1968) and ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975), and the 1974 television series ''[[Kolchak: The Night Stalker]]''.<ref>{{IMDb name|id=0006441|name=Dick Warlock}}; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref> In an interview, Warlock explained how he prepared for the role since Myers received far more screen time in the sequel than the original. Warlock said,<blockquote>''[I watched the scenes] where Laurie is huddled in the closet. Michael breaks through. She grabs a hanger and thrusts it up and into his eyes. Michael falls down and Laurie walks to the bedroom doorway and sits down. In the background, we see Michael sit up and turn towards her to the beat of the music. ... Anyway, that and the head tilt were the things I carried with me into ''Halloween II''. I didn't really see that much more to hang my hat on in the first film.''<ref>Dick Warlock, interview with [http://www.pitofhorror.com/newdesign/halloween/warlock.html PitofHorror.com]; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref></blockquote> Warlock also claims that the mask he wore was the same one as used by Nick Castle in the first film. Hill confirmed this in an interview.<ref name="Hillinterview"/> 

The supporting cast consisted of relatively unknown actors and actresses, except for [[Jeffrey Kramer]] and [[Ford Rainey]]. Most of the cast previously or later appeared in films or television series by [[Universal Studios]] (the distributor for this film). Kramer was previously cast in a supporting role as Deputy Jeff Hendricks in ''Jaws'' and ''[[Jaws 2]]'' (1978). In ''Halloween II'', Kramer played Dr. Graham, a dentist who examines the charred remains of a boy confused with Myers. Rainey was an actor well known for his supporting roles on television shows such as ''[[Bonanza]]'', ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' and ''[[The Bionic Woman]]''. He was chosen to play Haddonfield Memorial Hospital's drunk resident doctor, Frederick Mixter.<ref>{{IMDb name|id=0707077|name=Ford Rainey}}; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref> A host of character actors were cast as the hospital's staff. Many were acquaintances of director Rosenthal. He told an interviewer, "I'd been studying acting with [[Milton Katselas]] at the Beverly Hills Playhouse and I brought many people from the Playhouse into ''Halloween 2''."<ref name="RosenthalFord">Luke Ford, interview with Rosenthal, March 12, 2002, at [http://www.lukeford.net/profiles/profiles/rick_rosenthal.htm LukeFord.net]; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref> These included [[Leo Rossi]], [[Pamela Susan Shoop]], [[Ana Alicia]] and [[Gloria Gifford]]. Rossi played the part of Budd Scarlotti, a hypersexual EMS driver who mocks Jimmy as a "college boy." Rossi would go on to have minor roles in television series such as ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' and ''Falcone'' and several [[direct-to-video]] releases.<ref>{{IMDb name|id=0744235|name=Leo Rossi}}; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref><ref>Leo Rossi biography, at [http://www.halloweenmovies.com/filmarchive/cast/lr.htm HalloweenMovies.com]; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref> 

Shoop played Nurse Karen Bailey, who is scalded to death by Myers in the hospital therapy tub. Featured in the only nude scene in the film, Shoop discussed filming the scene in an interview: "Now that was hard! The water was freezing cold, and poor Leo Rossi and I could barely keep our teeth from chattering! The water was also pretty dirty and I ended up with an ear infection."<ref>Pamela Susan Shoop interview, quoted at [http://www.lukeford.net/profiles/profiles/rick_rosenthal.htm LukeFord.net]; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref> Before working with Rosenthal, she had made several cameo appearances on television series such as ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'', ''[[B. J. and the Bear]]'', and later made appearances on ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' and ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]''.<ref>Pamela Susan Shoop biography, at [http://www.halloweenmovies.com/filmarchive/cast/pss.htm HalloweenMovies.com]; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref> Gifford and Alicia played minor supporting roles as head nurse Mrs. Virginia Alves and orderly Janet Marshall.  Ana Alicia went on to star for 8 seasons on the highly successful CBS serial, ''[[Falcon Crest]]''. Actor [[Lance Guest]] played an EMS driver, Jimmy Lloyd<!--sounds like personal opinion:(who is later assumed to have married Strode and fathered a child with her, [[Jamie Lloyd]], of ''Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers'' origin, although there's no solid evidence to back this up)-->. In much the same way as the original ''Halloween'' had launched the career of Curtis, after ''Halloween II'', Guest went on to star in such films as ''[[The Last Starfighter]]'' (1984) and ''[[Jaws: The Revenge]]'' (1987) and the television series ''[[Life Goes On (TV series)|Life Goes On]]''.<ref>{{IMDb name|id=0346411|name=Lance Guest}}; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref> ''The Last Starfighter'' director Nick Castle stated in an interview, "When I was assigned to the film, Lance Guest was the first name I wrote down on my list for Alex after seeing him in ''Halloween II''." Castle adds, "He possessed all the qualities I wanted the character to express on the screen, a kind of innocence, shyness, yet determination."<ref>Nick Castle interview, quoted at [http://starfighter.photoweborama.com/iviews/guest.html Starfighter.photoweborama.com]; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref>

===Directing===
Carpenter refused to direct the sequel and originally approached [[Tommy Lee Wallace]], the art director from the original ''Halloween'', to take the helm. Carpenter told one interviewer, "I had made that film once and I really didn't want to do it again."<ref>Carpenter interview, ''Famous Monsters'' magazine, quoted at [http://www.halloweenmovies.com/filmarchive/h2bts.htm HalloweenMovies.com]; last accessed April 19, 2006</ref> After Wallace declined, Carpenter chose Rosenthal, a relatively unknown and inexperienced director whose previous credits included episodes of the television series ''Secrets of Midland Heights'' (1980<U+2013>1981). In an interview with ''[[Twilight Zone literature|Twilight Zone Magazine]]'', Carpenter explains that Rosenthal was chosen because "he did a terrific short called ''Toyer''. It was full of suspense and tension and terrific performances."<ref name="CarpenterinterviewTZM"/><ref name="behindthescenes">Behind the Scenes, ''Halloween II'', at [http://www.halloweenmovies.com/filmarchive/h2bts.htm HalloweenMovies.com]; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref>

[[Image:HalloweenII title.jpg|left|thumb|The opening title of ''Halloween II'', an attempt to connect the film stylistically to ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', featuring the lit pumpkin as a back drop to the opening credits.]]

Stylistically, Rosenthal attempted to recreate the elements and themes of the original film. The opening title features a jack-o'-lantern that splits in half to reveal a human skull. In the original, the camera zoomed in on the jack-o'-lantern's left eye.  The first scene of the film is presented through a first-person camera format in which a voyeuristic Michael Myers enters an elderly couple's home and steals a knife from the kitchen. Rosenthal attempts to reproduce the "jump" scenes present in ''Halloween'', but does not film Myers on the periphery, which is where he appeared in many of the scenes of the original. Under Rosenthal's direction, Myers is the central feature of a majority of the scenes. In an interview with [[Luke Ford]], Rosenthal explains,<blockquote>''The first movie I ever did ''[Halloween II]'' was a sequel, but it was supposed to be a direct continuation. It started one minute after the first movie ended. You have to try hard to maintain the style of the first movie. I wanted it to feel like a two-parter. You have the responsibility and the restraints of the style that's been set. It was the same crew. My philosophy was to do more of a thriller than a slasher movie.''<ref name="RosenthalFord"/></blockquote>
[[File:HalloweenIIscreencap.jpg|thumb|right|''Halloween II'' departs significantly from its predecessor by incorporating more graphic violence and gore, making it far more similar to [[slasher film]]s of its time. This scene depicts a bleeding Michael after being shot in both eyes.]]

The decision to include more gore and nudity in the sequel was not made by Rosenthal, who contends that it was Carpenter who chose to make the film much bloodier than the original.<ref>Bill Chambers, review of ''Halloween II'' at [http://www.filmfreakcentral.net/dvdreviews/halloweenii.htm FilmFreakCentral.net]; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref> According to the film's official website, "Carpenter came in and directed a few sequences to clean up some of Rosenthal's work."<ref name="behindthescenes"/> One reviewer of the film notes that "Carpenter, concerned that the picture would be deemed too 'tame' by the slasher audience, re-filmed several death scenes with more gore."<ref name="Berardinellireview">James Berardinelli, [http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=668 ''Halloween II''], [http://www.reelviews.net/movies.php ReelViews.com]; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref> When asked about his role in the directing process, Carpenter told an interviewer:<blockquote>''That's a long, long story. That was a project I got involved in as a result of several different kinds of pressure. I had no influence over the direction of the film. I had an influence in the [[post-production]]. I saw a rough cut of ''Halloween II'', and it wasn't scary. It was about as scary as ''[[Quincy, M.E.|Quincy]]''. So we had to do some post-production work to bring it at least up to par with the competition.''<ref name="CarpenterinterviewTZM"/></blockquote>

Rosenthal was not pleased with Carpenter's changes. He reportedly complained that Carpenter "ruined [my] carefully paced film."<ref>Justin Kerswell, "Slash with Panache?", review of ''Halloween II'' at [http://www.hysteria-lives.co.uk/hysterialives/Hysteria/halloween2.htm Hysteria-Lives.co.uk]; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref> Regardless, many of the graphic scenes contained elements not seen before in film. Roger Ebert claims, "This movie has the first close-up I can remember of a hypodermic needle being inserted into an eyeball."<ref name="Ebertreview"/> The film is often categorized as a [[splatter film]] rather than a [[slasher film]] due to the elevated level of gore. Film critic John McCarty writes of splatter films: "[They] aim not to scare their audiences, necessarily, nor to drive them to the edge of their seats in suspense, but to mortify them with scenes of explicit gore. In splatter movies, mutilation is indeed the message ...."<ref>John McCarty, ''The Official Splatter Movie Guide'' (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1989), ISBN 0-312-02958-6, quoted at [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19810101/REVIEWS/101010336/1023 RogerEbert.com]; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref> Rosenthal later directed the eighth film in the ''Halloween'' series, ''[[Halloween: Resurrection]]'' (2002).

===Music===
The film's score was a variation of Carpenter compositions from ''Halloween'', particularly the main theme's familiar piano melody played in a [[Time signature|compound 5/4 time]] [[Metre (music)|rhythm]]. The score was performed on a synthesizer organ rather than a piano<!--as in the first film?-->.<ref>Alan Howarth biography, at [http://www.halloweenmovies.com/filmarchive/cast/ah.htm HalloweenMovies.com]; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref> One reviewer for the [[BBC]] described the revised score as having "a more gothic feel." The reviewer asserted that it "doesn't sound quite as good as the original piece", but "it still remains a classic piece of music."<ref name="BBCreview">"More of the Night He Came Home", review of ''Halloween II'', ''BBC Collective'', October 23, 2003, at [http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A1910459 BBC.co.uk]; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref> Carpenter performed the score with the assistance of Alan Howarth, who had previously been involved in ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' (1979) and would work again with Carpenter on projects such as ''[[Escape from New York]]'' (1981), ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' (1982) and ''[[Christine (1983 film)|Christine]]'' (1983).<ref>{{IMDb name|id=0397697|name=Alan Howarth}}; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref>

The film featured the song "[[Mr. Sandman]]" performed by [[The Chordettes]]. "[[Mr. Sandman]]" which would later be featured in the opening scenes of [[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]].
<ref>Soundtrack, ''Halloween II'', at [http://www.halloweenmovies.com/filmarchive/h2soundtrack.htm HalloweenMovies.com]; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref> Reviewers commented on the decision to include this song in the film, calling the selection "interesting" and "not a song you would associate with a film like this."  The song worked well to "mimic Laurie's situation (sleeping a lot), [making] the once innocent sounding lyrics seem threatening in a horror film."<ref name="BBCreview"/> Another critic saw the inclusion of the song as "inappropriate" and asked, "What was ''that'' about?"<ref>Review of ''Halloween II'',

==Release==
To advertise ''Halloween II'', Universal printed a poster that featured a skull superimposed onto a pumpkin. This imagery is described by film historian and sociologist Robert E. Kapsis as "an unmistakable horror motif." Kapsis points out that by 1981 horror had "become a ''genre non grata''" with critics. The effect of this can be seen in the distributor's promotion of the film as horror while at the same time stressing that the sequel, like its predecessor, "was more a quality suspense film than a 'slice and dice' horror film."<ref>Kapsis, ''Hitchcock'', p. 171.</ref> Use of the tagline ''More Of The Night HE Came Home''<U+2014>a modified version of the original ''Halloween'' tagline<U+2014>hoped to accomplish the same task.

===Novelization===
[[Halloween (novel)|An adaptation]] of the screenplay was printed as a [[mass market paperback]] in 1981 by horror and science-fiction writer [[Dennis Etchison]] under the pseudonym Jack Martin.  Etchison's novelization was distributed by Kensington Books and became a bestseller. It also features captioned black and white stills from the film at the beginning of each chapter.<ref>Jack Martin, ''Halloween II'' (New York: Kensington, 1981), ISBN 0-89083-864-X.</ref><ref>Dennis Etchison, Jack Dann, and Ramsey Campbell, eds., ''Gathering the Bones: Original Stories from the World's Masters of Horror'' (New York: Tor/Forge, 2003), p. 447, ISBN 0-7653-0179-2.</ref>

===Television===
An alternate version of ''Halloween II'' (sometimes referred to as 'The Producer's Cut') has been airing on network television since the early 1980s (most recently on [[AMC (TV network)|AMC]]), with most of the graphic violence and gore edited out and many minor additional scenes added, some others removed. The length of the film still runs nearly identical to the theatrical version.  There are many edits such as the murders of Alice, Dr. Mixter, Janet, and Mrs. Alves - all presumed to still happen, but some are off camera.  Jimmy's discovery of Mrs. Alves dead and his subsequent slipping in the pool of blood has been significantly shortened and moved to the VERY end of the film, happening right at the explosion which kills Myers. Also added are scenes of Michael cutting the power (this explains the dark setting throughout the latter half of the film) and a power generator kicking in. There is also extra dialogue between Laurie and Jimmy, Laurie and Mrs. Alves, Janet and Karen, Karen and Mr. Garrett, Bud and Karen, Jill and Jimmy, etc.  Another notable difference is the killing of the Marshall. In the theatrical version his throat is slit, while in the TV version it is softened, with Michael grabbing him and stabbing him from behind (not viewed by audience). While the theatrical version ends with the presumed deaths of Michael Myers and Dr. Loomis and leaves the audience in a gray area as to whether Jimmy survives, the television cut features an alternative ending showing Jimmy alive (with bandaged head wound from his slip) in the ambulance with Laurie Strode. They hold hands and Laurie says, "We made it."<ref name="distribution"/>

===Home video release===
''Halloween II'' was first released on VHS and laserdisc in 1982 by [[MCA/Universal Home Video]] and later by Goodtimes Home Video. From 1998, DVD editions have also been released by these companies.<ref name="distribution">[http://www.halloweenmovies.com/filmarchive/h2distribution.htm Halloween<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Shout! Factory]] plans to re-release the film to a collector's edition DVD on September 18, 2012 with new special features.<ref>http://www.shoutfactorystore.com/prod.aspx?pfid=5257866&sid=3242E92E8990482F9C7068BCEB7557DE&nocookie=true</ref>

In 2007, the film was released as a two-disc "Universal double feature" with ''[[Halloween III: Season of the Witch]]''. Lions Gate re-released the film on DVD in Australia in 2008 and it contains no special features.<ref name="BBFC">[http://www.bbfc.co.uk/FVF035200 Halloween II DVD<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

====Blu-ray release====
[[Universal Studios Home Entertainment|Universal Studios]] released the film on [[Blu-ray]] in the United States on September 13, 2011. It is packaged as a 30th Anniversary Edition and includes deleted scenes, My Scenes featurette, Pocket BLU app, an alternate ending and the 1984 documentary feature ''[[Terror in the Aisles]]''.

The release sparked controversy immediately due to the fact that Universal removed the credit "[[Moustapha Akkad]] Presents" and replaced it with "Universal, An MCA Company, Presents" ... in a font that does not match the rest of the opening credits. Akkad's son, Malek, called the stunt "''disgusting. It's a disgrace[;] obviously, bias[.] [O]bjectively, any horror fan would find this as an insult to the man who has done so much to the series. And to come after his [[2005 Amman bombings|tragic death]], he's not even around to defend himself. It's classless. I'm talking to Universal now and they're 'looking into it.'''" However, Akkad was still credited on the packaging. Fans immediately called for a boycott of the disc and set up a [[Facebook]] page.<ref>[http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=20993 Halloween II: How Universal direspected Moustapha Akkad] - Shock Till You Drop.com, September 14, 2011</ref> On November 28, Universal started sending out emails announcing that the revised Blu-ray was now available and for owners of the previous disc to provide the studio with their "address and daytime phone number."<ref>[http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/49027/halloween-ii-blu-ray-justice-has-been-served Halloween II Blu-ray: Justice has been served] - Dread Central.com, November 28, 2011</ref>

[[Shout! Factory]] re-released the film to a Collector's Edition Blu-ray (and DVD) on September 18, 2012 under its new Scream Factory label with new special features, including two new audio commentaries, two new "behind-the-scenes" featurettes, deleted scenes, an alternate ending, the theatrical trailer, TV and radio spots, and still gallery. <ref>http://www.shoutfactorystore.com/prod.aspx?pfid=5257867</ref> It was announced on the Scream Factory Facebook page that the Collector's Edition contains the TV Cut, along with a downloadable script of the film, on a second DVD disc for both format releases. An advance Blu-ray.com review confirmed that the new Blu-ray release restores the Akkad credit.

====Replica masks====
In January 2012, Trick or Treat Studios<ref>http://www.trickortreatstudios.com</ref> announced the release of two Officially Licensed Halloween II masks from Universal Studios. The first mask is a replica of how the mask looked throughout the majority of the film and other is a replica of how the mask looked during the final scene of the movie after The Shape was shot in the eyes, called Blood Tears.  Both masks will be available for sale in costume stores starting Halloween 2012.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Critical reaction to the film was negative to mixed. It has a 30% "rotten" rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. While film critics had largely showered praise on ''Halloween'', most reviews of its sequel compared it with the original and found it wanting. Roger Ebert of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' wrote that ''Halloween II'' represented "a fall from greatness"  that "doesn't even attempt to do justice to the original."  He also commented, "Instead, it tries to outdo all the other violent ''Halloween'' rip-offs of the last several years."<ref name="Ebertreview"/> Web based critic [[James Berardinelli]] offered a particularly stinging review:<blockquote>''The main problem is the film's underlying motivation. Halloween was a labor of love, made by people committed to creating the most suspenseful and compelling motion picture they could. Halloween II was impelled by the desire to make money. It was a postscript<U+2014>and not a very good one<U+2014>slapped together because a box office success was guaranteed.''<ref name="Berardinellireview"/></blockquote> He accused Carpenter and Hill of not believing "in this project the way they believed in the original, and it shows in the final product. The creepiness of the first movie has been replaced by a growing sense of repetitive boredom." Berardinelli was not impressed by the decision to give Myers so much screen time. He says, "The Shape, who was an ominous and forbidding force, has been turned into a plodding zombie. The characters have all been lobotomized, and, in keeping with the slasher trend, the gore content is way up. There was virtually no blood in Halloween; Halloween II cheerfully heaps it on."<ref name="Berardinellireview"/>

However, especially more in recent years, critics have taken a more positive stance towards  the film, stating that it was far better than the slew of inferior sequels and rip-offs that followed in subsequent years. [[Janet Maslin]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' compared the film to other horror sequels and recently released slasher films of the early 1980s rather than to the original. "By the standards of most recent horror films, this<U+2014>like its predecessor<U+2014>is a class act." She notes that there "is some variety to the crimes, as there is to the characters, and an audience is more likely to do more screaming at suspenseful moments than at scary ones." Maslin applauded the performance of the cast and Rosenthal and concluded, "That may not be much to ask of a horror film, but it's more than many of them offer."<ref>Janet Maslin, "Movie: 'Halloween II' for Fright Fans", New York ''Times'', October 30, 1981, p. C8.</ref> [[David Pirie]]'s review in ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' magazine gave Rosenthal's film positive marks, stating, "Rosenthal is no Carpenter, but he makes a fair job of emulating the latter's visual style in this sequel." He wrote that the Myers character had evolved since the first film to become "an agent of Absolute Evil."<ref>David Pirie, review of ''Halloween II'', ''Time Out'' magazine, reprinted in 1991, p. 277.</ref> Film historian Jim Harper suggests, "Time has been a little fairer to the film" than original critics. In retrospect, "many critics have come to recognise that it's considerably better than the slew of imitation slashers that swamped the genre in the eighties."<ref>Jim Harper, ''Legacy of Blood: A Comprehensive Guide to Slasher Movies'' (Manchester, Eng.: HeadPress/Critical Vision, 2004), pp. 16<U+2013>17, ISBN 1-900486-39-3.</ref>

Like the original ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', this and other slasher films have come under fire from feminist critics. According to historian Nicholas Rogers, academic critics "have seen the slasher movies since ''Halloween'' as debasing women in as decisive a manner as hardcore pornography."<ref name="Rogers" /> Critics such as John Kenneth Muir point out that female characters such as Laurie Strode survive not because of "any good planning" or their own resourcefulness, but sheer luck. Although she manages to repel the killer several times, in the end, Strode is rescued in ''Halloween'' only when Dr. Loomis arrives to shoot Myers.<ref>John Kenneth Muir, ''Wes Craven: The Art of Horror'' (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland & Company, 1998), p. 104, ISBN 0-7864-1923-7.</ref>

In 1982, the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, USA, nominated the film for two [[Saturn Awards]]: Best Horror Film and Best Actor for Pleasence. The film lost to ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' (1981) and [[Harrison Ford]] was chosen over Pleasence for his role in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981).<ref>Saturn Awards, 1982, at the [http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Academy_of_Science_Fiction_Fantasy_And_Horror_Films_USA/1982 Internet Movie Database]; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref>

===Controversy===
A tragic incident with minor connections to the film heightened attitudes about the potent effects of media violence on young people. On December 7, 1982, Richard Delmer Boyer of [[El Monte, California]], murdered Francis and Eileen Harbitz, an elderly couple in Fullerton, California, leading to the trial ''People v. Boyer'' (1989). The couple were stabbed 43 times by Boyer. According to the trial transcript, Boyer's defense was that he suffered from [[hallucination]]s in the Harbitz residence brought on by "the movie ''Halloween II'', which defendant had seen under the influence of [[Phencyclidine|PCP]], marijuana, and alcohol." The film was played for the jury, and a psychopharmacologist "pointed out various similarities between its scenes and the visions defendant described."<ref>''People v. Boyer'' (1989) 48 C3d 247, transcript available [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/48C3d247.htm here]; last accessed April 19, 2006.</ref>
Boyer was found guilty and sentenced to death. The incident became known as the "''Halloween II'' Murders" and was featured in a short segment on [[Turner Network Television|TNT]]'s ''Monstervision'', hosted by film critic [[Joe Bob Briggs]].<ref name="behindthescenes"/> Following the trial, moral critics came to the defense of horror films and rejected calls to ban them. Thomas M. Sipos, for instance, stated,<blockquote>''It would be silly, after all, to ban horror films just because Boyer claims to have thought that he was reenacting Halloween II, or to ban cars because Texas housewife Clara Harris intentionally ran down and killed her husband. Nor does it make sense to ban otherwise useful items such as drugs or guns just because some individuals misuse them.''<ref>Thomas M. Sipos, "Don't Blame the Devil This Halloween", October 11, 2005, at [http://www.hollywoodinvestigator.com/pork/boyer.htm HollywoodInvestigator.com]; last accessed April 19, 2006.
