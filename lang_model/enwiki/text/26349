'''Self-help groups for mental health''' are voluntary associations of people who share a common desire to overcome [[mental illness]] or otherwise increase their level of cognitive or emotional wellbeing.<ref name="HUMPHREYS1994">{{cite journal | last = Humphreys | first = Keith | coauthors = Rappaport, Julian | title = Researching self-help/mutual aid groups and organizations: Many roads, on journey | year = 1994 | month = Autumn | journal = Applied and Preventative Psychology |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=217<U+2013>231 |doi=10.1016/S0962-1849(05)80096-4}}</ref> There are several international mental health self-help organizations including [[Emotions Anonymous]], the [[Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance]] (DBSA), [[GROW]], and [[Recovery International]].

== Classification ==
Self-help groups for mental health provide mutual support and [[peer support]]. Mutual support is a process by which people voluntarily come together to help each other address common problems. Peer support is social, emotional or instrumental support that is mutually offered or provided by persons with similar [[mental health]] conditions where there is some mutual agreement on what is helpful.<ref name="SOLOMON2004"/><ref name="DAVIDSON1999">{{cite journal | last = Davidson | first = Larry | coauthors = Chinman, Matthew; Kloos, Bret; Weingarten, Richard; Stayner, David; Kraemer, Jacob; | year = 1999 | title = Peer Support Among Individuals with Severe Mental Illness: A Review of the Evidence | journal = Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 165<U+2013>187 | issn = 1468-2850 | doi = 10.1093/clipsy/6.2.165}}</ref>

The definitions of mutual support and peer support include many other [[mental health consumer]] [[non-profit]]s and social groups. Such groups are further distinguished as either Individual Therapy (inner-focused) or Social Reform (outer-focused) groups. In the former set members seek to improve themselves, wheres the latter set encompasses advocacy organizations such as [[Mental Health America]], NAMI [http://www.nami.org www.nami.org] and [[United States Psychiatric Rehabilitation Association|USPRA]].<ref name="NANCY2006">{{cite journal | last = Tomes | first = Nancy | year = 2006 | month = May | title = The Patient As A Policy Factor: A Historical Case Study Of The Consumer/Survivor Movement In Mental Health | journal = Health affairs (Project Hope) | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 720<U+2013>729 | issn = 1544-5208 | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.25.3.720 | pmid = 16684736}}</ref> Self-help groups include Family-to-Family education and support groups, a program of NAMI. The effectiveness of this program has been confirmed in a recent controlled study.<ref>Dixon, L. B., Lucksted, A., Medoff, D. R., Burland, J., Stewart, B., Lehman, A. F., Fang, L. J., Sturm, V., Brown, C., Murray-Swank, A. (2011). Outcomes of a randomized study of a peer-taught family-to-family education program for mental illness. Psychiatric Services, 62(6), 591-598.</ref> In recent years, culturally adapted versions of the Family to Family program have begun to spread to lower income countries, for example, in El Salvador (www.ACISAM.org, in collaboration with the U.S. based Center for Health and Human Development), Mexico, and Malaysia. 

Since the advent of the internet, online self help and support groups have been another option for those seeking peer support. The forums, chat rooms, and public profiles provide instant contact with others no matter what time it is or where they are. Many websites allow for anonymity so those who have felt stigmatized by their illnesses can feel free to open up and seek support without the constraints of sharing their actual identity. While anonymity provides a safe environment, the communities and strong bonds that develop on these sites can act as a simultaneous social outlet and self help site for many sufferers. On these sites people seek comfort, affirmations, support, ways to cope, and information on various methods and medications to facilitate future treatment. 

[[Self-help]] groups are subsets of mutual support and peer support groups, and have a specific purpose for mutual aid in satisfying a common need, overcoming a shared handicap or life-disrupting problem. Self-help groups are less bureaucratic and work on a more [[grassroots]] level.<ref name="SOLOMON2004"/><ref name="MOELLER1999"/><ref name="LEVY1978">{{cite journal | last = Levy | first = Leon H. | year = 1978 | title = Self-help groups viewed by mental health professionals: A survey and comments | journal = American Journal of Community Psychology | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 305<U+2013>313 | issn = 0091-0562 | doi = 10.1007/BF00885522 | pmid = 696694}}</ref> Self-help Organizations are national affiliates of local self-help groups or mental health consumer groups that finance research, maintain public relations or lobby for legislation in favor of those affected.<ref name="MOELLER1999"/>

=== Behavior Control and Stress Coping groups ===
Of Individual Therapy groups, researchers distinguish between Behavior Control groups (such as [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] and [[TOPS Club, Inc.|TOPS]]) and Stress Coping groups (such as mental health support groups, [[Cancer support group|cancer patient support groups]], and groups of [[single parents]]).<ref name="KNIGHT1980"/> German researchers refer to Stress Coping groups as Conversation Circles.<ref name="MOELLER1999">{{cite journal | last = Moeller | first = Michael L. | title = History, Concept and Position of Self-Help Groups in Germany | journal = Group Analysis | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 181<U+2013>194 | year = 1999 | doi = 10.1177/05333169922076653 | issn = 0533-3164}}</ref>

Significant differences exist between Behavioral Control groups and Stress Coping groups. Meetings of Behavior Control groups tend to be significantly larger than Stress Coping counterparts (by more than a factor of two). Behavior Control group members have a longer average group tenure than members of Stress Coping groups (45 months compared to 11 months), and are less likely to consider their membership as temporary. While very few members of either set saw professionals concurrently while being active in their group, Stress Coping members were more likely to have previously seen professionals than Behavior Control group members. Similarly, Stress Coping groups worked closer with mental health professionals.<ref name="KNIGHT1980"/><ref name="WOLLERT1982">{{cite journal | last = Wollert | first = Richard W. | coauthors = Levy, Leon H.; Knight, Bob G. | year = 1982 | month = May | title = Help-Giving in Behavioral Control and Stress Coping Self-Help Groups | journal = Small Group Research | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 204<U+2013>218 | issn = 1046-4964 | doi = 10.1177/104649648201300206}}</ref>

=== Talking Groups ===
In Germany a specific subset of Conversation Circles are categorized as Talking Groups (''Gespr<U+00E4>chsselbsthilfegruppen''). In Talking Groups all members of the group have the same rights, each member is responsible only for themselves (group members do not make decisions for other group members), each group is autonomous, everyone attends the group on account of their own problems, whatever is discussed in the group remains confidential, and participation is free of charge.<ref name="MOELLER1999"/>

=== Affiliation and lifespan ===
If self-help groups are not affiliated with a national organization, professional involvement increases their [[life expectancy]]. Conversely, if particular groups are affiliated with a national organization professional involvement decreases their life expectancy.<ref name="MATON1989">{{cite journal | last = Maton | first = Kenneth I. | coauthors = Leventhal, Gerald S.; Madara, Edward J.; Julien, Mariesa | year = 1989 | month = October | title = Factors affecting the birth and death of mutual-help groups: The role of national affiliation, professional involvement, and member focal problem | journal = American Journal of Community Psychology | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 643<U+2013>671 | issn = 0091-0562 | doi = 10.1007/BF00922640 | pmid = 2627026}}</ref> Rules enforcing self-regulation in Talking Groups are essential for the group's effectiveness.<ref name="MOELLER1999"/>

== Comparison ==
=== Emotions Anonymous ===
{{Main|Emotions Anonymous}}
Emotions Anonymous (EA) is a twelve-step program similar to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), but for the purpose of helping its members recover from [[Clinical depression|depression]] and other mental illnesses. EA is the largest of three organizations that have adapted AA's Twelve Steps to create a program for people suffering from mental or emotional illness, replacing the word "alcohol" with "our emotions" in the First Step. Smaller organizations include [[Neurotics Anonymous]] (N/A or NAIL) and [[Emotional Health Anonymous]] (EHA). EA is a successor organization of Neurotics Anonymous.

EA and NAIL are open to anyone who desires to become emotionally well,<ref name="BOYDSTONINTRO1974">{{cite thesis |last=Boydston |first=Grover |title=A history and status report of Neurotics Anonymous, an organization offering self-help for the mentally and emotionally disturbed |year=1974 |publisher=[[Barry University]] |location=[[Miami, Florida]] |oclc=14126024 |pages=1<U+2013>5 |chapter=Part I.

=== GROW ===
{{Main|GROW}}
GROW was founded in [[Sydney, Australia]], in 1957 by a [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]], [[Con Keogh|Father Cornelius Keogh]], and people who had sought help with their mental illness at Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. After its inception, GROW members learned of Recovery, Inc. (the organization now known as Recovery International) and integrated its processes into their program. GROW's original literature includes the Twelve Stages of Decline, which state that emotional illness begins with self-centeredness, and the Twelve Steps of Recovery and Personal Growth, a blend of AA's Twelve Steps and will-training methods from Recovery International. GROW groups are open to anyone who would like to join, though they specifically recruit people who have been in psychiatric hospitals or are socioeconomically disadvantaged. GROW does not operate with funding restrictions and have received state and outside funding in the past.<ref name="KURTZ1987">{{cite journal | last = Kurtz | first = Linda F. | coauthors = Chambon, Adrienne | year = 1987 | title = Comparison of self-help groups for mental health | journal = Health & social work | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 275<U+2013>283 | issn = 0360-7283 | pmid = 3679015}}</ref>

=== Recovery International ===
{{Main|Recovery International}}
Recovery, Inc. was founded in [[Chicago, Illinois]] in 1937 by psychiatrist [[Abraham Low]] using principles in contrast to those popularized by [[psychoanalysis]].<ref name="SAGARINMENTAL1969"/> During the organization's annual meeting in June 2007 it was announced that Recovery, Inc. would thereafter be known as Recovery International.<ref name="REPORTER2007">{{cite journal |journal=Recovery Reporter |title=Annual Meeting |year=2007 |month=2nd Quarter |volume=70 |issue=2 |oclc=22518904 |publisher=Recovery, Inc |location=Chicago, Illinois}}</ref> Recovery International is open to anyone identifying as "nervous" (a compromise between the loaded term [[neurosis|neurotic]] and the colloquial phrase "nervous breakdown");<ref name="SAGARINMENTAL1969"/> strictly encourages members to follow their physician's, social worker's, psychologist's or psychiatrist's orders; and does not operate with funding restrictions.<ref name="KURTZ1987"/>

Fundamentally, Low believes "Adult life is not driven by [[instincts]] but guided by [[Will (philosophy)|Will]]," using a definition of will opposite of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Arthur Schopenhauer's]]. Low's program is based on increasing determination to act, [[Self control|self-control]] and [[self-esteem|self-confidence]]. [[Edward Sagarin]] compared it to a modern, reasonable, and rational implementation of [[<U+00C9>mile Cou<U+00E9>|<U+00C9>mile Cou<U+00E9>'s]] psychotherapy.<ref name="SAGARINMENTAL1969">{{cite book |last=Sagarin |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Sagarin |title=Odd Man In: Societies of Deviants in America |year=1969 |publisher=Quadrangle Books |location=[[Chicago, Illinois]] |isbn=0-531-06344-5 |oclc=34435 |pages=210<U+2013>232 |chapter=Chapter 9.

=== Professionally led group psychotherapy ===
{{Main|Group therapy}}
Self-help groups are not intended to provide "deep" psychotherapy. Nevertheless, their emphasis on psychosocial processes, and the understanding shared by those with the same or similar mental illnesses does achieve constructive treatment goals.<ref name="DEAN1971"/>

Interpersonal learning, which is done through processes such as feedback and confrontation, is generally deemphasized in self-help groups. This is largely because it can be threatening, and requires training and understanding of small group processes. Similarly, reality testing, is also deemphasized. Reality testing relies on consensual [[Compliance (Psychology)|validation]], offering feedback, seeking feedback and confrontation. These processes seldom occur in self-help groups, though they frequently occur in professionally directed groups.<ref name="DAVIDSON1999">{{cite journal | last = Davidson | first = Larry | coauthors = Chinman, Matthew; Kloos, Bret; Weingarten, Richard; Stayner, David; Kraemer, Jacob; | year = 1999 | title = Peer Support Among Individuals with Severe Mental Illness: A Review of the Evidence | journal = Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 165<U+2013>187 | issn = 1468-2850 | doi = 10.1093/clipsy.6.2.165}}</ref><ref name="WOLLERT1982"/>

== Group processes ==
No two self-help group are exactly alike, the make-up and attitudes are influenced by the group ideology and environment.<ref name="DAVIDSON1999"/> In most cases, the group becomes a miniature society that can function like a buffer between the members and the rest of the world.<ref name="DEAN1971"/> The most essential processes are those that meet personal and social needs in an environment of [[safety]] and [[simplicity]]. Elegant theoretical formulations, systematic behavioral techniques, and complicated [[Cognitive restructuring|cognitive-restructuring]] methods are not necessary.<ref name="WOLLERT1982"/>

Despite the differences, researchers have identified many psychosocial processes occurring in self-help groups related to their effectiveness. This list includes, but is not limited too: [[acceptance]], [[Practice (learning method)|behavioral rehearsal]], changing member's [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspectives]] of themselves, changing member's perspectives of the world, [[catharsis]], [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]], [[role model]]ing, learning new [[coping strategies]], mutual [[wikt:affirmation|affirmation]], [[Objective (goal)|personal goal setting]], instilling [[hope]], [[Theory of justification|justification]], [[Normalization (sociology)|normalization]], positive [[reinforcement]], reducing [[social isolation]], reducing [[Stigma (sociological theory)|stigma]], [[self-disclosure]], sharing (or "opening up"), and showing [[empathy]].<ref name="SOLOMON2004"/><ref name="DAVIDSON1999"/><ref name="MOELLER1999"/><ref name="WOLLERT1982"/><ref name="DEAN1971"/><ref name="POWELL2000"/><ref name="SARGENT2002">{{cite journal | last = Sargent | first = Judy | coauthors = Williams, Reg A.; Hagerty, Bonnie; Lynch-Sauer, Judith; Hoyle, Kenneth | year = 2002 | title = Sense of Belonging as a Buffer Against Depressive Symptoms | journal = Journal of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 120<U+2013>129 | issn = 1532-5725 | doi = 10.1067/mpn.2002.127290}}</ref>

Five theoretical frameworks have been used in attempts to explain the effectiveness of self-help groups.<ref name="SOLOMON2004"/>
# [[Social support]]: Having a community of people to give physical and emotional comfort, people who love and care, is a [[Moderator variable|moderating factor]] in the development of psychological and physical disease.
# [[Experiential knowledge]]: Members obtain specialized information and perspectives that other members have obtained through living with severe mental illness. Validation of their approaches to problems increase their confidence.
# [[Social learning theory]]: Members with experience become creditable role models.
# [[Social comparison theory]]: Individuals with similar mental illness are attracted to each other in order to establish a sense of normalcy for themselves. Comparing one another to each other is considered to provide other peers with an incentive to change for the better either through upward comparison (looking up to someone as a role model) or downward comparison (seeing an example of how debilitating mental illness can be).
# [[Helper theory]]: Those helping each other feel greater interpersonal competence from changing other's lives for the better. The helpers feel they have gained as much as they have given to others. The helpers receive "personalized learning" from working with helpees. The helpers' self-esteem improves with the social approval received from those they have helped, putting them an a more advantageous position to help others.

A framework derived from common themes in empirical data describes recovery as a contextual nonlinear process, a trend of general improvement with unavoidable [[wiktionary:paroxysm|paroxysm]]s while negotiating environmental, socioeconomic and internal forces, motivated by a drive to move forward in one's life. The framework identified several negotiation strategies, some designed to accommodate illnesses and others designed to change thinking and behavior. The former category includes strategies such as acceptance and [[Balance (metaphysics)|balancing]] activities. The latter includes [[Positive mental attitude|positive thinking]], increasing one's own personal [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]]/[[Control theory (sociology)|control]] and [[Psychiatric survivors movement|activism within the mental health system]].<ref name="OCHOCKA2005">{{cite journal |last=Ochocka |first=Joanna |coauthors=Nelson, Geoff; Janzen, Rich |title=Moving Forward: Negotiating Self and External Circumstances in Recovery |pmid=15895914 |journal=Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal |volume=28 |issue=4 |month=Spring |year=2005 |pages=315<U+2013>322 |doi=10.2975/28.2005.315.322}}</ref>

== Relationship with mental health professionals ==
A 1978 survey of [[mental health professional]]s in the United States found they had a relatively favorable opinion of self-help groups and there was a hospitable climate for integration and cooperation with self-help groups in the mental health delivery system.<ref name="LEVY1978" /> The role of self-help groups in instilling hope, facilitating coping, and improving the quality of life of their members is now widely accepted in many areas both inside and outside of the general medical community.<ref name="DAVIDSON1999"/>

A survey of psychotherapists in [[Germany]] found that 50% of the respondents reported a high or very high acceptance of self-help groups and 43.2% rated their acceptance of self-help groups as moderate. Only 6.8% of respondents rated their acceptance of self-help groups as low or very low.<ref name="FRIEDHELM2004">{{cite journal | last = Friedhelm | first = Meyer | coauthors = Matzat, J<U+00FC>rgen; H<U+00F6>flich, Anke; Scholz, Sigrid; Beutel, Manfred E. | year = 2004 | month = December | title = Self-help groups for psychiatric and psychosomatic disorders in Germany<U+2014>themes, frequency and support by self-help advice centres | journal = Journal of Public Health | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 359<U+2013>364 | issn = 0943-1853 | doi = 10.1007/s10389-004-0071-0}}</ref>

Surveys of self-help groups has shown very little evidence of antagonism towards mental health professionals.<ref name="KURTZ1987"/> The maxim of self-help groups in the United States is "Doctors know better than we do how a sickness can be treated. We know better than doctors how sick people can be treated as humans."<ref name="MOELLER1999"/>

Professional referrals to self-help groups for mental health are less effective than arranging for prospective self-help members to meet with veterans of the self-help group. This is true even when compared to referrals from professionals familiar with the self-help group when referring clients to it.<ref name="POWELL2000"/> Referrals mostly come from informal sources (e.g. family, friends, word of mouth, self). Those attending groups as a result of professional referrals account for only one fifth to one third of the population.<ref name="DAVIDSON1999"/> One survey found 54% of members learned about their self-help group from the media, 40% learned about the their group from friends and relatives, and relatively few learned about them from professional referrals.<ref name="KNIGHT1980"/>

== Criticism ==
There are several limitations of self-help groups for mental health, including but not limited to their inability to keep detailed records, lack of formal procedures to follow-up with members, absence of formal screening procedures for new members, lack formal leadership training, and likely inability of members to recognize a "newcomer" presenting with a serious illness requiring immediate treatment. Additionally, there is a lack of professional or legal regulatory constraints determining how such groups can operate, there is a danger that members may disregard the advice of mental health professionals, and there can be an anti-therapeutic suppression of ambivalence and hostility.<ref name="KURTZ1987"/><ref name="DEAN1971"/> Researchers have also elaborated specific criticisms regarding self-help groups' formulaic approach, attrition rates, over-generalization, and "panacea complex".

Researchers have questioned whether formulaic approaches to self-help [[group therapy]], like the [[Twelve-step program#Twelve Steps|Twelve Steps]], could stifle creativity or if adherence to them may prevent the group from making useful or necessary changes.<ref name="DEAN1971">{{cite journal | last = Dean | first = Stanley R. | year = 1971 | month = January | title = The Role of Self-Conducted Group Therapy | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 127 | issue = 7 | pages = 934<U+2013>937 | issn = 0002-953X | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.127.7.934 | doi_brokendate = 2008-06-25 | pmid = 5540340}}</ref><ref name="SAGARINGAMBLERS1969">{{cite book |last=Sagarin |first=Edward |title=Odd man in; societies of deviants in America |year=1969 |publisher=Quadrangle Books |location=[[Chicago, Illinois]] |isbn=0-531-06344-5 |oclc=34435 |pages=56<U+2013>77 |chapter=Chapter 3.

There is not a universal appeal of self-help groups; as few as 17% of people invited to attend a self-help group will do so. Of those, only one third will stay for longer than four months. Those who continue are people who value the meetings and the self-help group experience.<ref name="KURTZ1987"/><ref name="DAVIDSON1999"/><ref name="DEAN1971"/>

Since these groups are not specifically diagnosis-related, but rather for anyone seeking mental and emotional health, they may not provide the necessary sense of community to evoke feelings of oneness required for recovery in self-help groups.<ref name="POWELL2000" /> [[Referent power]] is only one factor contributing to group effectiveness. A study of [[Schizophrenics Anonymous]] found [[Power (sociology)#Five bases of power|expert power]] to be more influential in measurements of perceived group helpfulness.<ref name="SALEM2000">{{cite journal |last=Salem |first=Deborah |coauthors=Reischl, Thomas M.; Gallacher, Fiona; Randall, Katie Weaver |title=Referent and Expert Power in Mutual Help |journal=American Journal of Community Psychology |issn=1573-2770 |volume=28 |month=June |year=2000 |pages=303<U+2013>324 |doi=10.1023/A:1005101320639 |issue=3 |pmid=10945119}}</ref>

There is a risk that self-help group members may come to believe that group participation is a [[Panacea (medicine)|panacea]]<U+2014>that the group's processes can remedy any problem.<ref name="DAVIDSON1999"/><ref name="DEAN1971"/>
