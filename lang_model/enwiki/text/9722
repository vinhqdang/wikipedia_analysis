The '''<U+00C9>cole Polytechnique Massacre''', also known as the '''Montreal Massacre''', occurred on [[December 6]], [[1989]] at the [[<U+00C9>cole Polytechnique de Montr<U+00E9>al|<U+00C9>cole Polytechnique]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]. Twenty-five year-old [[Marc L<U+00E9>pine]], armed with a legally obtained [[semi-automatic rifle]] and a [[hunting knife]],  shot twenty-eight people, killing fourteen (all of them women) and injuring the other fourteen before killing himself. He began his attack by entering a classroom at the university, where he separated the male and female students. After claiming that he was "fighting [[feminism]]", he shot all nine women in the room, killing six. He then moved through corridors, the cafeteria, and another classroom, specifically targetting women to shoot. He killed fourteen women and injured four men and ten women in just under twenty minutes before turning the gun on himself.<!-- Most websources including media reports say 13, but a careful check of the coroner's report indicates that there were 14 wounded: one arrived at hospital by foot and was presumably only mildly injured, therefore probably did not get onto the list of wounded referenced here.

L<U+00E9>pine was the child of a [[French Canadian|French-Canadian]] mother and an [[Algeria]]n father, and had been physically abused by his father during his childhood.  His suicide note claimed political motives and blamed feminists for ruining his life. The note included a list of nineteen Quebec women whom L<U+00E9>pine considered to be feminists and apparently wished to kill.<ref name="Chun">{{cite journal| last =Chun| first =Wendy Hui Kyong| title =Unbearable Witness: towards a Politics of Listening | journal =Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies | volume =11| issue =1| pages =112<U+2013>149| date =1999}}</ref>  

Since the attack, Canadians have debated various interpretations of the events, their significance, and L<U+00E9>pine's motives. Many feminist groups and public officials have characterized the massacre as an anti-feminist attack that is representative of wider societal violence against women.<ref name =kay/><ref name="Eglin"/><ref name = "Day">{{cite news | last =Fitzpatrick| first =Meagan| title =National day of remembrance pays tribute to victims of Montreal massacre| publisher =CanWest News Service| date = [[December 6]] [[2006]] | url =http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=dcb98c06-2c4f-46f1-bc6f-6a147308a252&k=33060| accessdate = 2006-12-27}}</ref> Consequently, the anniversary of the massacre has since been commemorated as the [[National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women]].

==Massacre==
Sometime after 4&nbsp;p.m. on [[December 6]], [[1989]], Marc L<U+00E9>pine arrived at the <U+00C9>cole Polytechnique building, an engineering school affiliated with the [[Universit<U+00E9> de Montr<U+00E9>al]], armed with a [[semi-automatic rifle]] and a [[hunting knife]].<ref name="coroner"/> He had purchased the [[Sturm, Ruger]] brand rifle, [[Mini-14]] model, on [[November 21]], [[1989]] in a Montreal hunting store, telling the clerk that he was going to use it to hunt small game.<ref>{{cite news|last =Weston| first =Greg| title =Why?

[[Image:Exterior of Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal.jpg|thumb|left|Exterior of <U+00C9>cole Polytechnique de Montr<U+00E9>al]]

L<U+00E9>pine sat for a time in the office of the registrar on the second floor. He was seen rummaging through a plastic bag and did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member asked if she could help him. He left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10&nbsp;p.m.<ref name="coroner"/> After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling.<ref>{{cite web| title =Gunman massacres 14 women| work =Archives| publisher =CBC| date = [[6 December]] [[1989]]| url =http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-70-398-2235/disasters_tragedies/montreal_massacre/clip1| format =video stream| accessdate = 2006-12-29}}</ref> 

L<U+00E9>pine then separated the nine women from the approximately fifty men and ordered the men to leave.<ref name="cernea"/> Speaking in French, he asked the remaining women whether they knew why they were there, and when one student replied "no", he answered: "I am fighting feminism". One of the students, Nathalie Provost, said, "Look, we are just women studying engineering, not necessarily feminists ready to march on the streets to shout we are against men, just students intent on leading a normal life." L<U+00E9>pine responded that "You're women, you're going to be engineers. You're all a bunch of feminists. I hate feminists." He then opened fire on the students from left to right, killing six, and wounding three others, including Provost.<ref name="coroner"/><ref name="Chun"/>  Before leaving the room, he wrote the word ''shit'' twice on a student project.<ref name="cernea"/>
 
L<U+00E9>pine continued into the second floor corridor and wounded three students before entering another room where he twice attempted to shoot a female student. His weapon failed to fire so he entered the emergency staircase where he was seen reloading his gun. He returned to the room he had just left, but the students had locked the door; L<U+00E9>pine failed to unlock it with three shots fired into the door. Moving along the corridor he shot at others, wounding one, before moving towards the financial services office where he shot and killed a woman through the window of the door she had just locked.<ref name="coroner"/>

[[Image:Third floor classroom.JPG|thumb|The third floor classroom in the <U+00C9>cole Polytechnique in which the attack ended]]

He next went down to the first floor cafeteria, in which about a hundred people were gathered. The crowd scattered after he shot a woman standing near the kitchens and wounded another student. Entering an unlocked storage area at the end of the cafeteria, L<U+00E9>pine shot and killed two more women hiding there. He told a male and female student to come out from under a table; they complied and were not shot.<ref name="coroner"/>

L<U+00E9>pine then walked up an escalator to the third floor where he shot and wounded one female and two male students in the corridor. He entered another classroom and told the three students giving a presentation to "get out", shooting and wounding Maryse Leclair, who was standing on the low platform at the front of the classroom. He fired on students in the front row and then killed two women who were trying to escape the room, while other students dove under their desks. L<U+00E9>pine moved towards some of the female students, wounding three of them and killing another. He changed the magazine in his weapon and moved to the front of the class, shooting in all directions. At this point, the wounded Leclair asked for help and, after unsheathing his hunting knife, L<U+00E9>pine stabbed her three times, killing her. He took off his cap, wrapped his coat around his rifle, exclaimed "'Oh shit'", and then committed suicide by shooting himself in the head, twenty minutes after having begun his attack. About sixty bullets remained in the boxes he carried with him. He had killed fourteen women in total (twelve engineering students, one nursing student and one employee of the university) and injured fourteen <!-- NB most web and news reports state 13 wounded, but the coroner's report indicates several times that actually 14 were wounded. http://www.diarmani.com/Montreal_Coroners_Report.pdf! -->others, including four men.<ref name="coroner"/><ref name ="injured"/>

After briefing reporters outside, [[Service de police de la Ville de Montr<U+00E9>al|Montreal Police]] director of public relations Pierre Leclair entered the building and found his daughter Maryse's stabbed body.<ref name="macleans">{{cite news | last =Came| first =Barry| coauthors =Burke, D, Ferzoco, G., O'Farreli, B, Wallace, B| title = Montreal Massacre: Railing Against Feminists| publisher = Maclean's Magazine | date =[[1989-12-18]]| url= http://www.rapereliefshelter.bc.ca/dec6/macleans.html| accessdate = 2007-01-04}}</ref><ref name="funeral">{{cite news | last =Mennie| first =James| coauthors = and Bauch, Hubert| title = A quiet goodbye for slain women| pages =A1|publisher = The Gazette, Montreal | date =[[1989-12-12]]}}</ref> <br />

The massacre profoundly shocked Canadians. Government and criminal justice officials feared that extensive public discussion about the massacre would cause pain to the families and lead to antifeminist violence.<ref name="Chun"/> As a result, a public inquiry was not held<ref>{{cite news| last =Malarek| first =Victor| title =More Massacre Details to be Released by Police, but an Inquiry Ruled Out| pages =A14| publisher =Globe and Mail| date = [[12 December]] [[1989]]}}</ref> and Marc L<U+00E9>pine's suicide letter was not officially released.

The gender of Marc L<U+00E9>pine's victims as well as his oral statements during the massacre and suicide note quickly led to the event being seen as an [[Antifeminism|antifeminist]] attack and as an example of the wider issue of violence against women.<ref name="Eglin"/><ref name= Fox>{{Citation | last =  Fox| first = James Alan| last2 = Levin| first2 = Jack| author2-link = | title = Mass Murder: An Analysis of Extreme Violence| journal = Journal of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 47-64

===Police response===
Police response to the shootings was heavily criticized for the amount of time it gave L<U+00E9>pine to carry out the massacre. The first police officers to arrive at the scene established a perimeter around the building and waited before entering the building. During this period, several women were killed.<ref name="coroner"/><ref>{{cite news | last =Sheppard| first =Robert| title =A sea change in police tactics when it comes to gunmen| publisher =CBC News| date = [[September 15]] [[2006]]| url =http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/realitycheck/sheppard/20060915.html | accessdate = 2006-12-29 }}</ref>  Subsequent changes to emergency response protocols led to praise of emergency responders' handling of the [[Dawson College shooting]] in 2006 in which one woman was killed by a shooter. In that incident, coordination amongst emergency response agencies and prompt intervention was credited with minimizing the loss of life.<ref name ="Dawson"/>

===Gun control===
{{See|Gun politics in Canada}}
The massacre was a major spur for the Canadian gun control movement. One of the survivors, Heidi Rathjen, who was in one of the classrooms L<U+00E9>pine did not enter during the shooting, organized the Coalition for Gun Control with Wendy Cukier.<ref name="Dec6"/> Susan and Jim Edwards, the parents of one of the victims, were also deeply involved.<ref>{{cite news | last =Boyd| first =Denny| title =Couple salvages purpose from their daughter's tragic death|pages =B1|publisher =The Vancouver Sun| date = [[April 20]] [[1992]]}}</ref> Their activities, along with others, led to the passage of Bill C-68, or the Firearms Act, in 1995, ushering in stricter gun control regulations.<ref name="Dec6"/> These new regulations included new requirements on the training of gun owners, screening of firearm applicants, new rules concerning gun and ammunition storage and the [[Canadian gun registry|registration of all firearms]]. The gun registry in particular has been a controversial and partisan issue, with critics charging that it was a political move by the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government of [[Jean Chr<U+00E9>tien]] that has been expensive and impractical to enforce.<ref>{{cite news | last =Dixon| first =John| title =A gang that couldn't shoot straight|pages =|publisher =The Globe and Mail| date = [[January 8]] [[2003]] |url= http://www.lowe.ca/Rick/FirearmsLegislation/AGangThatCouldn'tShootStraight.html|accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref> [[Stephen Harper]]'s [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] government has extended the deadline for gun registration and has enacted legislation waiving penalties for non-compliance on the grounds that mandatory enforcement would target shooters and hunters rather than criminals. Criticism of this position and support for the registry have intensified in the wake of other [[school shooting]]s at Dawson College and [[Virginia Tech massacre|Virginia Tech]].<ref>{{cite news | last =Leslie| first =Keith| title =Ontario blasts Ottawa on gun registry|publisher =The Globe and Mail| date = [[April 18]] [[2007]] |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070418.wguns0418/BNStory/National/ |accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title =Polytechnique massacre victims remembered|publisher =CBC News| date = [[December 7]] [[2006]] |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2006/12/06/qc-montrealmassacre061206.html|accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref>

===Violence against women===
The massacre galvanized the Canadian women's movement, who see it as a symbol of [[violence against women]]. "The death of those young women would not be in vain, we promised", Canadian feminist [[Judy Rebick]] recalled. "We would turn our mourning into organizing to put an end to male violence against women."<ref>{{cite web| last =Rebick| first =Judy| title = Where's the funding for abused women?| publisher =CBC| date = [[6 December]] [[2000]]| url =http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/columns/rebick/rebick001206.html| accessdate =2007-03-07}}</ref>

In response to the killings a House of Commons Sub-Committee on the Status of Women was created. It released a report "The War against Women" in June 1991.<ref>{{cite news | last =Vienneau| first =David| title =Probe on violence toward women blocked  | pages =A4 |publisher =Toronto Star| date =[[1991-01-19]]}}</ref>  Following its recommendations, the federal government established the Canadian Panel on Violence Against Women in August 1991. The panel issued a final report, "Changing the Landscape: Ending Violence <U+2013> Achieving Equality", in June 1993. The panel proposed a two-pronged "National Action Plan" consisting of an "Equality Action Plan" and a "Zero Tolerance Policy" designed to increase women<U+2019>s equality and reduce violence against women through government policy. Critics of the panel said that the plan failed to provide a workable timeline and strategy for implementation and that with over four hundred recommendations, the final report failed to make an impact.<ref>{{cite web| last =Harder| first = Sandra | title = Violence against women: the Canadian Panel's final report | publisher = Government of Canada | url =http://dsp-psd.communication.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/MR/mr122-e.htm | accessdate = 2007-02-03 }}</ref>

==Controversy==
[[Image:Montreal massacre memorial at McMaster University.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Memorial at John Hodgins Engineering Building, [[McMaster University]]]]
The feminist movement is periodically criticized for appropriating the massacre as a symbol of male violence against women. For example, [[Charles Rackoff]], a [[University of Toronto]] [[computer science]] professor, compared those organizing vigils marking the event to the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. "The point is to use the death of these people as an excuse to promote the feminist/extreme left-wing agenda", he wrote, adding that it is "no more justified" than the KKK using the "murder of a white person by a black person as an excuse to promote their agenda."<ref>{{cite news | last = CBC news| title = Professor criticizes Montreal massacre memorials | publisher = CBC| date = [[7 December]] [[2000]] | url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2000/12/07/massacre_email001207.html| accessdate = 2007-03-07}}</ref> 

Less provocative critiques argue that L<U+00E9>pine was a "lone gunman" who does not represent men, and that violence against women is neither condoned nor encouraged officially or unofficially in western culture. In this perspective, feminist memorializing is considered socially divisive on the basis of gender and therefore harmful by bestowing guilt on all men, irrespective of individual propensity to violence against women.<ref name =kay>{{cite news | last=Kay |first=Barbara| title = Lone gunman: The Ecole Polytechnique massacre was a freak tragedy.

Men have also been subjected to criticism since the incident. Male survivors of the massacre have been condemned for not intervening to stop L<U+00E9>pine. In an interview immediately after the event, a reporter asked one of the men why they "abandoned" the women when it was clear that L<U+00E9>pine's targets were women.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lakeman|first=Lee|title= Women, Violence and the Montreal Massacre|publisher=Vancouver Rape Relief and Women<U+2019>s Shelter|url= http://www.rapereliefshelter.bc.ca/dec6/leearticle.html|accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref>   [[Ren<U+00E9> Marc Jalbert|Ren<U+00E9> Jalbert]], the [[Serjeant-at-Arms|sergeant-at-arms]] who persuaded Denis Lortie to surrender during his 1984 attack, said that someone should have intervened at least to distract L<U+00E9>pine, but acknowledged that "ordinary citizens cannot be expected to react heroically in the midst of terror."<ref name="macleans"/>    Newspaper columnist [[Mark Steyn]] suggested that the male inaction during the massacre illustrated a "culture of passivity" prevalent among men in Canada, which enabled L<U+00E9>pine<U+2019>s shooting spree: "Yet the defining image of contemporary Canadian maleness is not M Lepine/Gharbi but the professors and the men in that classroom, who, ordered to leave by the lone gunman, meekly did so, and abandoned their female classmates to their fate<U+2014>an act of abdication that would have been unthinkable in almost any other culture throughout human history."<ref>{{cite news | last=Steyn |first=Mark| title = A Culture of Passivity| publisher = National Review| date = [[18 April]] [[2007]] | url = http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YzEzYzQ0Y2MyZjNlNjY1ZTEzMTA0MGRmM2EyMTQ0NjY=| accessdate = 2007-04-20}}</ref><br />Male students and staff expressed feelings of remorse for not having attempted to prevent the shootings,<ref name="cernea"/> but Nathalie Provost, one of the survivors, said that she felt that nothing could have been done to prevent the tragedy, and that her fellow students should not feel guilty.<ref>{{cite news| last =Kastor| first =Elizabeth| title =In Montreal, A Survivor Heals After The Horror; 23-Year-Old Student Tried To Reason With Killer| publisher =The Washington Post| pages = B1|date =[[11 December]] [[1989]]}}</ref>

==Commemoration== 
Since 1991, the anniversary of the massacre has been designated the [[National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women]], intended as a call to action against discrimination against women.<ref name = "Day"/>  A [[White Ribbon Campaign]] was launched in 1991 by a group of men in [[London, Ontario]], in wake of the massacre, for the purpose of raising awareness about the prevalence of male violence against women, with the ribbon symbolizing "the idea of men giving up their arms."<ref>{{cite news| title =Men wearing white ribbons| publisher =CBC| date = [[27 November]] [[1991]]|url =http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-70-398-2240/disasters_tragedies/montreal_massacre/clip6| accessdate = 2007-03-07}}</ref> Commemorative demonstrations are held each year on [[December 6]] across the country in memory of the slain women and numerous memorials have been erected.<ref name="citynews"/>

The Place du 6-D<U+00E9>cembre-1989 (December 6,1989 Place) in the [[C<U+00F4>te-des-Neiges/Notre-Dame-de-Gr<U+00E2>ce]] borough of Montreal was created as a memorial to the victims of the massacre. Located at the corner of Decelles Avenue and Queen Mary Road, a short distance from the university, it includes the art installation ''Nef pour quatorze reines'' (''[[Nave]] for Fourteen Queens'') by Rose-Marie Goulet.<ref>{{cite news | last = CBC news| title = Monument to slain women unveiled | publisher = CBC| date =[[1999-12-05]] | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/1999/12/05/memorialsun991205.html | accessdate = 2007-01-04}}</ref> 

A memorial erected in [[Vancouver]] sparked controversy because it was dedicated to "all women murdered by men", which critics say implies all men are potential murderers.<ref>{{cite web| last =Campbell| first =Charles| title = Magnets for Memory| publisher =The Tyee| date = [[11 November]] [[2004]] | url = http://thetyee.ca/Life/2004/11/11/MagnetsforMemory/ | accessdate = 2006-12-31 }}</ref> As a result, women involved in the project received death threats and the Vancouver Park Board subsequently banned any future memorials that might "antagonize" other groups.<ref>{{cite web| last = Cooper| first =Rachelle| title = Book a Monument to Canadian Women Murdered by Men| publisher =at Guelph| date = [[19 April]] [[2006]]| url = http://www.uoguelph.ca/atguelph/06-04-19/| accessdate = 2006-12-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last =Ingram| first =Gordon Brent| title = Contests over social memory in waterfront Vancouver: Historical editing & obfuscation through public art| publisher = on the w@terfront| date = [[2 February]] [[2000]]| url = http://www.ub.es/escult/Water/tress/gordon.htm| accessdate =2006-12-31}}</ref>

The event has also been commemorated through references in television, theatre, and popular music. A play about the shootings by Adam Kelly called ''The Anorak'' was named as one of the best plays of 2004 by the ''[[Montreal Gazette]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stage Productions: The Anorak|publisher=Queen's University Faculty of Applied Science|url=http://appsci.queensu.ca/ilc/events/playwritingcomp/anorak.php|accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref> Additionally, several songs have been written about the events in different musical genres, including "Montreal" by rock band [[The Tragically Hip]], "Montreal Massacre" by the death metal band [[Macabre (band)|Macabre]], and "This Memory" by the folk duo the [[Wyrd Sisters (band)|Wyrd Sisters]]. "Gunshow", the [[List of Law & Order episodes (season 10)|season ten]] premiere episode of ''[[Law & Order]]'', was based partly on this event and the [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine shooting]].
