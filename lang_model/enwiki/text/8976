The '''M62 motorway''' is a west-east [[Pennines|trans-Pennine]] [[motorway]] in northern [[England]], connecting the cities of [[Liverpool]] and [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]. The road also forms part of the unsigned [[International E-road network|Euroroutes]] [[European route E20|E20]] ([[Shannon, County Clare|Shannon]] to [[Saint Petersburg]]) and [[European route E22|E22]] ([[Holyhead]] to [[Ishim]]). The road is {{convert|107|mi|km}} long;<ref name="mwdb">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m62/|title=M62 motorway|work=Motorway Database|publisher=CBRD|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref> however, for seven<ref name="m1-898">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/reference/m1-m898/assets/m1-m898.html|title=M1-M898 waypoints|publisher=CBRD|accessdate=2007-11-17}}</ref> miles, it [[Concurrency (road)|shares its route]] with the [[M60 motorway]] around [[Manchester]].

The motorway, which was first proposed in the 1930s, and originally conceived as two separate routes, was built in stages between 1971 and 1976, with construction beginning at Pole Moor and finishing in [[Tarbock]]. The motorway also absorbed part of the Stretford-Eccles bypass, which was built between 1957 and 1960. Adjusted for inflation to 2007, the motorway cost approximately [[GBP|GB<U+00A3>]]765 million to build.<ref name="simmons_consultancy">{{cite paper |author= David Simmons consultancy |title=Case Study:M62 motorway |accessdate=2007-05-30 |url=http://www.davidsimmonds.com/main/pdfs/m62.pdf}} "CEC (1987) estimated that the capital cost of the motorway was "of the order of <U+00A3>412 million at 1985 prices"." The inflation rates are taken from [http://www.whatsthecost.com/historic.cpi.aspx historical CPI figures].</ref> The motorway is relatively busy, with a average daily traffic flow of 100,000 cars in Yorkshire, and has several areas prone to gridlock, in particular, between [[Leeds]] and [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] in [[West Yorkshire]].

The road passes the cities of [[Salford]], [[Manchester]], [[Bradford]], [[Leeds]] and [[Wakefield]]. Between Liverpool and Manchester, and east of Leeds, the terrain of the road is relatively flat, while between Manchester and Leeds, the road crosses the hilly Pennines to its highest point on [[Saddleworth Moor]] ({{coord|53.62982|-2.018561|region:GB_type:landmark|name=Saddleworth Moor}}), which is also the highest point of any motorway in Britain, at {{convert|1221|ft|m}} above [[sea level]].<ref name="mtar">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bradford/content/articles/2006/11/30/m62_spencer_feature.shtml|title=More than a road...|author=Spencer Stokes|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]]|date=[[2006-12-01]]|accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref>

==History==

===Origin of the road===
The origins of the M62 date back to the 1930s, where the need for a route between [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]] had been agreed after discussion by the respective highway authorities of the counties.<ref name="mcr">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m62ecclesbdy.htm|title=M62: Eccles to county boundary|publisher=The Motorway Archive|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref> At the same time, it was envisaged that a route between Liverpool and Hull was also needed, connecting the two ports to industrial Yorkshire.<ref name="wry">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m62master.htm|title=M62 in West Yorkshire|publisher=The Motorway Archive|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref>

Some years later, after [[World War II]], the [[Secretary of State for Transport|Minister of Transport]] appointed engineers to inspect road standards between the [[A580 road]] in [[Swinton, Greater Manchester|Swinton]] and the [[A1 road]] near [[Selby]].<ref name="wry" /> In 1949, that year's Road Plan for South Lancashire specified the need for the [[dual carriageway|dualling]] and [[grade separation]] of the [[A580 road]], and bypasses of both [[Huyton]] and [[Cadishead]],<ref name="mersey">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m62queeccles.htm|title=M62: Queens Drive to Eccles|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref> and in 1952, the route for a trans-Pennine motorway, known as '''The [[Lancashire]]-[[Yorkshire]] Motorway''', was laid down, with [[Ferrybridge]] chosen as the eastern terminus rather than Selby.<ref name="wry" /> By the 1960s, however, the proposed dualling of the A580 in Lancashire was considered inadequate, and there was "an urgent need" to link Liverpool to the motorway network.<ref name="mersey" /> The route of the Lancashire-Yorkshire motorway was also considered inadequate as it failed to cater for several industrial towns in Yorkshire.<ref name="wry" /> When James Drake visited the United States in 1962, his experience with the [[Interstate Highway system]] led him to conclude that the '''Merseyside Expressway''' planned only to run between Liverpool and the [[M6 motorway|M6]], would need extending to the [[M63 motorway|Stretford-Eccles Bypass]], thus creating a continuous motorway between Liverpool and [[Ferrybridge]] (a link between Ferrybridge and Hull was not considered until 1964).<ref name="archive_ouse" /> Initially these plans were unpopular and unsupported by the [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]], but nevertheless the scheme was added to the Road Plan in 1963.<ref name="mersey" />

===Construction===
====The Liverpool Inner Motorway====
Originally, Liverpool was intended to have an urban motorway along with Manchester, Leeds, and Newcastle.<ref name="lim">{{cite web|url=http://cbrd.co.uk/histories/lim/|title=Liverpool Inner Motorway|work=Histories|publisher=CBRD|accessdate=2007-11-19}}</ref> In the latter cases, the motorways were constructed (the [[A57(M) motorway|A57(M)]], [[A58(M) motorway|A58(M)]], and [[A167(M) motorway|A167(M)]] respectively). The M62 was intended to terminate upon the Inner Motorway, but due to the Inner Motorway not being constructed, the M62 link was not constructed either.<ref name="urbanm62">{{cite web|url=http://cbrd.co.uk/histories/lim/m62.shtml|title=The Urban M62|work=Histories - Liverpool Inner Motorway|publisher=CBRD|accessdate=2007-11-19}}</ref> The proposed route would follow the railway into Liverpool as far as [[Edge Hill railway station|Edge Hill]], with junctions with Rathbone Road and Durning Road, dropping two lanes at the latter, before terminating on the Islington Radial.<ref name="urbanm62" />

====West of Manchester====
Originally, the section of the M62 west of [[Manchester]] was intended to be a separate motorway linking [[Liverpool]] with [[Salford]], but a continuous motorway between [[Leeds]] and Liverpool was deemed to be more feasible,<ref name="pathetic_m52" /><ref name="m602_cbrd">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m602/|title=M602 Motorway|work=Motorway Database|publisher=CBRD|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref> known as the '''M52'''. Construction of the motorway between Liverpool and Manchester started in 1971, with the construction of a link between the [[M57 motorway|M57]] and the [[M6 motorway]].<ref name="mersey" /> Concurrently, a contract to link the M6 with Manchester was under way, which required the removal of unsuitable material and drainage of the land. This section was completed in August 1974, creating a continuous link between [[Ferrybridge]] and [[Tarbock]].

The section between Tarbock and Liverpool was the last section of the motorway to be completed, in 1976, due to the difficulties of building an urban motorway. In total, two [[viaduct]]s, ten bridges and seven underpasses had to be constructed to secure the structural integrity of the surrounding residential area. The motorway, however, reached only as far as Queen's Drive (Junction 4), leaving the first three junctions unbuilt.<ref name="mersey" />

====In Greater Manchester====
{{seealso|M60 motorway}}
{{seealso|M602 motorway}}
{{seealso|M63 motorway}}

The first part of the M62 to be built was the Stretford-Eccles Bypass, which now covers junctions 7 to 13 of the [[M60 motorway|M60]].<ref name="pathetic_stretford">{{cite web|title=M62 Stretford-Eccles Bypass|url=http://pathetic.org.uk/lost/m62/|accessdate=2007-05-28|publisher=Pathetic Motorways}}</ref> Construction started in 1957, and opened in 1960.<ref name="seb">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m63stretecc.htm|title=M63 (now M60) Stretford-Eccles Bypass and Carrington Spur|accessdate=2007-05-28|publisher=The Motorway Archive}}</ref>

Two separate motorways were planned, with the M52 running from [[Liverpool]] into [[Salford]]; the other, the M62, would link Pole Moor with the Stretford-Eccles Bypass.<ref name="pathetic_m52">{{cite web|url=http://pathetic.org.uk/lost/m52/|title=M52 Liverpool to Manchester|accessdate=2007-05-28|publisher=Pathetic Motorways}}</ref> The section between the interchange with the Stretford-Eccles Bypass and Salford is now occupied by the [[M602 motorway]].

The Eccles-Pole Moor section was opened in 1971.<ref name="cbrd_m62_timeline">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m62/timeline.shtml|title=M62 - Timeline|publisher=CBRD|work=Motorway Database|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref><ref name="cbrd_m60_timeline">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m60/timeline.shtml|title=M60 - Timeline|publisher=CBRD|work=Motorway Database|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref> Of this, the first section to be built was a one-mile extension of the Stretford-Eccles Bypass to [[Worsley]]. Between Eccles and Pole Moor, sixty-seven crossings of the motorway were required, including seven viaducts and eight junctions.<ref name="mcr" />

====Between Saddleworth and Lofthouse====
The first section of the Yorkshire section of the motorway was completed in 1970, between the county boundary on [[Saddleworth Moor]] and [[Outlane]].<ref name="mwdb" /><ref name="polemoor">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m62bounpole.htm|title=M62: Boundary to Pole Moor|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=The Motorway Archive}}</ref> The construction of the section between Saddleworth and Pole Moor was a difficult task, given the inhospitable hilly terrain, numerous [[peat bog]]s, and undesirable weather conditions. To build this section of motorway, {{convert|12000000|cuyd|cum}} of material was moved, {{convert|8000000|cuyd|cum}} of which were solid rock; {{convert|650000|cuyd|cum}} of this material was [[peat]], which had to be cut from the [[rock strata]] and was eventually deposited on hillsides adjacent to the motorway. In addition to the problems caused by removal of the material, the geology of the moors resulted in the engineers needing to split the carriageways for three-quarters of a mile in the middle of this section, sparing Stott Hall Farm from demolition.<ref name="polemoor" /><ref name="bbc_fastlane">{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2007/02/02/020207_insideout_farmhouse_feature.shtml|title=Farming in the fast lane|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=[[2007-02-02]]|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref> Two notable bridge constructions were the bridge carrying the [[Pennine Way]], which is curved downwards with 85 foot long [[cantilever]]s, and [[Scammonden]] Bridge, often called the longest single-span non-suspension bridge in Britain,<ref name="cbrd-simluator">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/cgi-bin/simu.pl?road=m62w-25|accessdate=2007-05-30|title=M62|work=Motorway Simulator|publisher=CBRD}}</ref> which carries a [[B road]] 120 feet above the motorway.<ref name="polemoor" /> The mile-long section between Pole Moor and Outlane suffered fewer problems, with the summer weather being satisfactory.<ref name="pmtool">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m62poleoutl.htm|title=M62: Pole Moor to Outlane|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=The Motorway Archive}}</ref> Concurrently, a section of the motorway was being built between [[Gildersome]] and [[Lofthouse, West Yorkshire|Lofthouse]],<ref name="mwdb" /> resulting in the demolition of a significant proportion of the village of [[Tingley]] to build the eponymous interchange.

====Between the M1 and A1====
Two contracts were awarded for the section of the M62 between [[Lofthouse]] and [[Ferrybridge]] in 1972, and both were completed in 1974.<ref name="archive_2931">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m62lofthope.htm|title=M62: Lofthouse to Hopetown|publisher=The Motorway Archive|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref><ref name="archive_3133">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m62hopeferry.htm|title=M62: Hopetown to Ferrybridge|publisher=The Motorway Archive|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref> On the first contract, care was needed at the crossing of the [[River Calder]] due to the [[alluvial]] bedrock, while, on the second, precautions were taken as the length was built on old [[coal mining|coal mine]] workings.

====East of Ferrybridge====
[[Image:Ouse bridge.jpg|thumb|right|The [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|Ouse]] bridge, from the floodplain adjacent to the river.]]
The sections between Ferrybridge and [[North Cave]] were of the last sections of the motorway to be conceived<ref name="archive_ouse" /> and built.<ref name="cbrd_m62_timeline" /> One of the most notable features is the bridge crossing the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]] west of [[Goole]], a structure nearly one mile long, rising to thirty meters above ground level, which commenced construction in January 1973. 

The bridge was delayed due to "steel supplies [being] a chronic headache"<ref name="nce">{{Citation|last = Hayward|first = David|newspaper = New Civil Engineer|date = [[1975-08-14]]}}</ref> and a partial collapse of the framework, caused by bolts joining a cross-beam to a trestle shearing.<ref name="archive_ouse">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m62goolouse.htm|title=M62: Goole - Ouse Bridge|publisher=The Motorway Archive|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref> The problems with the Ouse Bridge pushed the opening of the whole section east of [[Goole]] back to May 1976.<ref name="cbrd_m62_timeline" /><ref name="archive_ouse" />

===Development after opening===
[[Image:A1(M) and M62 interchange.jpg|thumb|left|Junction 32a during construction in [[September 2005]].]]
After its completion, the M62 experienced no major changes until 2000, when the section of the M62 between Eccles Interchange and Simister Interchange (junctions 12 to 18) was renamed to the [[M60 motorway|M60]].<ref name="cbrd_m60">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m60/|title=M60|work=Motorway Database|publisher=CBRD|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref> Since then, two new junctions were opened - in December 2002, the previously missing Junction 8 was opened to allow access to the [[A574 road|A574]] and a new retail park,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.costain.com/news/bpfeb03/newsindepth8.htm|title=M62 junction completion raises region's economic prospects|publisher=[[Costain Group]]|date=2003|accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref> while in January 2006, Junction 32a was opened, to link the motorway with the recently upgraded [[A1 road|A1(M)]].<ref name="hwa_newsletter">{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/documents/n050282_F_HM_NEWSLETTER.pdf|title=A1(M) Ferrybridge to Hook Moor open to Traffic - January 2006|publisher=[[Highways Agency]]|date=2005|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref> The UK's first [[High occupancy vehicle lane|car-sharing lane]] on a motorway is planned to be opened at Junction 26, allowing any eastbound traffic from the [[M606 motorway|M606]] with more than one occupant to use the lane,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bradford/4822808.stm|title=First car-share lane to be built|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2006-03-20]]|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref> while a proposal to widen the motorway to four lanes between Junctions 25 and 28 to reduce congestion is in the planning stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/knowledge/10575.aspx|title=M1 and M62 Motorway Improvements in Yorkshire|accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref>

===Incidents===
====Coach bombing====
{{main|M62 coach bombing}}
On [[4 February]] [[1974]], a bomb was detonated on a coach containing off duty [[British Army|army personnel]] and family members,  between Chain Bar (Junction 26) and Gildersome (Junction 27), resulting in the deaths of 12 people and injuries in 38 other people. The [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] were deemed responsible for the attacks.<ref name="coach">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/crime/article/0,2763,634024,0.html|title=Miscarriages of justice|date=[[2002-01-15]]|accessdate=2007-05-29|publisher=''[[Guardian Unlimited]]''}}</ref>

====Rail crash====

On [[28 February]] [[2001]], at 06:13 [[GMT]], Gary Hart, a [[sleep deprivation|sleep-deprived]] driver, swerved off the M62 onto the [[East Coast Main Line]] near [[Selby]]. While Hart was calling the [[emergency services]], a [[GNER]] southbound train collided with Hart's [[Land Rover]], and subsequently derailed into the path of an oncoming [[freight train]]. 10 people, including the train drivers, were killed, and a further 82 were injured.

==Impact upon culture==

The M62 motorway is mentioned in a number of songs. One of the earliest songs is "Driving Away From Home (Jim's Tune)" by [[It's Immaterial]], a 1986 song which described the motorway as a way of getting to Manchester from the band's hometown of Liverpool.<ref>{{cite video

[[Image:Map of the M62 motorway - section.svg|thumb|right|250px|The M62's route in relation to the four major cities it serves: Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and Hull.]]
In addition to passing Warrington, Manchester, Huddersfield, Halifax, Bradford, Leeds and Wakefield, the towns of Huyton, St Helens, Widnes, Bury, Rochdale, Dewsbury, Pontefract, Selby and Goole are designated as [[Primary status|primary destination]]s along the road. The road is a terminus to two motorways: the [[M57 motorway]] near Prescot and the [[M18 motorway]] near [[Rawcliffe, East Riding of Yorkshire|Rawcliffe]]; and has four spur routes: the [[M602 motorway]], which serves Manchester, the [[A627(M) motorway]], which serves Oldham, the [[M606 motorway]], which serves Bradford, and the [[M621 motorway]], which serves Leeds. Despite Hull being listed as a primary destination,<ref name="simj30">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/cgi-bin/simu.pl?road=m62e-33|publisher=CBRD|title=M62 East - Junction 30|work=Motorway simulator|accessdate=2007-11-17}}</ref> the motorway downgrades near North Cave, sixteen miles west.<ref name="mwdb" /><ref name="simj38">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/cgi-bin/simu.pl?road=m62e-44|publisher=CBRD|title=M62 East - Junction 38|work=Motorway simulator|accessdate=2007-11-17}}</ref>

The motorway starts on Queen's Drive, on Liverpool's middle ring road. From there it runs eastward to Liverpool's outer ring road, the M57. The route has three exits for Warrington: Junction 8, which also houses Ikea,<ref name="simj8">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/cgi-bin/simu.pl?road=m62e-7|publisher=CBRD|title=M62 East - Junction 8|work=Motorway simulator|accessdate=2007-11-17}}</ref> Junction 9, which interchanges with the [[A49 road]], originally intended to be a motorway itself,<ref name="simj9">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/cgi-bin/simu.pl?road=m62e-8|publisher=CBRD|title=M62 East - Junction 9|work=Motorway simulator|accessdate=2007-11-17}}</ref> and Junction 11. Between these is Junction 10, which is a [[Stack interchange#Cloverstack|cloverstack interchange]] with the [[M6 motorway]]. The M62 then crosses [[Chat Moss]] before interchanging with the [[M60 motorway]].<ref name="simuneven">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/cgi-bin/simu.pl?road=m62e-11|publisher=CBRD|title=M62 East - Uneven surface (Chat Moss)|work=Motorway simulator|accessdate=2007-11-17}}</ref> Due to original plans being to extend the section of the motorway into Manchester, motorists must turn off to stay on the route into Yorkshire.

[[Image:M62 near Irlam, Salford.jpg|thumb|left|The M62 near [[Irlam]], the original eastern terminus, in the [[blue hour|early hours of the morning.]]]] 
In Greater Manchester, the motorway shares seven junctions, 12 to 18, with the M60 motorway. Junction 13, which is signposted for Swinton, is situated only half a mile from Junction 12, leaving exiting motorists the hazard of crossing the still-merging M62 traffic.<ref name="simunj13">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/cgi-bin/simu.pl?road=m60c-17|publisher=CBRD|title=M60 Clockwise - Junction 13|work=Motorway simulator|accessdate=2007-11-17}}</ref>After this, there is Worsley Braided Interchange, which, in addition to serving Junctions 14 and 15, also serves Junctions 1 to 3 of the [[M61 motorway]], which terminates to [[Preston]]. 

[[Image:M62 motorway, Calderdale.jpg|thumb|right|The M62 passes Scammonden Water in [[West Yorkshire]].]]
Near Junction 22, the motorway gains a lane to climb Windy Hill,<ref name="simuneven">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/cgi-bin/simu.pl?road=m62e-19|publisher=CBRD|title=M62 East - Gain in lane (Windy Hill)|work=Motorway simulator|accessdate=2007-11-17}}</ref> before crossing the border into Yorkshire and interchanging with the rural A672 road, reaching the highest point of any motorway in England on the bridge. There is then a seven-mile travel through the Pennines to the next junction, passing Scammonden Water and Stott Hall Farm. The next junction is Junction 23, which is only accessible for westbound traffic. After this, the road dips through a valley to Junction 24<ref name="simj24">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/cgi-bin/simu.pl?road=m62e-25|publisher=CBRD|title=M62 East - Junction 24|work=Motorway simulator|accessdate=2007-11-17}}</ref> and drops slowly before interchanging with the A644 road at Junction 25.<ref name="simlorry">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/cgi-bin/simu.pl?road=m62w-22|publisher=CBRD|title=M62 West - Slow Lorries (Brighouse-Halifax)|work=Motorway simulator|accessdate=2007-11-17}}</ref> Between Junctions 22 and 25, the road is used as a border between the metropolitan boroughs of [[Calderdale]] and [[Kirklees]].<ref name="cmbc">{{cite web|url=http://www.calderdale.gov.uk/council/consultations/engage/downloaddoc.jsp?id=802|title=Waste Management Strategy|publisher=[[Calderdale MBC]]|format=[[PDF]]|accessdate=2007-11-17}}</ref>

At Junction 26, named Chain Bar, the motorway interchanges with several roads: the M606 motorway, a spur into Bradford, the [[A58 road]], which runs between Prescot and [[Wetherby]], and the [[A638 road]], which runs to Doncaster. The next junction also serves a spur route: the M621 motorway, before bypassing Leeds to the south to the interchange with the M1 motorway, Lofthouse Interchange, at Junction 29. East of Leeds, the motorway serves [[Wakefield]] at Junction 30 and crosses by the [[River Calder]]. At Junction 32a, the road is crossed by the [[A1(M) motorway]], which also runs parallel to it for a short distance. The next junction serves the A162 road, previously the A1, and Ferrybridge service station. After Ferrybridge, the motorway becomes relatively flat, except for a mile-long bridge that crosses the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]]. For approximately ten miles after this, the road runs towards Hull, serving [[Howden]] and North Cave, before downgrading to the A63 road.
