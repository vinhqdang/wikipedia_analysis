The '''New Jersey Devils''' are a professional [[ice hockey]] team based in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]. They are members of the [[Atlantic Division (NHL)|Atlantic Division]] of the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). The Devils have won the [[Stanley Cup]] three times, in 1995, 2000, and 2003. The club was founded in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] in 1974, moved to [[Denver, Colorado]] after only two seasons, and then settled in New Jersey in 1982. Under current [[general manager]] [[Lou Lamoriello]], the Devils have earned a playoff spot in each of the last nine seasons, and in 17 of the last 19 seasons.<ref name="Playoffs">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsline.com/nhl/teams/history/NJ| title = New Jersey Devils History| accessdate = 2006-11-19| publisher = CBS Sportsline}}</ref>

Since their move to New Jersey, the Devils have played their home games at the [[Continental Airlines Arena]]. In 2007, the team is expected to move to the [[Prudential Center]], which is under construction in the city of [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]].<ref name="groundbreak">{{cite web|url=http://www.newjerseydevils.com/2005/html/theteam/teamnews/nwk-groundbreaking.php|title=Newark Breaks Ground for Devils Arena|accessdate=2006-08-30|year=2005|publisher=New Jersey Devils}}</ref> They have [[National Hockey League rivalries|rivalries]] with their trans-[[Hudson River|Hudson]] neighbor, the [[New York Rangers]],<ref name="RivalRangers">{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcsports.com/nhl/186606/detail.html|title=Devils visit rival Rangers for first time in '06<U+2013>07|accessdate=2006-11-14|year=2006|publisher=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> and with the [[Philadelphia Flyers]], as either the Devils or Flyers have won the [[Atlantic Division (NHL)|Atlantic Division]] title every season since 1995.<ref name="atlantic">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/history/fstand90s.html|title=Final Standings:1990's|accessdate=2006-11-13|year=2006|publisher=NHL.com}}</ref><ref name="atlantic2">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/history/fstand2000s.html|title=Final Standings:2000's|accessdate=2006-11-13|year=2006|publisher=NHL.com}}</ref>

== Franchise history ==
===Kansas City and Colorado===
{{see also|Kansas City Scouts|Colorado Rockies (NHL)}}
In 1974, the NHL ended its first [[Expansion team|expansion]] period by adding teams in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], and [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rauzulusstreet.com/hockey/nhlhistory/nhlhistory.html|title=National Hockey League (NHL) Expansion History|accessdate=2006-08-30|publisher=Rauzulu's Street}}</ref> The Kansas City franchise was to be called the Mohawks, since the Kansas City metropolitan area includes portions of Missouri and [[Kansas]].  However, the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] objected to the similarity. The team was renamed the [[Kansas City Scouts|Scouts]] after a statue in the city.<ref name="kcscouts">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/kansascity/kcscouts.html|title=History of the Kansas City Scouts|work=Sports E-Cyclopedia|publisher=Tank Productions|accessdate=2006-03-25}}</ref>
[[Image:Kansas_city_scouts_logo.JPG|thumb|110px|left|Logo of the Kansas City Scouts (1974<U+2013>1976)]] On [[October 9]], [[1974]], the Scouts took the ice for the first time in [[Toronto]] and lost 6-2 to the [[Toronto Maple Leafs|Maple Leafs]]. Due to a [[rodeo]] being held in Kansas City's brand-new [[Kemper Arena]], the Scouts were forced to wait nine games before making their home debut. Although they lost that game to the Black Hawks 4-3, the next night they beat fellow newcomer the [[Washington Capitals]] 5-4. The Scouts failed to make the playoffs in either season in Kansas City and won only 27 of 160 games. 

The team began to suffer from the economic downturn in the Midwest.  For their second season, the Scouts sold just 2,000 of 8,000 [[season ticket]]s and was almost $1 million in debt. Due to these on- and off-ice disappointments, the franchise moved to [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] and was renamed the [[Colorado Rockies (NHL)|Colorado Rockies]].<ref name="kcscouts" />
[[Image:COL-R 233.gif|thumb|120px|right|Logo of the Colorado Rockies (1976<U+2013>1982)]]
The team made a fresh start in Colorado, winning its first game 4-2 over Toronto. They picked up momentum and looked like a possible playoff contender, but things collapsed in February, and the Rockies finished the [[1976-77 NHL season|1976-77 season]] with a record of 20-46-14. The next season, despite finishing with fewer wins, they managed to edge the [[Vancouver Canucks]] out of the last playoff spot by two points, but were quickly eliminated by the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in the first round.

Prior to the [[1978-79 NHL season|1978-79 season]], owner Jack Vickers sold the team to Arthur Imperatore, who announced that he wished to move the team to the [[New Jersey Meadowlands]]. The NHL vetoed the move, requiring the team to remain in Denver until the [[Continental Airlines Arena|Brendan Byrne Arena]] was complete. In 1979, the team hired [[Don Cherry (ice hockey)|Don Cherry]] as head coach and traded for Maple Leafs star [[Lanny McDonald]], but despite these moves, the Rockies posted the worst record in the league. They played the next two seasons with the possibility of moving until [[May 27]], [[1982]], when New Jersey shipping tycoon [[John McMullen (engineer)|John McMullen]] purchased the team and announced that the long-expected move to New Jersey would finally come to pass.<ref name="rockies">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/colnj/nhlrockies.html|title=History of the Colorado Rockies|work=Sports E-Cyclopedia|publisher=Tank Productions|accessdate=2006-03-25}}</ref> 

The team would now be playing right in the middle of the [[New York]]<U+2013>New Jersey<U+2013>[[Connecticut]] [[tri-state area]], home to the three-time defending [[Stanley Cup]] champion [[New York Islanders]], as well as the [[New York Rangers]].

The team was renamed the New Jersey Devils on [[June 30]], [[1982]]. Over 10,000 people voted in a contest held by local newspapers to select the name,<ref>{{cite news |first=Lawrie |last=Mifflin |coauthors=Katz, Michael |title=SCOUTING; 'Jersey Devils' Wins Name Poll |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40E17F8395F0C738FDDAF0894DA484D81&n=Top%2fNews%2fSports%2fHockey%2fNational%20Hockey%20League%2fNew%20Jersey%20Devils

In the following season, the Devils were publicly humiliated by [[Wayne Gretzky]] after they were blown out 13-4 by his team, the [[Edmonton Oilers]]. Gretzky was upset that former teammate [[Ron Low]] played for what he considered an inferior team, and in a post-game interview said:

{{cquote|Well, it's time they got their act together. They're ruining the whole league. They had better stop running a [[Mickey Mouse Operation|Mickey Mouse organization]] and put somebody on ice.<ref name="mickeymouse">{{cite web|url=http://www.cyber-kat.com/njdevils/history.html|title=a History of the NJ Devils Hockey Team|publisher=Kat's Devils Den|accessdate=2006-03-25}}</ref>}}

Later, Gretzky publicly admitted that his comment went too far, but privately maintained that his comment was accurate.<ref name="gretzkyapology">{{cite web|url=http://couchpotatohockey.com/Teams/Team Biographies/New_Jersey.asp|title=New Jersey Devils Team Biography|publisher=Couchpotatohockey|accessdate=2006-03-25}}</ref> In response, many Devils fans wore Mickey Mouse apparel when the Oilers returned to New Jersey.<ref name="mickeymouse" />

In the [[1983-84 NHL season|1983-84 season]], the Devils hosted the annual [[NHL All-Star Game]] at the Brendan Byrne Arena. [[Glenn "Chico" Resch]] was the winning goaltender, and Devils defenseman [[Joe Cirella]] tallied a goal as the Wales Conference beat the Campbell Conference 7-6.<ref name="datesinhistory" /> However, the team did not achieve much success. Head coach [[Bill MacMillan]] was fired midway through the season and replaced with [[Tom McVie]], and the Devils posted their worst record in team history, finishing 17-56-7. After the season, McVie was replaced by [[Doug Carpenter]].

Meanwhile, the Devils had begun building a nucleus of young players. [[John MacLean]], [[Kirk Muller]], and [[Pat Verbeek]] all complemented the veteran leadership of Resch. The team's record improved each season between 1984 and 1987.  However, the presence of the powerful Islanders, Flyers and Capitals in the [[Patrick Division]] meant that the Devils found themselves in a losing battle  with the Rangers and [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] for the division's last playoff spot.

Hoping to light a spark under the team, McMullen hired [[Providence College]] coach and athletic director [[Lou Lamoriello]] as team president in April 1987.  Lamoriello appointed himself [[general manager]] shortly before the [[1987-88 NHL season|1987-88 season]].  This move sent shock waves across the league.  Although Lamoriello had been a college coach for 19 years, he had never played, coached, or managed in the NHL. 

The 1987-88 Devils garnered the first winning record in the franchise's 13-year history. On the final day of the regular season, they were tied with their nemesis, the Rangers, for the final playoff spot in the Patrick Division. After New York defeated the [[Quebec Nordiques]] 3-0, all eyes were on the Devils, who were playing the Blackhawks in Chicago. The Devils were trailing 3-2 midway through the third period when John MacLean tied the game, and with two minutes left in overtime, he added the winning goal.  Although the Rangers and Devils both finished with 82 points, the Devils had one more win, sending them to the playoffs for the second time in franchise history.<ref>http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/nj/njdevils.html New Jersey Devils on SportsEcyclopedia</ref>

The team made it all the way to the conference finals, but lost to the [[Boston Bruins]] in seven games. In that series, head coach [[Jim Schoenfeld]] verbally abused referee [[Don Koharski]], screaming obscenties and suggesting the official "have another donut". The incident resulted in a suspension for Schoenfeld, which the franchise appealed to the [[New Jersey Superior Court]]. This unprecedented appeal to authority outside the NHL gave the Devils a preliminary stay of the coach's suspension. In protest, referee Dave Newell and the assigned linesmen boycotted the next scheduled New Jersey<U+2013>Boston playoff match. Two linesmen from youth leagues were found in the stands to work the game wearing yellow practice jerseys. To resolve the incident, the NHL suspended Schoenfeld for the next game. Schoenfeld later admitted he regretted his comments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeydraftcentral.com/1972/72005.html|title=Jim Schoenfeld: The Koharski Incident|publisher=HockeyDraftCentral.com}}</ref>

The following season, the Devils once again slipped below .500 and missed the playoffs. Lamoriello made several postseason player changes, notably signing of the first two [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] stars to play in the NHL: [[Viacheslav Fetisov]] and [[Sergei Starikov]]. The Devils drafted Fetisov years earlier in the [[1983 NHL Entry Draft|1983 entry draft]], but the Soviet government would not allow Fetisov, who was an army officer as well as a member of the [[Soviet national ice hockey team|national team]], to leave the country.<ref>http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/spot_oneononep200101.htm One On One with Viacheslav Fetisov</ref> Shortly after, the Devils signed Fetisov's defense partner, [[Alexei Kasatonov]].

The team changed coaches midway through each of the next two seasons. Schoenfeld was replaced with [[John Cunniff]] in [[1989-90 NHL season|1989-90]], and Tom McVie was re-hired midway through the [[1990-91 NHL season|1990-91 season]] and helmed the team through its third-straight first-round elimination in [[1991-92 NHL season|1991-92]]. [[Herb Brooks]], who coached the 1980 "[[Miracle on Ice]]" team, was brought in for the [[1992-93 NHL season|1992-93 season]], but when the team yet again was eliminated in the first round, he was fired and replaced with former [[Montreal Canadiens]] forward [[Jacques Lemaire]].<ref name="sportsnj">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/nj/njdevils.html|title=New Jersey Devils history|work=Sports E-Cyclopedia|publisher=Tank Productions|date=[[March 25]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-03-25}}</ref>

====1993<U+2013>2000====
Under Lemaire, the team roared through the [[1993-94 NHL season|1993-94 regular season]] with a lineup including defensemen [[Scott Stevens]] and [[Scott Niedermayer]], forwards [[Stephane Richer]], [[John MacLean (hockey)|John MacLean]], [[Bobby Holik]], and [[Claude Lemieux]], and goaltenders [[Chris Terreri]] and [[Martin Brodeur]], who was honored as the league's top rookie with the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]].<ref name="Calder">{{cite web|url=http://statshockey.homestead.com/calder.html| title = NHL Calder Trophy Winners| accessdate = 2006-11-25| publisher = Stats Hockey}}</ref> The Devils' first 100-point season earned them the NHL's second-best record behind the [[New York Rangers]].  However, due to the NHL's new playoff format, the Devils were seeded third in the East.  The rivals met in a memorable Eastern Conference Finals match up, which went seven games. The Devils had lost all six regular season meetings to the Blueshirts, but let the world know they were up for the challenge, after the Devils [[Stephane Richer]] scored the game winning goal in the second overtime. Going into game six the Devils led the series 3-2. Before the game Rangers captain [[Mark Messier]] made his famous guarantee that the Rangers would win game six. Keeping true to his word, Messier led his team back, netting a hat trick, and leading the Rangers to a 4-2 victory (after the Devils were up 2-0). In game seven, the Devils [[Valeri Zelepukin]] tied the deciding game with 7.7 seconds remaining, but the Devils were defeated in double overtime, on a goal by [[Stephane Matteau]]. The series is viewed by many hockey fans as one of the greatest playoff series in NHL history.

Despite the setback, the team returned to the Eastern Conference Finals during the [[1994-95 NHL lockout|lockout-shortened]] [[1994-95 NHL season|1994-95 season]] and defeated the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] four games to two. They swept the heavily favored [[Detroit Red Wings]] to win New Jersey's first-ever Stanley Cup, and the first professional sports championship in the state's history.  [[Claude Lemieux]] was awarded the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as playoffs MVP.  The Devils established an [[NHL]] record by posting 11 road victories in one playoff season. The success came amid constant rumors that the team would move for the third time in its history to Nashville, but the club remained in New Jersey.<ref>{{cite news |first = Susan|last=Keller |title = New Jersey Daily Briefing; Suing Over Meadowlands Lease |url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6DA103FF934A15756C0A963958260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fN%2fNew%20Jersey%20Sports%20and%20Exposition%20Authority |publisher = [[The New York Times]]|date=[[May 27]], [[1995]]|accessdate = 2006-08-30}}</ref>[[Image:1995Devils.jpg|thumb|275px|right|The 1995 Stanley Cup champions]]

The Devils missed the playoffs by 2 points the following season, with a 37-33-12 record.  It marked the first time in 26 years that a defending Cup Champion failed to reach the playoffs.  Throughout the remainder of the decade, the Devils failed to live up to expectations.  They were ousted by the [[New York Rangers]] in the second round of the [[1997]] playoffs, and were eliminated in the first round in each of the next two seasons.

But in [[1999-2000 NHL season|1999-00]], however, they reached the top again, defeating the defending champion [[Dallas Stars]] in six games to win the Stanley Cup for the second time. Stevens, Holik, Lemieux, Niedermayer, and Brodeur, all integral parts of the 1995 team, were augmented with new players acquired in the intervening five years including [[Patrik Elias]], [[Petr Sykora]], [[Jason Arnott]], [[Alexander Mogilny]], and rookies [[Brian Rafalski]], [[John Madden (ice hockey)|John Madden]], and Calder Trophy recipient [[Scott Gomez]]. A highlight of the Devils' second championship run was their come-from-behind victory in the conference finals. They trailed the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] three games to one, but rebounded to win the series. This was both the first time in Devils playoff history and in NHL Conference Finals history that a 3-1 deficit was surmounted.<ref name="2000ConfFinal">{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/mld/dailynews/16002345.htm| title = God Bless 'Em Anyway| accessdate = 2006-11-30| publisher = [[Philadelphia Daily News]]| last=Bowen|first=Les| date=2000-05-27}}</ref> Team captain [[Scott Stevens]] was named the winner of the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]],<ref name="ConnSmythe">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/trophies/smythe.html| title = NHL Conn Smythe Trophy Winners| accessdate = 2006-11-25| publisher = NHL.com}}</ref> and assisted on [[Jason Arnott]]'s [[Stanley Cup]] clinching goal in double-overtime of Game 6 in Dallas.

Shortly before this victory, McMullen sold the team to Puck Holdings, an affiliate of [[YankeeNets]], for $175 million. The owners wanted to use the Devils for programming on the [[YES Network]] and move both teams to a new arena in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]. (Neither of these proposals would become reality under Puck Holdings' ownership.)<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2004/1129/124_print.html|title=Ice Capades|last=Ozanian|first=Michael|date=[[2004]]-[[11-29]]|publisher=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=2006-08-31}}</ref> The new owners left the Devils' operations in Lamoriello's hands.  For the start of the next season, Lamoriello was appointed [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of both the Devils and Nets. He would remain at the helm of the basketball team until it was sold with the intention of moving it to [[Brooklyn]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/story/157436p-138260c.html|title=Lou will leave Nets,

====2001<U+2013>2004====
Led by the Elias-Arnott-Sykora line and the stellar play of goaltender [[Martin Brodeur]], the Devils reached the finals for the second straight year. They lost the series to the [[Colorado Avalanche]] despite leading 3-2 and having Game Six on home ice.  The team's strong regular season was recognized at the NHL's annual awards that year, with Madden becoming the first player in franchise history to win the [[Frank J. Selke Trophy]] (for top defensive forward), along with Brodeur and Stevens named as finalists for the [[Vezina Trophy]] (top goalie) and [[James Norris Memorial Trophy|Norris Trophy]] (top defensemen) awards respectively.

The next season, they were expected to be contenders once again,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/darren_eliot/news/2002/04/14/east_breakdown/|title=Devil of a surge: New Jersey looking good to come out of the East|last=Eliot|first=Darren|date=[[2002]]-[[04-14]]|publisher=[[CNN]]/[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=2006-08-30}}</ref> but were upset in the first round of the playoffs by the [[Carolina Hurricanes]].

In 2003, the Devils brought the Stanley Cup to [[New Jersey]] a third time, beating the [[Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] four games to three. The playoff run included a seven game conference final series victory over the [[Ottawa Senators]], who won the [[President's Trophy]] that season. [[Martin Brodeur]], [[Scott Stevens]], [[Scott Niedermayer]], [[Ken Daneyko]], and [[Sergei Brylin]] each won their third cup, and after the series, Daneyko, a long-time fan favorite,<ref name="Dano">{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/cup/2003-06-10-notes-daneyko_x.htm|title=Veteran Daneyko sees first action in last game|publisher=USA Today|date=2003-06-10|accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> announced his retirement. The Conn Smythe Trophy was awarded to Anaheim goaltender [[Jean-Sebastien Giguere]], who led the seventh-seeded Ducks in their surprising run to the finals, which included series victories over the top two seeds in the Western Conference.<ref name="Ducks">{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/playoffdisplay.php3?league=NHL1927&season=2003&leaguenm=NHL|title=2002-03 NHL Playoff Results|publisher=HockeyDB.com|accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> Giguere was the first player not on the championship team to be named playoff MVP since [[Ron Hextall]] in 1987. This upset Devils fans, since Brodeur outplayed Giguere in the finals, posting three shutout victories. Some hockey writers speculated a New Jersey player did not win because there were multiple candidates, resulting in a [[split vote]] among the sportswriters who select the winner.<ref name="PreSmythe03">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2003/06/06/conn_smythe030606.html|title=Who will win the Conn Smythe?|publisher=CBC Sports|accessdate=2006-11-28|date=2003-06-06}}</ref><ref name="GiguereSmythe">{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/cup/2003-06-09-giguere-smythe_x.htm|title=Trophy, stats no consolation for Giguere|publisher=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=2006-11-28|date=2003-06-09|last=Beaton|first=Rod}}</ref> However, Brodeur was awarded the Vezina Trophy as outstanding goaltender in the regular season for the first time in his career, and would take home the trophy again the following season.

That season, the Devils once again bowed out in the first round, losing to the Philadelphia Flyers. Near its end, [[Lehman Brothers]] executive [[Jeffrey Vanderbeek]], who had been a minority owner since the 2000 sale, purchased a controlling interest from Puck Holdings and resigned from Lehman Brothers to assume full-time ownership.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/03/sports/hockey/03DEVI.html|title=Wall Street Executive to Buy Devils|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=[[2004]]-[[03-03]]|accessdate=2006-08-30}}</ref>

On [[April 29]], [[2006]], the Devils won their first round Stanley Cup playoff series against the New York Rangers four games to none, extending their winning streak to fifteen games and marking the first time the Devils defeated their cross-river rival in a playoff series. The team's season ended in the next round with an 4-1 Game 5 loss to the [[Carolina Hurricanes]], who would go on to win the Stanley Cup.

==Style of play==
The Devils have been known as a defense-first team since Jacques Lemaire's tenure, when he implemented a system commonly called the ''[[neutral zone trap]]''.<ref name="unlocktrap">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCM/is_1_32/ai_107896436|title=Unlocking the Trap - defense - Industry Overview|date=November 2003|last=Kreiser|first=John|publisher=Hockey Digest|accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref> This system is designed to force teams to turn over the puck in the neutral zone leading to a counterattack.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCM/is_3_32/ai_112087316|title=Caught in a trap: almost every team in the NHL has implemented a "system," but what exactly does that mean?|date=January-February 2004|last=Kreiser|first=John|publisher=Hockey Digest|accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref> This style of play, coupled with poor attendance and television ratings, led the team to be chastized by the media and hockey fans for "making the NHL boring".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCM/is_3_29/ai_67492141|title=Boring is beautiful: the Devils' defense-first style may be hell to watch, but it's hard to argue with the results|date=January 2001|last=Anderson|first=Chris|publisher=Hockey Digest|accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref> Nevertheless, the Devils were successful using this style of play, and Devils coach Larry Robinson asserted that the Montreal Canadiens (who also won the Cup many times) he played on in the 1970s used a form of the trap, though it did not have a name.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_38_228/ai_n6206381|title=Scrap the trap<U+2014>please|date=2004-09-20|last=Yorio|first=Kara|publisher=[[The Sporting News]]|accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref>

Since Jacques Lemaire, the team has adopted less of a trap and more of a transitional, "run and gun" style of play.<ref name="pressure">{{cite news|url=http://www.sny.tv/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060930&content_id=1410377&oid=36218&vkey=15|title=Devils trying to love pressure|date=September 2006|publisher=SNY.tv|accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> Players such as [[John Madden (hockey)|John Madden]], who excels at shorthanded goals, have led the team in placing a greater emphasis on speed and forechecking for the puck.  Likewise, [[Scott Gomez]], [[Brian Gionta]], and [[Patrik Elias]] are known as strong playmakers on the offensive side of the ice.  Newcomers [[Zach Parise]] and [[Travis Zajac]] emphasize speed and solid puck handling.

==Team colors and mascot==

{{h3|Logo}}
[[Image:OldDevils.png|right|thumb|300px|The old green style jerseys used from 1982 to 1992]]   
[[Image:NewDevils.png|right|thumb|300px|The current jerseys used since 1992 (Note the JM patch was only worn during the 05<U+2013>06 season)]] 

The Devils' logo is a [[monogram]] of the letters "N" and "J", rendered with two devil horns at the top of the "J" and a pointed tail at the bottom. The monogram is red with a black outline, and sits inside an open black circle. The logo lays on a field of white in the middle of the chest on both uniforms. Prior to the 1992 season, the black circle and outline were green.

{{h3|Jerseys}}

The current team colors are red, black and white, and they can be seen on both the home and road jerseys. The home jersey, which was the team's road jersey until 2003 when the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] decided to switch home and road jerseys,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statenews.com/article.phtml?pk=15112|title=NHL 'quacked' up with hockey jersey switch|first=Kristofer|last=Karol|publisher=[[State News]]|date=[[January 27]], [[2003]]|accessdate=2006-08-30}}</ref> is dominantly red in color. There are three black and white stripes, one across each arm and one across the waist. The road jersey is the team's former home jersey, white in color with a similar design, except that the three stripes are black and red. The shoulders are draped with black on both uniforms. Before 1993, the uniforms were green and red with slightly different striping.<ref name="sportsnj" /> The Devils have yet to introduce a [[third jersey]], and are one of only 3 NHL teams (Detroit and Carolina are the others) to never have one.

{{h3|Mascot}}

The current mascot is "NJ Devil", a 7-foot tall devil who plays into the myth of the [[Jersey Devil]]. NJ Devil keeps the crowd excited, signs autographs, participates in entertainment during the intermissions, skates across the ice, and runs throughout the aisles of the Continental Airlines Arena to high five fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newjerseydevils.com/2003/community/mascot.html|title=NJ Devil - The Official Mascot of the New Jersey Devils|publisher=New Jersey Devils|year=2003|accessdate=2006-08-30}}</ref>

Prior to 1993, the mascot was "Slapshot", a large Devils [[hockey puck]] that would also interact with the fans. However, the man inside the costume, Brad Patrick Ebben, was fired after he improperly touched three women while in costume. To remove the stigma of the lawsuit, Slapshot was retired and has not returned since.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.citypaper.net/articles/112901/cs.cover2.shtml|title=Former Eagles mascot Dean Schoenewald is still crazy after all these years|date=[[November 29]], [[2001]]|first=Jon|last=Hart|accessdate=2006-08-30}}</ref>

The Devils have retired two numbers, both in 2006.<ref name="retired">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2006/01/07/devilsnumbers060107.html|title=Devils to retire numbers of Stevens, Daneyko|accessdate=2006-11-13|year=2006|publisher=CBC Sports}}</ref> On [[February 3]] they retired the number '''4''' of longtime defenseman and captain [[Scott Stevens]], who spent 13 seasons with the Devils.

Two Devils players have been inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]].
