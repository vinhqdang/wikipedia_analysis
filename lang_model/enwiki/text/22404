'''Franklin Knight Lane''' (July 15, 1864&nbsp;<U+2013> May 18, 1921) was an American [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] politician from [[California]] who served as [[United States Secretary of the Interior]] from 1913 to 1920.  He also served as a commissioner of the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]], and was the [[Democratic nominees for governor of california|Democratic nominee]] for [[governor of California]] in 1902, losing a narrow race in what was then a heavily [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] state.

Lane was born July 15, 1864 near [[Charlottetown]], [[Prince Edward Island]], in what was then a [[British Empire|British colony]] but which is now part of [[Canada]], and in 1871, his family moved to California. After attending the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] while working part time as a reporter, Lane became a New York correspondent for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', and later became editor and part owner of a newspaper.  Elected City Attorney of [[San Francisco]] in 1898, a post he held for five years, Lane ran in successive years for governor and for [[mayor of San Francisco]], losing both races.  In 1903, he received the support of the Democratic minority in the [[California State Legislature]] during the legislature's vote to elect a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from California.

Appointed a commissioner of the Interstate Commerce Commission by [[U.S. President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in 1905 and confirmed by the Senate the following year, Lane was reappointed in 1909 by President [[William Howard Taft]].  His fellow commissioners elected him as chairman in January 1913.  The following month, Lane accepted President-elect [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s nomination to become [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], a position in which he served almost seven years until his resignation in early 1920.  Lane's record on conservation was mixed: he supported the controversial [[Hetch Hetchy Reservoir]] project in [[Yosemite National Park]], which flooded a valley esteemed by many conservationists, but also presided over the establishment of the [[National Park Service]].

The former Secretary died of [[angina pectoris]] at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in [[Rochester, Minnesota]] on May 18, 1921.  Due to two decades of poorly-paid government service, and the expenses of his final illness, he left no estate, and a public fund was established to support his widow.  Newspapers reported that it was often said of Lane that had he not been born in what is now Canada, he would have become president.  In spite of that limitation, Lane was offered support for the Democratic nomination for Vice President, though he was [[United States Constitution|constitutionally]] ineligible for that office as well.

''Examiner'' owner [[William Randolph Hearst]] later denied responsibility for this policy, and stated that if Lane ever needed anything, he should send Hearst a telegram.  Lane retorted that if Hearst received a telegram purportedly signed by Lane, asking him to do anything, he could be sure it was a forgery.<ref name="chron"/>

Journalist [[Grant Wallace]] wrote of Lane at the time of the gubernatorial campaign:
<blockquote>That Lane is a man of earnestness and vigorous action is shown in&nbsp;... every movement. You sit down to chat with him in his office. As he grows interested in the subject, he kicks his chair back, thrusts his hands way to the elbows in his trouser pockets and strides up and down the room. With deepening interest he speaks more rapidly and forcibly, and charges back and forth across the carpet with the heavy tread of a grenadier.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lane|1922|p=4.}}</ref>
</blockquote>

At the time, the state legislatures still elected United States Senators, and in 1903, Lane received the vote of the state legislature's Democratic minority in the Senate election.<ref name = "americanyearbook"/>  However, the majority Republicans backed incumbent [[George Clement Perkins]], who was duly re-elected.  Later that year, City Attorney Lane ran for mayor of San Francisco, but again was defeated, finishing third in the race.<ref name = "igs"/>  He returned to the private practice of law,<ref name = "igs"/> and would not again stand for elective office.

Even before the mayoral election, there was support for Lane as a potential Democratic candidate for Vice President, though since he was born in what was by then a Canadian province he was ineligible under the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].  In an era when political convention delegates were far more free to make their own choice for Vice President than they are today, Lane wrote that he had heard that he could gain the support of the New York delegation, which he declined to do.<ref name = "chron"/>  While returning to California from a trip to Washington, D.C. to advocate the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir project, he stopped in [[Austin, Texas]] to confer with Democratic leaders and address the legislature.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lane|1922|p=42.}}</ref>  ''[[The New York Times]]'' saw this as part of a campaign to secure the vice-presidential nomination, and stated that he had been promised help from Texas.<ref>{{Citation

==Interstate Commerce Commission==
===Appointment and confirmation===
The railroad companies, which were loosely regulated by the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] (ICC), exercised great power in California due to the lack of alternate means of shipping freight.  Lane had taken cases against those corporations in his law practice, and, in his gubernatorial campaign, had argued that they had too much power.  In early 1904, [[Benjamin Wheeler]], president of the [[University of California]], suggested to [[Theodore Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] that Lane would be an admirable choice to serve on the ICC.  Roosevelt agreed, and promised to name him to the next ICC vacancy.  When that vacancy occurred in early 1905, Roosevelt forgot his promise and instead named retiring five-term Senator [[Francis Cockrell]] of [[Missouri]].  Wheeler wrote to remind Roosevelt that he had said he would name Lane.<ref name = "work"/>   Roosevelt apologized for his oversight, but noted that, as he had [[United States presidential election, 1904|just been re-elected]], "I shall make ample amends to Lane later".<ref name = "work">{{Citation

In December 1905, Commissioner [[Joseph W. Fifer]] resigned from the ICC and President Roosevelt named Lane to fill the remaining four years in his term.<ref name = "enc"/><ref name = "iccbook"/>  Opposition to the appointment came from Republicans, who pointed out that were the nominee to be confirmed by the Senate, three of the five commissioners would be from the minority Democratic Party.<ref name = "work"/>  The dispute held up Senate approval.  However, Republican Congressman [[William Peters Hepburn]] proposed legislation which, though its primary purpose was increased railroad regulation, would expand the Commission by two members.  Roosevelt indicated that he would appoint Republicans to the new positions, and opposition to Lane's nomination dissipated.  The resultant [[Hepburn Act]] was signed by President Roosevelt on June 29, 1906, while his nominee was confirmed the same day and was sworn in on July 2, 1906.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lane|1922|pp=61<U+2013>62.}}</ref>

The City of San Francisco suffered [[1906 San Francisco Earthquake|a severe earthquake]] on April 18, 1906.  Lane, who was living in [[Berkeley, California|north Berkeley]] while awaiting Senate confirmation, hurried to the city within hours of the earthquake to do what he could to help.  Mayor [[Eugene E. Schmitz]] immediately appointed him to the [[Committee of Fifty (1906)|Committee of Fifty]] to deal with the devastation of the earthquake and subsequent fire, and plan the rebuilding of the city.  According to Lane's friend, writer [[William Henry Irwin|Will Irwin]], Lane did not content himself with committee work, but personally fought the fire, helping to save much of the [[Western Addition, San Francisco, California|Western Addition]].  In late April, the commissioner-designate took the train east to Washington, where he unsuccessfully fought to obtain Federal money to help the city's recovery.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lane|1922|pp=59<U+2013>61.}}</ref>

===Commission work===
The new commissioner spent the second half of 1906 attending ICC hearings around the country.  The Hepburn Act had given the Commission broad powers over the railroads, and the Commission worked to deal not only with past railroad abuses, but to strike a balance between the desires of railroads and those of shippers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lane|1922|pp=63<U+2013>64.}}</ref>

[[File:Lane1909.jpg|thumb|left|Commissioner Lane in Chicago, 1909]]
There was a severe shortage of coal in the Upper [[Midwest]] in late 1906, especially in [[North Dakota]], and President Roosevelt ordered an investigation.  Railroad companies were accused of failing to send cars with coal to that region that could then be used to transport grain from that region to [[Great Lakes]] ports.  It was alleged the companies were waiting for the lakes to freeze over before sending cars so that the grain would have to be transported by rail all the way to market instead of by water transport.  Lane led the inquiry and held hearings in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], and concluded that the car shortage was due to demand for cars further west, and that it would actually cause area railways to lose money since they could not transport the grain to port.<ref>{{Citation

He found that fifty million bushels of grain still remained on North Dakota farms or in the state's grain elevators, due to lack of space in eastbound railroad cars.  He recommended that railroad companies pool their cars with neighboring lines.<ref>{{Citation| title = Car shortage costly| periodical = The New York Times| date = January 3, 1907| url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9F0CE7DC1731E733A25750C2A9649D946797D6CF| accessdate = 2009-01-27}}</ref>

The Commission spent much of 1907 investigating the railroads and other companies owned by [[Edward H. Harriman]], holding hearings across the country.  In October, Lane determined that the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], one of Harriman's lines, was engaged in rebating, a practice of effectively giving special rates to favored shippers that had been outlawed by the Hepburn Act.<ref>{{Citation| title = Harrison road still rebating | periodical = The New York Times| date = October 15, 1907 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=950DE6D6143EE733A25756C1A9669D946697D6CF | accessdate = 2009-01-27}}</ref>

Lane was reappointed as commissioner by President [[William Howard Taft]] on December 7, 1909, this time to a full seven-year term, and was confirmed by the Senate three days later.<ref name = "iccbook">{{Citation

Early in 1912, Commissioner Lane returned to New York to preside over hearings (begun on the Commission's own initiative) into [[pipeline transport|oil pipeline]]s.  While investigating the sale of pipelines to the [[Standard Oil|Standard Oil Company]], he grew frustrated with the testimony of a witness who, though secretary of several pipeline companies, could not say who authorized the sales.  "I don't want to deal with a clerk or one of your $5,000 a year men.  I want testimony from someone who can speak with authority."<ref>{{Citation

Lane also gave attention to improving the ICC's internal capabilities.  Lane and his ally, fellow Commissioner [[Balthasar H. Meyer]], supported increasing the Commission's ability to compute marginal rates, and the Commission engaged noted economist [[Max O.

==Secretary of the Interior==
===Selection by Wilson===
In the [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912 presidential election]], Lane supported Democratic candidate and [[Governor of New Jersey|New Jersey Governor]] [[Woodrow Wilson]], though he declined to make campaign speeches on Wilson's behalf, citing ICC policy that commissioners act in a nonpartisan manner.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lane|1922|p=106.}}</ref>  Wilson was elected on November 5, 1912, and on November 21 the commissioner spent much of the day with Colonel [[Edward House]], the President-elect's advisor, who would play a key role in selecting Cabinet appointees.  The possibility of Lane becoming Secretary of the Interior was discussed, but the commissioner indicated he was happy in his present position.<ref name = "house">{{Harvnb|Righter|2006|p=119.}}</ref>  After the meeting, Lane had second thoughts, and asked House if he would have a free hand as Interior Secretary.  House indicated that were he to prove capable in the position, Wilson would not interfere.  Colonel House did not immediately recommend Commissioner Lane for the job, but went on to consider other candidates, such as former San Francisco mayor [[James D. Phelan]] and Wilson friend [[Walter Hines Page|Walter Page]].<ref name = "house"/>

At the ICC meeting on January 8, 1913, the commissioners elected Lane as the new chairman, effective January 13.<ref>{{Citation

===Department activities===
[[File:Pres. Wilson--Cabinet of 1913.jpg|thumb|President Wilson and his Cabinet with Lane forward row, second from right]]
The [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] in 1913 was composed of an assortment of different agencies.  Many of them, such as the Pensions Office, [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|Indian Office]], and [[Bureau of Land Management|General Land Office]] had been departmental responsibilities since the Interior Department was organized in 1849.  Others, such as the Bureau of Education, the [[United States Geological Survey|Geological Survey]] and the Bureau of Mines, had been added later.<ref>{{Citation

Soon after taking office in 1913, Lane became involved in the Hetch Hetchy Valley dispute.  San Francisco had long sought to dam the [[Tuolumne River]] in Yosemite National Park to create a reservoir that would assure a steady flow of water to the city.  Franklin Lane had supported the project as City Attorney and continued his advocacy as the new Interior Secretary.<ref name = "int"/>  The Hetch Hetchy project was strongly opposed by many conservationists, led by [[John Muir]], who said, "Dam Hetch Hetchy! As well dam for water tanks the people's cathedrals and churches; for no holier temple has ever been consecrated by the heart of man."<ref name = "int">{{Citation

  | accessdate = 2009-01-27}}</ref>  In spite of Muir's objections, Lane was successful: Congress [[Raker Act|authorized the project]] after a long and bitter battle.<ref name = "int"/>

The new Secretary sought allies in Congress to implement his agenda.  One such ally was the new junior senator from [[Montana]], [[Thomas J. Walsh]], whose support was key to the passage of the Hetch Hetchy legislation.  While Walsh dissented from Lane's policies on national parks, for example by supporting local control of development in his home state's [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]], he sided with him on subjects ranging from development of Alaska to [[Bureau of Reclamation|reclamation projects]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bates|1999|pp=101<U+2013>05.}}</ref>  The Interior Secretary advocated leasing, rather than selling, public lands with possible mineral deposits, and Senator Walsh pursued legislation in this area.  While the two were successful in providing for coal land leasing in Alaska, a general minerals leasing bill would not be passed until shortly after Lane left office in 1920.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bates|1999|pp=106<U+2013>14.}}</ref>

In July 1913, Lane left on a long inspection tour of National Parks, Indian reservations, and other areas under the Interior Department's jurisdiction.  Fearful that local employees would control what he was allowed to see, he sent an assistant to visit each site and provide him with a complete report on it two weeks in advance of his arrival.  The tour was interrupted in August, when President Wilson asked his Interior Secretary to go to [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] and serve as his representative at the [[Conference of Governors (1913)|Conference of Governors]].  Lane did, and then rejoined his inspection party in San Francisco. After several days of meetings there, he collapsed due to an attack of angina pectoris.  After three weeks recuperating, he returned to Washington against medical advice to resume his work.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lane|1922|pp=139<U+2013>40.}}</ref>

As Interior Secretary, Lane was responsible for the territories, and advocated the development of [[Alaska Territory|Alaska]].  While private railroads had been established there, they were not successful, and he pushed for a government-built railroad, which he believed would lead to large-scale population movement into Alaska.<ref>{{Citation

[[File:2009 Presidential Inauguration - crowds on 18th Street NW.JPG|thumb|The new Interior Department building, now home to the GSA, as it appears today.]]
Despite his role in the Hetch Hetchy controversy, Lane was friendly towards the National Park movement, and in 1915 hired [[Stephen Mather]] to oversee the parks for which the Department was responsible.<ref name = "int"/>  Mather, a self-made millionaire and member of the [[Sierra Club]], had written Lane a bitter letter in late 1914, complaining that the national parks were being exploited for private profit.  Lane was intrigued by Mather's letter, made inquiry, and found that Mather was well thought of by Lane's friends<U+2014>and had, like Lane, attended the University of California.<ref>{{Harvnb|Albright|1999|pp=30<U+2013>32.}}</ref>  Mather's advocacy led to the establishment of the National Park Service in 1916.

In 1915, Lane returned to San Francisco to open the [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition (1915)|Panama-Pacific International Exposition]].  The President was supposed to open the fair, but was unable to attend, and sent the Interior Secretary in his place.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brechin|2006|p=245.}}</ref>  In 1916, Wilson appointed Lane to lead the American delegation and meet with the Mexican commissioners at [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] about the unstable military situation in Mexico.  These negotiations led to the withdrawal of United States troops from Mexico.<ref name = "obit"/>

The Interior Department had never had a central headquarters, but had worked from offices scattered across Washington, with the bulk of the department located in the old Patent Office building.  The Secretary lobbied for a new building for the Department, and, after Congress appropriated the funds, construction went ahead and the building was opened in early 1917.<ref>{{Harvnb|Albright|1999|pp=217<U+2013>18.}}</ref>  The structure, located at 1800 F Street N.W., now houses the [[General Services Administration]].

Mather, who would be appointed the first director of the National Park Service, began to display apparent mental illness in 1917.  His assistant, [[Horace Albright]], reported this condition to Lane.  The Secretary chose to keep Mather in his position, while allowing Albright to perform the functions of Mather's job until Mather recovered, keeping all of this secret.<ref>{{Harvnb|Albright|1999|pp=200<U+2013>02.}}</ref>  According to Albright, Lane was not a conservationist, but did not care to interfere in the decisions of his officials, and so let Mather and Albright have free rein.<ref>{{Harvnb|Albright|1999|p=335.}}</ref>  Lane wrote in 1917,
:"A wilderness, no matter how impressive and beautiful, does not satisfy this soul of mine, (if I have that kind of thing). It is a challenge to man. It says, 'Master me! Put me to use! Make me something more than I am.'"<ref>{{Harvnb|Lane|1922|p=258.}}</ref>

===World War I responsibilities===
In 1916, Wilson appointed Lane to the [[Council of National Defense]] (CND), where he urged cooperation between the private and public sectors.  He defused a difficult situation for the CND when it decided to merge its male-dominated state and local organizations with the separate Women's Committee into a unified Field Division.  Lane headed the Division, leading a board of five men and five women.<ref name = "enc"/>

Lane bitterly opposed what he saw as the President's hesitation to commit the country to war.  He wrote to his brother George in February 1917:
<blockquote> ...&nbsp;in Mexico, Cuba, Costa Rica, and Europe we have trouble. The country is growing tired of delay, and without positive leadership is losing its keenness of conscience and becoming inured to insult. Our Ambassador in Berlin is held as a hostage for days<U+2014>our Consuls' wives are stripped naked at the border, our ships are sunk, our people killed<U+2014>and yet we wait and wait! What for I do not know. Germany is winning by her bluff, for she has our ships interned in our own harbors.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lane|1922|pp=237.}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Lane was a strong advocate of preparedness in the prelude to U.S. involvement in [[World War I]].  In early 1917, he urged Wilson to authorize the arming and [[convoy]]ing of [[merchant ship|merchant vessels]].  Wilson refused, but changed his mind when informed of the [[Zimmermann Telegram]].  In a critical Cabinet meeting in March 1917, Lane, with other Cabinet members, urged American intervention in the war.<ref name = "enc">{{Harvnb|Venzon|1999|p=327.}}</ref>

With Lane's support, the nation's railroads voluntarily united to form a Railroad War Board to meet the emergency.  Lane made many effective speeches for the [[Committee on Public Information]].  The Secretary penned two brief works for the Committee, ''Why We Are Fighting Germany'' and ''The American Spirit'', which were well received and widely distributed.<ref name = "enc"/>  He urged businessmen to make "sacrifices as worthy as those of the men on their way to the trenches".<ref name = "la"/>
Lane had a love of conversation, and had some difficulty in keeping secrets.  President Wilson reportedly stopped discussing matters of importance at Cabinet meetings because the "gregarious" Lane divulged confidential matters.<ref name = "enc"/>

Lane was a supporter of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and of the [[League of Nations]].  He wrote articles urging U.S. ratification of the treaty establishing the international organization, though in vain.<ref name = "obit"/>

==Later life and legacy==
On December 17, 1919, Lane confirmed rumors that had been circulating in Washington for some months that he would be leaving the Cabinet.  Secretary Lane stated that he had not done so earlier due to President Wilson's illness.  While he gave no specific reason for his departure, ''The New York Times'' reported that Lane had found it difficult to make ends meet on a Cabinet officer's salary of $12,000 and desired to make more money for himself and his family.<ref>{{Citation

Lane resigned in February 1920, and left office at the end of the month.  He subsequently accepted employment as Vice President and legal advisor to the Mexican Petroleum Company, which was run by [[Edward Doheny]] (who, after Lane's death, would be implicated in the [[Teapot Dome scandal]]), as well as a directorship of the [[Metropolitan Life Insurance Company]].<ref name = "obit">{{Citation

}}</ref>

In a letter to Democratic Presidential candidate and [[List of Governors of Ohio|Ohio Governor]] [[James M. Cox]] in July 1920, Lane set forth his vision for America:

<blockquote>We want our unused lands put to use.  We want the farm made more attractive through better rural schools, more roads everywhere&nbsp;... We want more men with garden homes instead of tenement homes.  We want our waters, that flow idly to the sea, put to use&nbsp;... We want fewer boys and girls, men and women, who cannot read or write the language of our laws, newspapers, and literature.... The framing of our policies should not be left to emotional caprice, or the opportunism of any group of men, but should be result of sympathetic and deep studies by the wisest men we have, regardless of their politics.... We want our soldiers and sailors to be more certain of our gratitude&nbsp;... We are to extend our activities into all parts of the world.  Our trade is to grow as never before.  Our people are to resume their old place as traders on the seven seas.  We are to know other people better and make them all more and more our friends, working with them as mutually dependent factors in the growth of the world's life<ref>{{Harvnb|Lane|1922|pp=346<U+2013>49.}}</ref>
</blockquote>

By early 1921, Lane's health was failing, and he sought treatment at the [[Mayo Clinic]].  He was able to leave the Clinic and spend the remainder of the winter in warmer areas as advised by his physicians, but soon returned.  Lane's heart was in such poor condition that the Clinic could not give him general anesthesia during his heart operation.  Lane survived the operation, and wrote of the ordeal, but died soon afterward.<ref name = "obit"/>  According to his brother, George Lane, the former Secretary left no will or estate.  The vice-president of Lane's company noted that the Californian had worked 21 years for the Government on a "living salary", and the earnings from the one year of substantial wages had been heavily sapped by illness.<ref name = "la">{{Citation
