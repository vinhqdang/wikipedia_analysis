'''Frank Klepacki''' (born May 25, 1974) is an American [[musician]], [[video game music]] [[composer]] and sound director best known for his work on the [[Command & Conquer series|''Command & Conquer'' series]]. Having learned to play drums as a child, he joined [[Westwood Studios]] as a composer when he was only 17 years old. He scored several games there, including the [[Lands of Lore|''Lands of Lore'' series]], the [[Dune II|''Dune'' games]], the [[The Legend of Kyrandia|''The Legend of Kyrandia'' series]], ''[[Blade Runner (video game)|Blade Runner]]'', and the ''Command & Conquer'' series. His work in ''[[Command & Conquer: Red Alert]]'' won two awards.

He lives in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], where he has shaped a solo career and played and produced for several local bands.<ref name="lvlife">{{cite web | title=Yo, Cookie | year=2000 | month=March | url=http://www.lvlife.com/2000/03/702/story01.html | work=[http://www.lvlife.com/ Las Vegas Life] | accessdaymonth=28 August | accessyear=2006}}{{Dead link|date=October 2008}}</ref><ref name="thebittersband">{{cite web | title=The Bitters | url=http://www.thebittersband.com/ | accessdaymonth=28 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref> His personal and band work touches upon several genres, including [[orchestra]]l, [[rock music]], [[hip hop music]], [[soul music]], and [[funk]].

==Early life and career==
[[Image:Oldwestwoodstudio.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Frank Klepacki's office at the old Westwood Studios building around 1995]]

Frank Klepacki was raised by a family of musicians of [[Poles|Polish]] descent who played on the Las Vegas strip.<ref name="944magazine">{{cite web | title=Interview with Frank Klepacki | date=2006-06-30 | author=Jarret Keene | url=http://www.944.com/lasvegas/more.php?article=2808 | work=[http://www.944.com/ 944 Magazine] | accessdaymonth=27 July | accessyear=2006}}{{dead link|date=August 2007}}</ref> He drew art as a hobby, but music prevailed in his early interests.<ref name="gamingeyeinterview">{{cite web | title=Interview with Frank Klepacki | date=2003-12-21 | author=Mattias Lundin | url=http://www.gamingeye.com/pc/strategi/cc/artiklar/artikel.eye?type=interview&id=2476 | work=[http://www.gamingeye.com/ Gamingeye.com] | accessdaymonth=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> He received his first [[drumset]] at age 8 and began performing professionally by age 11.<ref name="logbookinterview">{{cite web | title=Interview with Frank Klepacki | year=2001 | author=Earl Green | url=http://www.thelogbook.com/music/i_frank.htm | work=[http://www.thelogbook.com/ The Logbook] | accessdaymonth=28 July | accessyear=2006}}{{Dead link|date=October 2008}}</ref> Among his early influences were [[electronica]] bands and [[Heavy metal music|Heavy Metal]] groups, including [[Depeche Mode]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]], [[AC/DC]], and [[Iron Maiden]].<ref name="morphscape">{{cite web | title=COMMENTARY: What is a Morphscape? | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/ | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com/ frankklepacki.com] | accessdaymonth=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Seeking to master [[guitar]], [[bass guitar|bass]], and [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s, he formed local bands and created a [[demo tape]] of original material by age 17. His impetus for diversifying his instrumental abilities was "not being able to communicate with other band members on ideas...for original songs."<ref name="twistedinterview">{{cite web | title=The Frank Klepacki Interview | date=2007-04-02 | author=Banxy | url=http://www.twistedoutlook.com/frankklepackiinterview.php | work=[http://www.twistedoutlook.com/ Twisted Outlook] | accessdaymonth=22 April | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

After learning to program [[BASIC]] on a [[Tandy 1000]] and becoming interested in [[Video game|computer and video games]], he applied for a job as a [[game tester]] at Westwood studios.<ref name="logbookinterview" /> He submitted his demo tape<U+2014>described as "an acoustic guitar song with electric guitar leads and keyboard strings, and raining sound effects"<U+2014>to the company's audio director.<ref name="gameplaymag">{{cite journal | last = Klepacki | first = Frank | title = Interview with Frank Klepacki | month=October | year=2007 | journal = [[Gameplay magazine]] | publisher = ITC Publishing}}</ref><ref name="944magazine" /> The growing company enlisted him as a composer for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] port of ''[[DragonStrike (computer game)|DragonStrike]]'' and the computer game ''[[Eye of the Beholder (computer game)|Eye of the Beholder II]]''.<ref name="944magazine" /> He later composed with [[MIDI]] sequencing for several other ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' games.<ref name="behindcc">{{cite web | title=COMMENTARY: Behind the C&C Soundtrack | author=Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/ | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com/ frankklepacki.com] | accessdaymonth=27 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> In 1992, he helmed the audio of ''[[Dune II]]'', attempting to complement the music of the original ''[[Dune (computer game)|Dune]]''.<ref name="avaultinterview">{{cite web | date=2006-09-17 | title=Good to the Last Note | author=Josh Horowitz | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20041106032042/www.avault.com/articles/getarticle.asp?name=lastnote&page=4 | work=[http://www.avault.com/ Adrenaline Vault] | accessdaymonth=27 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> He later noted that he pushed the sequencing program on his [[Amiga]] to the limit while scoring the game.<ref name="gwjinterview">{{cite web | date= 2006-03-21 | title=Gamers With Jobs Radio: Interview with Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/taxonomy/term/318 | work=[http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/ Gamers with Jobs] | accessdaymonth=22 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref> While working on ''[[The Lion King#Video games|Disney's The Lion King]]'' in 1994, he and the Westwood team were shown sketches of the unfinished feature film.<ref name="interviewfaq">{{cite web | title=Interview FAQ | author=Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/ | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com/ frankklepacki.com] | accessdaymonth=27 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Film composer [[Hans Zimmer]] later praised Klepacki for reworking his scores.<ref name="music4gamesinterview">{{cite web | date=2006-01-22 | title=Interview with Star Wars: Empire At War Audio Director and composer Frank Klepacki | author=Music4Games staff | url=http://www.music4games.net/Features_Display.aspx?id=6 | work=[http://www.music4games.net/ Music4Games] | accessdaymonth=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> After finishing ''[[The Legend of Kyrandia|The Legend of Kyrandia III]]'', Frank Klepacki met with Westwood leaders to discuss the upcoming game ''[[Command & Conquer]]''<U+2014>the first in a series which would bring him wider fame and critical acclaim.<ref name="behindcc" />

===Command and Conquer series===
In 1994, Frank Klepacki met with Westwood Studios developers to discuss the soundtrack of the company's next project<U+2014>''Command & Conquer''. To define the game's style, Klepacki listened to a number of bands, including [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]]<ref name="behindcc" /><ref name="twistedinterview" />, which would supply the iconic [[industrial]] style found in the majority of the songs. He combined various elements of this music and added his own touch to create a unique sound. With the company's recent shift to 22 [[Hertz|kHz]] audio, Klepacki composed with an ASR-10 sampler, a [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] S760 sampler, a Roland JD 990 synth module, and an [[electric guitar]].<ref name="behindcc" /> The first few songs he composed for ''Command & Conquer'' contained voice samples<U+2014>including the notable pieces ''Act on Instinct'' and ''No Mercy'' (which featured wild declarations from ''[[Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey]]''). The samples were later found to interfere with the game's spoken audio, and were replaced with versions lacking the voices, although the original versions (and several other unused pieces) can still be found on the DOS ''C&C'' and ''Covert Operations'' discs. Complete versions of the songs later appeared on the game's commercial soundtrack.<ref name="behindcc" /> He would continue to sample clips from film and other media throughout his career, using a quote from ''[[The Brain from Planet Arous]]'' in the ''Yuri'' song ''Brainfreeze'', for example. Klepacki next composed instrumental pieces for ''Command & Conquer'', drawing influences from  [[orchestra]]l, [[house music|house]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and [[hip hop music]]. For the [[Credit (creative arts)|credits]], Klepacki wrote ''Airstrike'', featuring a hook later used in ''[[Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun]]'' for the [[Global Defense Initiative]]. Conversely, the [[Brotherhood of Nod]] ending used the song ''Destructible Times'' written by Klepacki's local band, [[I AM]]. Developers requested the song because it "reflected the war aspect and bad-ass vibe of Nod's side."<ref name="behindcc" /> The ''C&C'' expansion pack ''The Covert Operations'' featured seven new [[ambient music|ambient]] pieces, all of which were also included on the disc in high quality [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|CD Audio]] format.<ref name="behindcc" /> Though the soundtrack was not released through retail, Westwood sold it by special order through its website and in game catalogues.<ref name="westwoodcatalogue">{{Cite book | year=2000 | author=Westwood Studios | title=The Westwood Studios Catalog | publisher=Westwood Studios | language=English}}</ref>

[[Image:Klepackicameo.png|left|thumb|320px|Frank Klepacki and [[Joseph D. Kucan]] in a ''[[Command & Conquer: Red Alert|Red Alert]]'' cut scene]]

While working on ''Covert Operations'', Frank Klepacki composed ''Hell March''. Upon listening, director [[Brett Sperry]] insisted this song be used as the signature theme of ''Command & Conquer: Red Alert.''<ref name="behindcc" /> Originally intended for use with the Brotherhood of Nod, it features militaristic samples<U+2014>including marching, industrial sounds, and a commander shouting what sounded like "We want war, wake up!"<U+2014>but actually a German drill instructor shouting "Die Waffen &ndash; legt an!", roughly translated as "Ready weapons!". Klepacki initially scored ''Red Alert'' with sci-fi camp in mind, but early songs were shelved. He switched gears to write gritty pieces, prompting the ''Red Alert'' team to expand upon the style of ''Command & Conquer''.<ref name="behindra">{{cite web | title=COMMENTARY: Behind the Red Alert Soundtrack | author=Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/ | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com/ frankklepacki.com] | accessdate=27 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> In preparing to compose, Klepacki acquired new sample libraries for unique and strange sounds. Particular creative moods would result in a few songs at a time. He first wrote heavy songs like ''Workmen'' and ''Crush'', then composed neutral, synthesizer-laden music, such as ''Vector'' and ''Roll Out''. Klepacki scored ''Fogger'' and ''Mud'', one of his personal favorites, before finishing with ''Militant Force'' and ''Radio 2''. He took breaks from working to make cameo appearances as a Soviet soldier killed by [[Joseph D. Kucan]] and an Allied commander in the [[cut scene]]s of ''Red Alert''. He previously appeared as a [[Brotherhood of Nod|Nod]] soldier and the voice of the commando in ''Command & Conquer'' and would voice bit parts in future Westwood games.<ref name="actingcameos">{{cite web | title=COMMENTARY: Frank's acting cameos | author=Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/ | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com/ frankklepacki.com] | accessdaymonth=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

After completing ''Red Alert'', he took a short break to review his work. He concluded that some songs could be enhanced, but ''Red Alert'' had already gone [[Development stage#Gold.2Fgeneral availability release|gold]], precluding new versions.<ref name="behindra" /> These remixes later appeared on the unsuccessful ''Command & Conquer: Sole Survivor''. ''Red Alert''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s soundtrack was voted best video game soundtrack of 1996 by ''[[PC Gamer]]'' and ''Gameslice ''magazines, defeating [[Trent Reznor]]'s score for ''[[Quake]]''.<ref name="behindra" /><ref name="music4gamesinterview" /> Reviewers called it "fun to listen to" and "second to none."<ref name="gamespotredalert">{{cite web | author=Vince Broady | date=1996-11-26 | title=Review of Red Alert | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/commandconquerredalert/review.html | work=[http://www.gamespot.com/ GameSpot] | accessdaymonth=23 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="darkzeroredalert">{{cite web | date=2002-12-29 | title=Review of Red Alert | url=http://darkzero.co.uk/v4/games/review/12 | work=[http://wwww.darkzero.co.uk/ DarkZero] | accessdaymonth=23 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref> As of 2005, ''Red Alert'' was listed in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' for selling several million units, bringing Klepacki his widest audience.<ref name="guinness">{{Cite book | year=2005 | editor=Claire Folkard | title=The Guinness Book of World Records | publisher=Bantam Books | language=English | id=0553588109 }}</ref> He wrote additional music for the game's [[expansion pack]]s, ''Counterstrike'' and ''Aftermath''.

==Later Westwood games==
[[Image:Klepacki WW Office.JPG|right|thumb|230px|Frank Klepacki's last office at Westwood]]
In 1997, Frank Klepacki scored a ''[[Blade Runner]]'' adaptation and in 1998 composed for ''[[Dune 2000]]''. He attempted to update the music from ''[[Dune II]]'' into "this non-blip stuff."<ref name="avaultinterview" /> ''Dune 2000'' was panned by critics, though Klepacki's score was praised for adhering to the traditional ''Dune'' style.<ref name="gamespotdune2000">{{cite web | author=Ron Dulin | date=1997-12-03 | title=Review of Dune 2000 | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/adventure/bladerunner/review.html | work=[http://www.gamespot.com/ GameSpot] | accessdaymonth=23 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref> He composed for ''[[Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun]]'' with [[Jarrid Mendelson]]<U+2014>with whom he would later collaborate on ''[[Emperor: Battle for Dune]]''.<ref name="videogamesheet" /> He began by writing ''Stomp'', an energetic rock piece intended to recreate the effect of ''Hell March'' for the new game.<ref name="tscommentary">{{cite web | author=Frank Klepacki | date=2007-05-15 | title=COMMENTARY: Tiberian Sun | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/ | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com/ FrankKlepacki.com] | accessdaymonth=4 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Coincidentally, one of the trailers for Command and Conquer 3 featured 'Stomp' as the soundtrack. Westwood instead wanted ''Tiberian Sun'' to feature darker, more moody music, and ''Stomp'' was shelved in favor of the current sound. Bereft of ideas due to the stark change in direction, Klepacki asked Mendelson to collaborate; he regards tracks they both worked on as the best. ''Tiberian Sun'' ultimately featured dark, ambient [[techno music]] and ambient space music suited to the game's post-apocalyptic and futuristic setting.<ref name="tsreview">{{cite web | title=Review of Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun | author=The Logbook staff | url=http://www.thelogbook.com/music/command-and-conquer-tiberian-sun/ | work=[http://www.thelogbook.com/ The Logbook] | accessdaymonth=28 July | accessyear=2006}}{{Dead link|date=October 2008}}</ref> Klepacki cited the piece "Mad Rap" as his favorite. An avid ''[[Star Wars]]'' fan, he enjoyed scoring [[cut scenes]] featuring [[James Earl Jones]], the voice of [[Darth Vader]].<ref name="petroglyphpodcast" /> The scenes also allowed him to integrate the ''Airstrike'' and ''No Mercy'' themes into the game's score despite the aforementioned shift.<ref name="tscommentary" /> With the expansion pack ''Firestorm'', he attempted to "set things right" by writing more upbeat songs and including ''Stomp'', which would also appear in ''Command & Conquer: Renegade''.<ref name="tscommentary"/> He next scored ''[[Lands of Lore]] III'' and ''[[Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2]]''. Klepacki defined ''Red Alert 2''{{'}}s style with heavy metal guitar and fast-paced beats.<ref name="ra2review">{{cite web | title=Review of Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 | author=The Logbook staff | url=http://www.thelogbook.com/pixel/command-conquer-red-alert/ | work=[http://www.thelogbook.com/ The Logbook] | accessdaymonth=28 July | accessyear=2006}}{{Dead link|date=October 2008}}</ref> Klepacki scored the game with a [[Korg]] Tr-rack, [[Novation]], and [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] 5080.<ref name="westwoodnetinterview">{{cite web | year=2001 | title=Frank Klepacki Interview (Yuri's Revenge) | url=http://www.westwoodi.net/read.php?Articles/Frank_Klepacki_Interview | work=[http://www.westwoodi.net/ Westwood Infiltration] | accessdaymonth=28 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref> ''Red Alert 2''<nowiki></nowiki> included a remix of "Hell March". The return to high-energy songs was owed in part to fan criticism of ''Tiberian Sun''.<ref name="avaultinterview" />

Klepacki maintained the energetic style in ''Red Alert 2''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s expansion pack ''Yuri's Revenge''. For ''[[Command & Conquer: Renegade]]''<U+2014>the next entry in the series<U+2014>Klepacki tried to update the style of the original ''Command & Conquer'' by making it "hipper and more elaborate."<ref name="avaultinterview" /> Several ''Command & Conquer'' mainstays appear as reworked versions, including ''Target (Mechanical Man)'', ''Industrial'', ''Act on Instinct'', and ''No Mercy''. The main theme's melody comes from ''C&C 80's Mix'', a piece composed for ''Covert Operations'' but scrapped before release.<ref name="ra2review">{{cite web | title=Music / Track List / Info | author=Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/ | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com/ frankklepacki.com] | accessdaymonth=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Klepacki's last contribution to [[Westwood Studios]] was the music of ''[[Earth & Beyond]]'', comprising four albums of material.<ref name="music4gamesinterview3">{{cite web | year=2002 | title=Interview with Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.music4games.net/n_earth&beyond.html | work=[http://www.music4games.net/ Music4Games] | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030224064701/http://www.music4games.net/n_earth&beyond.html | archivedate=2003-02-04 | accessdaymonth=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Acquired by [[Electronic Arts]] in 1998, Westwood was liquidated in 2002 and the remaining employees were relocated to [[EA Los Angeles]].<ref name="mobygames">{{cite web | title=History for Westwood Studios | url=http://www.mobygames.com/company/westwood-studios-inc/history | work=[http://www.mobygames.com/ MobyGames] | accessdaymonth=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Several Westwood founders left the company. Though Frank Klepacki offered to score ''[[Command & Conquer: Generals]]'' and submitted a demo to EA, he was not contacted to compose.<ref name="interviewfaq" /> When asked in 2002 whether he'd continue scoring music after ten years in the business, he exclaimed, "ten down, next ten to go!"<ref name="westwoodnetinterview" /> After Westwood's closure, he reflected on his past work at a dinner held by Joseph Kucan and other former employees.<ref name="dinner">{{cite web | title=Frank and Joe at Dinner | author=Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.gamereplays.org/community/index.php?showtopic=96709 | work=[http://www.gamereplays.org/ Gamereplays.org] | accessdaymonth=8 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref> However, Frank recently confirmed his involvement in the development of the soundtrack for ''[[Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3]]'', including an updated version of his iconic Hell March, now known as "Hell March 3."

==Petroglyph games==
Klepacki took a brief hiatus to work on solo albums, then joined [[Petroglyph (game studio)|Petroglyph]] games as full-time audio director in 2004.<ref name="petroglyphpodcast" /> He prepared by becoming versed in the job's requirements and demands.<ref name="petroglyphpodcast" /> His first task was scoring ''[[Star Wars: Empire at War]]'', Petroglyph's launch title; he also helped select voice actors.<ref name="askpetroglyph1">{{cite web | title=Some questions for everyone at Petroglyph | url=http://www.petroglyphgames.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=1012&hl=klepacki | work=[http://www.petroglyphgames.com/forums/ Petroglyph Forums] | accessdaymonth=2 January | accessyear=2007}}</ref> A die-hard fan of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise, Klepacki enjoyed complementing [[John Williams]]'s style as he worked with sound effects used in the feature films.<ref name="music4gamesinterview" /> He worked closely with programmers to ensure perfect aural functionality. Though most the game's score is John Williams's work, Klepacki estimates that he contributed 20% original material. Apart from the main theme, he aimed to minimize his editing in order to retain the classic ''Star Wars'' sound.<ref name="music4gamesinterview" /> He chiefly composed for new areas of the ''Star Wars'' universe only found in ''Empire at War''. He calls his work on the game "the peak of my career,"<ref name="petroglyphpodcast" /> and felt he had spent his entire life grooming his abilities for that soundtrack.<ref name="gwjinterview" /> As a perk of composing, he visited [[Skywalker Ranch]] and [[Industrial Light and Magic]], and took pride in having his name associated with an official ''Star Wars'' product.<ref name="twincities">{{cite web | title=Fans share their Star Wars memories | author=Pioneer Press | date=2007-05-23 | url=http://www.twincities.com/searchresults/ci_5959685?nclick_check=1 | work=[http://www.twincities.com/ Twin Cities] | accessdaymonth=4 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref><ref name="readerswrite">{{cite web | title=The Readers Write: 'Star Wars' memories | date=2007-05-25 | url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07133/785788-254.stm | work=[http://www.post-gazette.com/ Pittsburgh Post-Gazette] | accessdaymonth=4 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

For the ''Forces of Corruption'' expansion pack, he took greater creative liberty with the ''Star Wars'' feel by writing an original theme for the new criminal faction.<ref name="petroglyphpodcast" /> In attempting to compose this piece, he wrote several preliminary hooks that were later integrated into the game's battle themes.<ref name="gamespotdiary5">{{cite web | title=Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption Designer Diary #5 - The Sounds of Corruption | date=2006-10-17 | author=Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/starwarsempireatwarforces/news.html?sid=6159916 | work=[http://www.gamespot.com/ GameSpot] | accessdaymonth=2 January | accessyear=2007}}</ref> He composed six pieces for the expansion total, including the finale theme.

Klepacki's next project was a game collaboration by [[SEGA]] and Petroglyph named ''[[Universe at War: Earth Assault]]''.<ref name="gwjinterview" /> As of December 2006, he had composed several songs for various factions and enjoyed the "opportunity to create something new again, not based on...existing intellectual property.<ref name="petropo2">{{cite web | date=2006-12-06 | title=Frank's Music for P-02 | url=

He declared that surprises were in store for ''Command & Conquer'' fans waiting for him to return to his "roots" and "adrenaline-pumping soundtrack style", and suggested that they "imagine my mindset...when Command & Conquer first came out, and add about fifteen years experience to that."<ref name="gamespotuaw" /><ref name="pgvideointerview" /> Klepacki summarized the game's main styles shortly before release:

{{cquote2|For the Hierarchy<U+2014>our evil alien race<U+2014>--I went with a more heavy-metal rock influence, to go along with how they stomp all over everything on the map with their massive walker units. Novus<U+2014>--our high-tech, hit-and-run faction<U+2014>--featured more industrial electronica to go along with their futuristic robotic feel. For our third faction, the Masari<U+2014>--our ancient star-faring side--I provided an epic orchestral feel, with worldly influences to reflect their godlike nature and questionable links to our past. One Masari track in particular, "Divine Intervention," would become the central theme to the whole game.<ref name="gamespotuaw" />}}

As audio director, Klepacki also created many sound effects for ''Universe at War''. For the alien Hierarchy, he cultivated an "unnatural" aesthetic through an "arsenal of mangled noises".<ref name="gamespotuaw" /> Klepacki used a "combination of heavy cranes recorded with overdriven impacts" to give the faction's walkers a "menacing machinelike breathing sound", and made up his own language to record "various grunts, growls, mannerisms, and strange vocalizations.<ref name="gamespotuaw" /> Since Hierarchy heroes needed to communicate to the player in English, Klepacki engineered dialogue to seem as if the aliens were "telepathically speaking to you, with a back-masking effect on their voices...as if the words are being channeled straight to your brain".<ref name="gamespotuaw" /> The Novus effects were usually [[Phaser (effect)|phased]] and involved "mechanical movement, electricity, and metal sounds". He invented yet another language for two characters Viktor and Mirabel, who occasionally speak to one another. Lastly, he drew on weather and other natural sounds for the Masari, describing their ambience as having "more weight, thunder, heavy bass rumblings, vortex gusts..."<ref name="gamespotuaw" /> Klepacki directed the voice-acting to have a "noble and strong" feel without appearing typically medieval or overly dramatic.<ref name="gamespotuaw" />

Frank Klepacki's solo work debuted in 2002 with ''[[Morphscape]]''. Production began in 1996 with the song ''Cybertek'', though an album was not planned at this time. The rest of ''Morphscape''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s songs were composed after ''Red Alert 2''. Klepacki composed the album's title track while working on ''Command & Conquer: Renegade'', and feels the game's style is visibly present in ''Morphscape''.<ref name="morphscape" /> Klepacki released the final product after Westwood's dissolution. His biggest inspiration in creating solo works is the legion of fans interested in ''Command & Conquer''.<ref name="music4gamesinterview2">{{cite web | author=Jay Semerad | year=2002 | title=Interview with Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.music4games.net/f_frankklepacki_morphscape.html | work=[http://www.music4games.net/ Music4Games] | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20031227123848/http://www.music4games.net/f_frankklepacki_morphscape.html | archivedate=2003-12-27 | accessdaymonth=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Klepacki took a hiatus from composing video game music to write two other solo albums, the first of which is entitled ''[[Rocktronic]]''. Released in 2004, the album was described as dark, edgy, and heavy in a way that will appeal to ''Command & Conquer'' fans.<ref name="personalprojects">{{cite web | title=Personal Projects | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/ | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com/ frankklepacki] | accessdaymonth=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Klepacki sought out specific samples and instruments used in the Command & Conquer soundtrack for use in the release; the title "Rocktronic" was an attempt to name his style of music.<ref name="creatingrock" /> Featuring live drumming in certain songs, the album is Klepacki's best-seller. Following ''Rocktronic'' was ''[[Virtual Control]]'', released in 2005. Klepacki complemented his usual style with experiments in hip hop on the album. Tracks from each release have been periodically used in ''[[The Ultimate Fighter]]'', along with certain custom themes written for the show.<ref name="personalprojects" /><ref name="twistedinterview" />

On August 1, 2006, he revealed his next solo project would be named ''[[Awakening of Aggression]]'' and confirmed the music would be "heavy" and "hard-hitting."<ref name="klepackinews" /> When interviewed, Klepacki said that he channeled stress into the heavy music of the new album.<ref name="music4gamesfoc" /> ''Aggression'' was released in October of the same year, and was made available on [[iTunes]] on December 7.

==Work and beliefs==
When composing for video games, Frank Klepacki spends a few days to compose and master one song on average.<ref name="imperiuminterview">{{cite web | title=Interview with Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.imperium-ww.pl/articles.php?article_id=30 | work=[http://www.imperium-ww.pl/ Imperium Westwood] | accessdaymonth=28 August | accessyear=2006}}{{Dead link|date=October 2008}}</ref> He feels writing music for games is somewhat difficult as only early [[software build]]s are available to play; he sometimes must compose songs based on vague descriptions.<ref name="westwoodnetinterview" /> Composing for cut scenes is easier by comparison.<ref name="westwoodnetinterview" /> Nonetheless, he prefers to compose for a game throughout its development rather than write songs for a finished product.<ref name="petropo2" /> He feels that game music has been harder to compose than film or solo music as he must compose for all situations a player may discover or engineer.<ref name="gameplaymag" /> Klepacki maintains templates with a base of common instruments prepared for sudden bursts of inspiration, as he resents "having technical issues...as an obstacle."<ref name="gameplaymag" /> When asked how the composing process begins, Klepacki related:

{{cquote2|It starts with knowing what I'm composing for. Is it a battle theme, or main title, or ambient theme, etc. Then I figure out what type of mood or style best fits...the subject matter. From there it's about picking the right instrumentation and then the writing process starts. It could start with anything; a guitar riff, a French horn melody, a drum rhythm or bass line. Then I keep alternating instruments track by track recording one part at a time until I have something that sounds full and gets the point across I'm trying for.<ref name="gameplaymag" />}}

Klepacki has said that the most rewarding part of composing video game music is working with a team<U+2014>which he compares to chemistry between band members<U+2014>and knowing he is part of a greater cause.<ref name="petroglyphpodcast" /> He believes that game music could improve if artists focused on quality and derived inspiration from playing games.<ref name="music4gamesinterview" /> He has expressed interest in having Electronic Arts sell his soundtracks in retail stores, preferably next to video games in electronic departments.<ref name="music4gamesinterview4">{{cite web | title=Video Game Soundtrack Report 1.0 | url=http://www.music4games.net/f_soundtracks_report_1.html | work=[http://www.music4games.net/ Music4Games] | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021107110623/http://www.music4games.net/f_soundtracks_report_1.html | archivedate=2002-11-07 | accessdaymonth=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> He advises those wishing to get in the video game business to attend conventions and investigate developer companies.<ref name="petroglyphpodcast" /> Klepacki is happy to see older games offered on the [[Wii]], hoping that gamers are "recognizing once again that simple, short fun experiences are just as good as...long, huge-production experiences."<ref name="gameplaymag" />

He notes that complex and quality music comes at a higher cost, prompting certain producers to simply "get somebody who could cop the Hollywood sound" instead of nurturing original style.<ref name="gwjinterview" /> When asked about his career low-point, he named ''[[Order of the Griffon]]'' for the [[TurboGrafx-16]], citing difficulties with the system's limited musical capabilities.<ref name="gwjinterview" /> Concerning his solo career and Westwood, Klepacki regrets "not having attended more of the fun company functions and parties while I was instead playing club gigs with bands with the mentality of trying to get signed or discovered."<ref name="gameplaymag" /> When asked to reflect on his career, he replied:

{{cquote2|The ironic thing is that my original goal in life was to be in a famous band, tour the world and sell millions of albums. Although that didn't quite happen, I got something else just as gratifying. Instead of being in a famous band, I gained some fame in the industry as a game composer. Instead of touring the world, I receive fan mail from around the world. Instead of selling millions of albums, my music is on millions of games! And I sell enough of my own albums that allows me to keep releasing them. So in a different way, I kind of got what I wanted after all. And I'm more than happy with that. The most fulfilling part of it is that I feel I contributed something that mattered to a significant number of people, and more importantly, I got to be a part of projects that mattered a lot to my life personally, like Star Wars!<ref name="gameplaymag" />}}

Klepacki is not seeking a record deal, citing a "horrible chain of steps to getting famous." Scathingly critical of the [[recording industry]], he blames [[MTV]]<U+2014>described as a "teenage
