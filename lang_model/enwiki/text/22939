'''Providence''' is the [[capital]] and the most populous city of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Rhode Island]], and one of the first cities established in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Northeast/Providence-Introduction.html|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|title=Providence: Introduction|accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref> Located in [[Providence County, Rhode Island|Providence County]], it is the second-largest city in the [[New England]] region. Despite having an estimated population of 176,862 as of 2005, it anchors the [[List of United States metropolitan areas|35th]] [[Providence metropolitan area|largest metropolitan population]] in the country, with an estimated [[metropolitan statistical areas|MSA]] population of 1,622,520, exceeding that of Rhode Island by about 60% due to its reaching into southern [[Massachusetts]].<ref name=metro>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/Estimates%20pages_final.html U.S Census Bureau|title=[[July 1]] [[2005]] Population Estimates|accessdate = 2007-03-22|publisher=US Census Bureau}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.bls.gov/oes/current/msa_def.htm#77200 stats.bls.gov|publisher=US Department of Labor|title = May 2006 OEC Metropolitan Statistical Area definitions|accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref>  Situated at the mouth of the [[Providence River]], on [[Narragansett Bay]], the city's small footprint is crisscrossed by seemingly erratic streets and a rapidly changing demographic using them.

Providence was founded by [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]], a religious exile from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. He named the area in honor of "God's merciful Providence" which he believed was responsible for his finding such a haven to settle. After being one of the first cities in the country to industrialize, Providence became noted for its [[jewelry]] and [[Silver (household)|silverware]] industry.  Today, Providence city proper alone is home to eight hospitals and seven institutions of higher learning, which has shifted the former's economy into service industries, though it still retains significant manufacturing work. The city was once nicknamed the "Beehive of Industry", while today "The Renaissance City" is more common, though as of 2000 census, its poverty rate was still among the ten highest for cities over 100,000.<ref name=poverty>{{cite web | url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-19.pdf | format=PDF| title=Poverty 1999 - U.S. Census Brief 2000| author=Bishaw, Alemayehu, and John Iceland | publisher=US Census Bureau | year=May 2003 | accessdate = 2007-01-17}}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of Providence}}
The area which is now Providence was first settled in June 1636 by [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]], and was one of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]] of the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/565/000050415/ nndb.com|publisher=Soylent Communications|title = Roger Williams|accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref> Williams secured a title from the [[Narragansett (tribe)|Narragansett]] natives around this time and gave the city its present name. Williams also cultivated Providence as a refuge for persecuted religious dissenters, as he himself had been exiled from [[Massachusetts]].<ref name="3.5-centuries">{{cite web | url=http://www.providenceri.com/history/centuries1.html | title=Three and One-Half Centuries at a Glance | publisher=City of Providence, Rhode Island | date=May 2002 | accessdate = 2006-01-17}}</ref> Providence's growth would be slow during the next quarter-century &mdash; the subsuming of its territory into surrounding towns, difficulty of farming the land, and differing of local traditions and land conflicts all slowed development.<ref name="3.5-centuries"/> 

[[Image:Providence old.JPG|thumb|left|Providence in the mid-20th century]]
In the mid-1770s, the British government levied taxes that impeded Providence's maritime, fishing and agricultural industries, the mainstay of the city's economy.  One example was the [[Sugar Act]], which impacted Providence's distilleries and its trade in rum and slaves. These taxes caused Providence to join the other colonies in renouncing allegiance to the British Crown.In response to enforcement of unpopular trade laws, Providence residents spilled the first blood of the American Revolution in the notorious [[Gasp<U+00E9>e Affair]] of 1772.<ref name="3.5-centuries"/>

Though during the [[Revolutionary War]] the city escaped enemy occupation, the capture of nearby [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] disrupted industry and kept the population on alert. Troops were quartered for various campaigns and [[Brown University]]'s University Hall was used as a barracks and military hospital.<ref name="3.5-centuries"/>

[[Image:Woonasquatucket River.jpg|thumb|A historic mill on the [[Woonasquatucket River]]]]
Following the war, the economy shifted from maritime endeavors to manufacturing, particularly machinery, tools, silverware, jewelry and textiles. At one time, Providence boasted some of the [[History of Providence|largest manufacturing plants in the country]] including Brown & Sharpe, Nicholson File, and Gorham Silverware.<ref name="3.5-centuries"/>  The city's industries attracted many immigrants from Ireland, Germany, Sweden, England, Italy, Portugal, Cape Verde, and French Canada. Economic and demographic shifts caused social strife, notably with a series of race riots between whites and blacks during the 1820s. In response to these troubles and the economic growth, Providence residents ratified a city charter in 1831.<ref name="3.5-centuries"/>

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], local politics split over slavery as many had ties to Southern cotton. Despite ambivalence concerning the war, the number of military volunteers routinely exceeded quota, and the city's manufacturing proved invaluable to the Union. Providence thrived postwar, waves of immigrants and land annexations brought the population from 54,595 in 1865 to 175,597 by 1900.<ref name="3.5-centuries"/>

The city began to see a decline by the mid-1920s as industries, notably textiles, shut down. The [[Great Depression]] hit the city hard, and Providence's downtown was flooded by the [[New England Hurricane of 1938]] soon after. The city saw further decline as a result of the nation-wide trends, with the construction of highways and increased suburbanization.<ref name="3.5-centuries"/> From the 1950s to the 1980s, Providence was a notorious bastion of [[organized crime]].<ref name=mob>{{cite web | author=May, Allan | url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/family_epics/providence_mob/1.html | title=All About the Providence Mob | publisher=Court TV Crime Library | date=2007 | accessdate = 2007-01-24}}</ref> The legendary mafia boss [[Raymond Patriarca]] ruled a vast criminal enterprise from the city for over three decades, during which murders and kidnapings would become commonplace.<ref name=mob/>

[[Image:Providenceconstruction.JPG|thumb|left|New construction in Providence (August 2006): cranes seen for [[Waterplace|Waterplace Condominium]] towers, Westin addition, and the [[GTECH]] headquarters prior to completion]]
The city's eponymous "Renaissance" began in the 1970s. From 1975 until 1982, [[United States dollar|$]]606 million of local and national Community Development funds from  were invested throughout the city, and the hitherto falling population began to stabilize. In the 1990s, Mayor [[Vincent Cianci, Jr]] showcased the city's strength in arts and pushed for further revitalization, ultimately resulting in the opening up of the city's natural rivers (which had been paved over), relocation of a large section of railroad underground, creation of [[Waterplace Park]] and river walks along the river's banks, and construction of the Fleet Skating Rink (now the Bank of America Skating Rink) in downtown and the 1.4 million ft<sup>2</sup> [[Providence Place]] Mall.<ref name="3.5-centuries"/>  

New investment triggered within the city, with [[Current and Recent Construction Projects in Providence|new construction]] including numerous condo projects, hotels, and a new office highrise all filling in the freed space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/news/content/c22_05-22-07_AU5NOR8.35ee4a9.html projo.com|title = Condo supplies risings as prices drop|author=Lynn Arditi|publisher=Providence Journal|accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/news/content/hotl13_05-13-07_B35KBM0.370f07e.html projo.com|publisher=Providence Journal|title = Hunger for Hotels|author= Daniel Barbarisi|accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref>  Despite new investment, poverty remains an entrenched problem as it does in most [[post-industrial]] New England cities.

==Geography==
[[Image:Provneighlabel.JPG|right|thumb|Providence neighborhoods with major highways shown]]
The Providence city limits enclose a small geographic region, with a total area of 53.2 [[square kilometre|km<U+00B2>]] (20.5 [[square mile|mi<U+00B2>]]). 47.8 km<U+00B2> (18.5 mi<U+00B2>) of it is land and the remaining 5.3 km<U+00B2> (2.1 mi<U+00B2>) (roughly 10%) of it is water.

Providence is located at the head of [[Narragansett Bay]], with the [[Providence River]] running into the bay through the center of the city,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Northeast/Providence-Geography-and-Climate.html |publisher=Advameg, Inc.|title=Providence: Geography and Climate|accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref> formed by the confluence of the [[Moshassuck River|Moshassuck]] and [[Woonasquatucket River|Woonasquatucket]] Rivers.  The Waterplace Park amphitheater and riverwalks line the river's banks through downtown. Constitution Hill (near downtown), College (or Prospect) Hill (east of the Providence River), and Federal Hill (west of downtown and is New England's largest Italian district) are the most prominent of the city's hills. The remaining hills include Tockwotten Hill at [[Fox Point, Providence, Rhode Island|Fox Point]], Smith Hill (where the State House is located), Christian Hill at Hoyle Square (junction of Cranston & Westminster Streets), and Weybosset Hill at the lower end of Weybosset Street, which was leveled in the early 1880s.

===Cityscape===
[[Image:Westminsterstreet.JPG|thumb|Perspective of Westminster Street]]
The city of Providence is geographically very compact, characteristic of [[eastern seaboard]] cities which developed prior to use of the automobile. For this reason, Providence has the [[List of U.S. cities with most pedestrian commuters|eighth-highest percentage]] of pedestrian commuters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bikesatwork.com/carfree/census-lookup.php?state_select=*&lower_pop=50000&upper_pop=250000&sort_num=2&show_rows=25&first_row=0 bikesatwork.com|publisher=Bikes At Work Inc.|title=Carfree Database Results|accessdate=2007-06-05}} Out of cities over 100,000 in population</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bikesatwork.com/carfree/census-lookup.php?state_select=*&lower_pop=250000&upper_pop=999999999&sort_num=2&show_rows=25&first_row=0 bikesatwork.com|publisher=Bikes At Work Inc.|title=Carfree Database Results|accessdate=2007-06-05}} Out of cities over 100,000 in population</ref> The street layout is somewhat chaotic &mdash; over one thousand streets (a great number for the city's size) run haphazardly, connecting and radiating from traditionally bustling places like Market Square.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~rigenweb/article271.html rootsweb.com|publisher=USGenWeb Project|author=Albert J. Wright|title=History of the State of Rhode Island with Illustrations|author=Albert J. Wright|accessdate=2007-06-06}}</ref>  

Downtown Providence is known locally as "Downcity", and many 19th century mercantile buildings in the [[Federal style architecture|Federal]] and Victorian architectural styles, as well as several post-modern and modernist buildings, are located throughout this area. In particular, a fairly clear spatial separation appears between the areas of pre-1980s development and post-1980s development. Fountain Street and Exchange Terrace serve as rough boundaries between the two.  

The newer area includes [[Providence Place Mall]] (1999), a [[The Westin Providence|Westin hotel]] (1993), [[GTECH]] (2006), new condominium construction, and [[Waterplace Park]] (1994); the area tends toward newer development since much of it is land reclaimed in the 1970s from a mass of railroad tracks which was referred to colloquially as the "Chinese Wall".<ref>{{cite book |last=Woodward |first=William McKenzie |title=PPS/AIAri Guide to Providence Architecture |year=2003 |publisher=Providence Preservation Society |location=Providence, RI |isbn=0-9742847-0-X |pages=13 }}</ref> This part of Downcity is characterized by open spaces, wide roads, and intent landscaping.

[[Image:Picture 270.jpg|thumb|Providence Skyscrapers from [[Prospect Terrace Park]]]]
The historic part of downtown has many streetscapes that look as they did eighty years ago. Most of the state's tallest buildings are found here. The largest structure, to date, is the art-deco-styled former Industrial Trust Tower, currently the [[Bank of America Tower (Providence)|Bank of America Building]] at 426 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (130 [[metre|m]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=125380 |title=Bank of America Building, Providence| publisher=Emporis | year=2007 |accessdate = 2007-01-19}}</ref> By contrast, nearby to it is the second tallest [[Sovereign Bank Tower (Providence)|One Financial Center]], designed in modern taut-skin cladding, constructed a half century later.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=125377 | title=One Financial Plaza| year=2006 | publisher=Emporis | accessdate = 2006-06-05}}</ref> In between the two is [[50 Kennedy Plaza]]. The [[Textron Tower]] is also a core building to the modest Providence skyline. Downcity is also the home of the [[Providence Biltmore]] and [[Westminster Arcade]], the oldest enclosed shopping mall in the U.S., built in 1828.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/?id=101896 | title=Providence Buildings, Real Estate, Architecture, Skyscrapers, and Construction Database | year=2005 | publisher=Emporis | accessdate = 2005-11-07}}</ref> 

The city's southern waterfront, away from the downcity core, is the location of many oil tanks, a docking station for a ferry boat, a decommissioned Russian submarine, a non-profit sailing center, bars, strip clubs, and power plants.

The majority of the cityscape comprises abandoned and revitalized industrial mills, double and [[triple decker]] housing (though the [[townhome|row houses]] found in so commonly in other Northeast cities, are notably rare here),<ref>{{cite book |last=Woodward |first=William McKenzie |title=PPS/AIAri Guide to Providence Architecture |year=2003 |publisher=Providence Preservation Society |location=Providence, RI |isbn=0-9742847-0-X |pages=227 }}</ref> a small number of high-rise buildings (predominantly for housing the elderly), and single family homes. [[Interstate 95|I-95]] serves as a physical barrier between the city's commercial core and neighborhoods such as [[Federal Hill, Providence, Rhode Island|Federal Hill]] and the [[West End, Providence, Rhode Island|West End]].

==Climate==
[[Image:Waterplacepark.JPG|thumb|right|Waterplace Park]]
Providence's climate is [[humid continental]], with hot summers, cold winters, and high humidity year-round. The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] rates the city at Zone 6a, which is an "in-between" climate. The influence of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] keeps Providence, and the rest of the state of Rhode Island, warmer than many inland locales in New England.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.usna.usda.gov/Hardzone/hzm-ne1.html | title=USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map | publisher=US Department of Agriculture - The United States National Arboretum | date=[[March 2]] [[2006]] | accessdate = 2007-01-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.growit.com/bin/USDAZoneMaps.exe?MyState=RI | title=Rhode Island ISDA Hardiness Zone Map | year=2000 | publisher=growit.com | accessdate = 2007-01-19}}</ref> January is the coldest month with average high temperatures of 37<U+00B0>&nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|F]] (3<U+00B0>&nbsp;[[Celsius|C]]) and average low temperatures of 20&deg;F (-7&deg;C).<ref name="weather.com-monthly-climate">{{cite web | url=http://www.weather.com/outlook/health/fitness/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/02906?from=36hr_bottomnav_fitness | title=Monthly average temperatures and precipitation | publisher=The Weather Channel | year=2007 | accessdate = 2007-01-17}}</ref> July is the warmest month with average high temperatures of 83&deg;F (28&deg;C) and average low temperatures of 64&deg;F (18&deg;C).<ref name="weather.com-monthly-climate"/> The record high temperature in the city was 104&deg;F (40&deg;C) recorded in 1975.<ref name="weather.com-monthly-climate"/> The record low temperature in the city was -17&deg;F (-27&deg;C) recorded in 1934.<ref name="weather.com-monthly-climate"/>

As with the rest of the northeastern seaboard, Providence receives ample precipitation year-round. Monthly precipitation ranges from a high of 4.43 [[inches]] (112.5 [[1 E-3 m|mm]]) in March to a low of 3.17 inches (80.5 mm) in July.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://weather.yahoo.com/climo/USRI0050_f.html | title=Providence Weather: Records and Averages | publisher=Yahoo! Weather | year=2005 | accessdate = 2005-09-13}}</ref> Precipitation levels are generally slightly lesser in the summer months than the winter months when powerful storms known as [[Nor'easter]]s can cause significant snowfall and [[blizzard]] conditions. Though not frequent, Providence's location at the head of Narragansett Bay makes it vulnerable to Atlantic [[hurricane]]s.

==Economy==
Providence was one of the first cities to industrialize in the United States. By 1830, the city had manufacturing industries in metals, machinery, textiles, jewelry, and silverware. Though manufacturing has declined, the city is still one of the largest centers for [[jewellery|jewelry]] and [[Silver (household)|silverware]] design and manufacturing. Services, particularly education, health care, and finance, also make up a large portion of the city's economy. Providence also is the site of a [[Sectional center facility (SCF)|sectional center facility]], a regional hub for the U.S. Postal Service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.actonelists.com/resources/zip.html|title=
