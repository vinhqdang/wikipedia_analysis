The '''effect of Hurricane Isabel on North Carolina''' was the worst from a hurricane since [[Hurricane Floyd]] made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in 1999. [[Hurricane Isabel]] formed from a [[tropical wave]] on [[September 6]], [[2003]] in the tropical [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165&nbsp;mph (265&nbsp;km/h) on [[September 11]]. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] with winds of 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h) on [[September 18]]. It quickly weakened over land and became [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] over western [[Pennsylvania]] the next day.

Isabel produced moderate to heavy damage across eastern North Carolina, totaling $450&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $495&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD). Damage was heaviest in [[Dare County, North Carolina|Dare County]], where storm surge flooding and strong winds damaged thousands of houses. The storm surge produced a 2,000&nbsp;foot (600&nbsp;m) wide inlet on [[Hatteras Island]], isolating [[Hatteras, North Carolina|Hatteras]] by road for two months. Strong winds downed hundreds of trees of across the state, leaving up to 700,000&nbsp;residents without power. Most areas with power outages had power restored within a few days. The hurricane directly killed one person and indirectly killed two in the state.

==Preparations==
By four days before Isabel made landfall, most [[Global climate model|computer models]] predicted Isabel to make landfall between [[North Carolina]] and [[New Jersey]], and the [[National Hurricane Center]] consistently forecasted a landfall on North Carolina.<ref name="avila33">{{cite web|author=Avila|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Discussion Thirty-Three|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-11-19|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/dis/al132003.discus.033.shtml?}}</ref><ref name="archive">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Advisory Archive|accessdate=2006-11-19|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/ISABEL.shtml?}}</ref> Initially, forecasters predicted a landfall in the northeastern portion of the state,<ref name="avila33"/> though as the hurricane neared land the predicted landfall position was much closer to where it ultimately was. From three days in advance, the average track forecast error for its landfall was only 36&nbsp;miles (58&nbsp;km), and for 48 hours in advance the average track error was 18&nbsp;miles (29&nbsp;km). Strong confidence in Isabel's final landfall prompted the National Hurricane Center to issue a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane watch]] for the entire North Carolina coastline about 50 hours before Isabel struck land. 38 hours before the hurricane made landfall, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning for the landfall area.<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Jack Beven & Hugh Cobb|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=2006-11-20|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003isabel.shtml?}}</ref> The [[Newport, North Carolina|Newport]] [[National Weather Service|Weather Forecast Office]] issued a flood potential statement two days before landfall, which indiciated a threat for flash flooding. The office began preparing for the hurricane one week before landfall, and brought additional staff members to assist with hurricane related duties.<ref name="nws">{{cite web|author=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|year=2004|title=Hurricane Isabel Service Assessment|accessdate=2006-11-24|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/assessments/pdfs/isabel.pdf}}</ref>

Evacuation orders began on [[September 16]], when officials issued a voluntary evacuation for portions of four counties and one entire county. By around 24 hours before landfall, mandatory evacuations were ordered for eight counties, all of which but one were for the entire counties. All coastal counties from [[Cape Fear]] northward were under a mandatory evacuation. A survey of 603 residents in northeastern North Carolina indicated 57% of residents along the [[Outer Banks]] and 77% of residents in [[storm surge]]-prone areas of the [[Pamlico Sound]] did not evacuate despite being under a mandatory evacuation. The two primary reasons stated for the residents' evacuation decisions were the hurricane's strength and track. The media and statements from officials were two other reasons. 70% of people along the Outer Banks heard the official evacuation notices, though only 30% of residents near the Pamlico Sound heard the notices. A majority of the respondents to the survey who heard the evacuation notices left the area. None of the surveyed evacuees from the Outer Banks went to a public shelter; 60% went to a friend or a relative's house and 24% went to a motel. Evacuees on the Outer Banks generally went elsewhere in North Carolina or to Virginia. For evacuees around the Pamlico Sound, only 9% left for a public shelter, while 75% left for a friend or relative's house. Most near the Pamlico Sound remained in their own neighborhood or own county. Of the 19 North Carolina counties issuing evacuation orders, the duration of the evacuation process varied between 3 hours to 12 hours in [[Dare County, North Carolina|Dare County]]. Five counties reported heavy amounts of traffic, while traffic problems included stalled cars along roads, inadequate route signing, and flooded or damaged roads.<ref name="assess">{{cite web|author=Post, Buckley, Schuh and Jernigan|year=2005|title=Hurricane Isabel Assessment, a Review of Hurricane Evacuation Study Products and Other Aspects of the National Hurricane Mitigation and Preparedness Program (NHMPP) in the Context of the Hurricane Isabel Response|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2006-11-27|url=http://www.csc.noaa.gov/hes/docs/postStorm/Isabel_PostStorm_Summary.pdf}}</ref>

By the morning of the hurricane's landfall, 65 shelters were prepared with a capacity of 95,000 people. The [[American Red Cross]] prepared 100 feeding vehicles in staging areas, and deployed two mobile kitchens each with the capacity to provide 10,000 meals per day. Additionally, five [[Southern Baptist Convention]] kitchens were on standby, in total being able to provide 20,000 meals per day.<ref name="shelters1">{{cite web|author=FEMA|year=2003|title=North Carolina Mass Care Update|accessdate=2006-12-04|url=http://www.gismaps.fema.gov/2003graphics/storms/isabel/shelters_0918_330_nc.jpg}}</ref>

==Impact==
[[Image:Hurricane Isabel Storm Tide.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Storm tides]]
Hurricane Isabel produced hurricane force wind gusts throughout eastern [[North Carolina]]. The winds downed hundreds of trees, leaving up to 700,000 without power across the state.<ref name="nws"/> Damage from the hurricane totaled about $450&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $495&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD).<ref name="ncdc">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=2003|title=Event Report for North Carolina|accessdate=2006-12-06|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~514235}}</ref> Three people were killed in the state, two due to falling trees and one due to a utility worker attempting to restore electricity.<ref name="isab">{{cite web|author=Sunbelt Rentals|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Aftermath|accessdate=2006-12-09|url=http://www.sunbeltrentals.com/news/HurricaneIsabelAftermath.pdf}}</ref>

===Outer Banks===
[[Image:46 9 21 03 14.jpg|right|thumb|Damage to the Barrier Islands after Hurricane Isabel (USGS)]]
Hurricane Isabel first began affecting North Carolina about 15 hours before it struck land. Upon making landfall along the [[Outer Banks]], the hurricane produced strong waves of 15 to 25&nbsp;feet (4.5 to 6&nbsp;m) in height and a storm surge of about 6 to 8&nbsp;feet (1.8 to 2.4&nbsp;m).<ref name="nws"/> Waters reached a height of 7.15 feet in [[Hatteras, North Carolina|Hatteras]].<ref name="chfp">{{cite web|author=Kriehn|year=2003|title=Coastal Water Level Rises Associated with Hurricane Isabel|publisher=Newport, North Carolina National Weather Service|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2006-12-06|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/mhx/Images/IsabelCapeHatterasFP.gif}}</ref> Storm tides along the coast peaked at 7.7&nbsp;feet (2.3&nbsp;m) in [[Cape Hatteras]], though it the total could be higher there due to the tide gage being destroyed from the hurricane.<ref name="nws"/> The surge and waves created a new [[inlet]] by washing out a portion of [[Hatteras Island]] between [[Hatteras, North Carolina|Hatteras]] and [[Frisco, North Carolina|Frisco]]. Unofficially named [[Isabel Inlet]], the break was 2,000&nbsp;foot (600&nbsp;m) wide and 15&nbsp;foot (3&nbsp;m) deep break, and consisted of three distinct channels. The formation of the inlet destroyed a portion of [[North Carolina Highway 12]],<ref name="natgeo">{{cite web|author=John Roach|year=2003|title=Shoring Up N. Carolina Islands: A Losing Battle?|publisher=National Geographic News|accessdate=2006-12-05|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/11/1110_031110_outerbanks.html}}</ref> and also washed out three homes,<ref name="nws"/> dunes, power lines, and utility pipes.<ref name="outban">{{cite web|author=Fred Hurteau|year=2003|title=The Dynamic Landscape of the Outer Banks|publisher=Outer Banks Guidebook|accessdate=2006-12-05|url=http://www.outerbanksguidebook.com/dynamic.htm}}</ref> The new inlet destroyed all utility connections to Hatteras Island, isolating the residents there. The storm surge and waves from Isabel also resulted in a breach between Hatteras and [[Hatteras Inlet]]. The breach, which nearly became an inlet, formed from the flow of ocean water across the island, though it was not deep enough for a constant water flow. The breach occurred in an area without roads or houses, and had little impact on Hatteras residents.<ref name="outban"/> Rough surf and storm surge caused overwash and severe beach erosion throughout the Outer Banks, with flooding in [[Ocracoke, North Carolina|Ocracoke]] reportedly being up to waist-high.<ref name="newportnws">{{cite web|author=Kriehn|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Impacts Eastern North Carolina|publisher=Newport, North Carolina National Weather Service|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2006-12-05|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/mhx/HurricaneIsabel.html}}</ref> The hurricane produced an estimated 4&nbsp;inches (100&nbsp;mm) of rain throughout most of the Outer Banks, with [[Duck, North Carolina|Duck]] reporting a peak of 4.72&nbsp;inches (120&nbsp;mm). Wind gusts in association with the hurricane peaked at 105&nbsp;mph (170&nbsp;km/h) in [[Ocracoke, North Carolina|Ocracoke]], with several other locations reporting hurricane force gusts.<ref name="newportnws"/>

Wind and water damage across the Outer Banks was extensive. Strong waves and the storm surge from Hurricane Isabel knocked about 30 to 40 houses and several motels off of their pilings.<ref name="newportnws"/> Two families who did not evacuate were nearly swept out to sea when their home was destroyed. Local rescue was unable to reach them; however, they were ultimately able to reach safety.<ref name="nws"/> The rough waves greatly affected piers in [[Nags Head, North Carolina|Nags Head]], [[Rodanthe, North Carolina|Rodanthe]], and Frisco, with three being completely destroyed. Several locations along North Carolina Highway 12 were partially washed out or covered with debris, and 15&nbsp;foot (4.5&nbsp;m) sections of pavement on both sides of a bridge near Ocracoke were washed away. Strong waves destroyed a beach access ramp, as well.<ref name="newportnws"/> Several thousand homes and businesses were damaged by the passage of the hurricane, and damage in [[Dare County, North Carolina|Dare County]] totaled nearly $350&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $384&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD). In the Outer Banks, no deaths or injuries were reported.<ref name="ncdc"/>

===Southeast North Carolina===
The effects of Hurricane Isabel were generally light in the southeastern portion of the state.<!--SE North Carolina here is limited to Wilmington NWS area--> Sustained reached 72&nbsp;mph (116&nbsp;km/h) in the [[Frying Pan Shoals]], where a gust of 82&nbsp;mph (132&nbsp;km/h) was also reported. Sustained winds were lighter along the coast, peaking at 45&nbsp;mph (72&nbsp;km/h) at the [[Wilmington International Airport]], while gusts reached 66&nbsp;mph (106&nbsp;km/h) at a [[North Carolina State Ports Authority]] facility in [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]]. Tropical storm force wind gusts were reported as far inland as [[Lumberton, North Carolina|Lumberton]], where gusts reached 52&nbsp;mph (54&nbsp;km/h). The large circulation of Isabel dropped moderate rainfall across the area, peaking at 4.51&nbsp;inches (115&nbsp;mm) in [[Whiteville, North Carolina|Whiteville]]. Additionally, weather radars estimated over 5&nbsp;inches (125&nbsp;mm) of precipitation fell in portions of [[New Hanover County, North Carolina|New Hanover County]]. The rainfall resulted in ponding on roadways, though no severe flooding was reported. Storm tides were generally around 1&nbsp;foot (0.3&nbsp;m) above normal,<ref name="wilnws">{{cite web|author=Wilmington, North Carolina National Weather Service|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel in Southeast North Carolina|accessdate=2006-12-06|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/ilm/archive/09-18-03/index.shtml}}</ref> though Wilmington reported a storm tide of 3.22&nbsp;feet (1&nbsp;m).<ref name="nws"/> Rough waves resulted in moderate beach erosion near [[Cape Fear]] and minor erosion along eastward-facing beaches north of Cape Fear.<ref name="wilnws"/>

Damage was minor in southeast North Carolina. Moderate winds inflicted isolated shingle and siding damage along barrier islands. The winds downed several trees, some onto cars and houses. Brief power outages were also reported.<ref name="wilnws"/> Beach erosion damaged a bridge in [[Bald Head Island, North Carolina|Bald Head Island]], as well.<ref name="sencdc">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=2003|title=Event Report for Southeast North Carolina|accessdate=2006-12-06|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~514238}}</ref> In [[Chowan County, North Carolina|Chowan County]], a business parking lot was under several feet of water due to flash flooding.<ref name="cesncdc">{{cite web|author=NCDC|year=2003|title=Event Report for Southeast North Carolina (2)|accessdate=2006-12-06|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~514240}}</ref> One person was indirectly killed in [[Carteret County, North Carolina|Carteret County]] when trying to restore electricity.<ref name="newportnws"/>

===Inland===
[[Image:Edenton, NC damage.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Damage in [[Edenton, North Carolina|Edenton]]]]
Isabel produced strong winds throughout inland areas of eastern North Carolina. [[Plymouth, North Carolina|Plymouth]], located 75&nbsp;miles (120&nbsp;km) from where the hurricane made landfall, reported gusts to 95&nbsp;mph (155&nbsp;km/h). Sustained winds were lighter, with only a few locations receiving tropical storm strength winds. The passage of the hurricane resulted in moderate rainfall of up to 6.02&nbsp;inches (153&nbsp;mm) in [[Havelock, North Carolina|Havelock]]. Upon making landfall, Isabel produced moderate to severe storm surges along the [[Pamlico River|Pamlico]] and [[Neuse River]]s, with a location in [[Craven County, North Carolina|Craven County]] reporting a storm tide of 10.5&nbsp;feet (3.2&nbsp;m) above normal.<ref name="newportnws"/>

The strong storm surge produced significant flooding in [[Harlowe, North Carolina|Harlowe]] and [[Oriental, North Carolina|Oriental]]. Several other locations also reported flooding of streets and low-lying areas. The rise of water flooded many homes in Craven County and the eastern portions of [[Carteret County, North Carolina|Carteret]] and [[Pamlico County, North Carolina|Pamlico]] counties.<ref name="newportnws"/> Emergency personnel performed many rescues to people who had not evacuated and had become trapped by storm surge flooding. Several eyewittnesses reported high velocity, waist deep water moving homes, trailers, and other objects many yards inland. As the water retreated, these objects were then dragged back towards the sound. A 5 to 8&nbsp;foot (1.5 to 2.4&nbsp;m) storm surge struck the western portion of the [[Albemarle Sound]], with significant surge flooding occurring to the west of [[Edenton, North Carolina|Edenton]]. There, the surge destroyed four homes, two of which were moved up to 20 feet off their concrete block foundations. Nearly 60 percent of all homes and business in [[Chowan County, North Carolina|Chowan County]] suffered some structural damage due to wind, many of which were the result of large falling trees. One female died when a tree fell on her vehicle in Chowan County.<ref name="nws"/>

==Aftermath==
[[Image:Hatteras- Before and after Isabel.JPG|right|thumb|350px|[[Hatteras Island]] before and after Isabel]]
Hundreds of residents were stranded in [[Hatteras, North Carolina|Hatteras]] following the formation of the new inlet created by rising waters. Many parts of [[North Carolina Highway 12]] were partially washed or damaged, which slowed recovery efforts and the return of homeowners in the [[Outer Banks]].<ref name="isab"/> Sections of the highway were closed to one lane. The ferry between [[Hatteras Island]] and [[Ocracoke Island]] was temporarily closed due to damage after the hurricane, though a small passanger ferry remained available for Hatteras Village residents and emergency workers. People who were not residents were not allowed to be on the [[Outer Banks]] for two weeks after the hurricane due to damaged road conditions. When visitors were allowed to return, many ventured to see the new inlet, despite a 1&nbsp;mile (1.6&nbsp;km) walk from the nearest road.<ref name="outban"/> 

Initially, long term solutions to the Isabel Inlet such as building a bridge or a ferry system were considered, though they were ultimately cancelled in favor of pumping sand and filling the inlet. Coastal geologists were opposed to the solution, stating the evolution of the Outer Banks is dependent on inlets from hurricanes.<ref name="natgeo"/> Dredging operations began on [[October 17]], about a month after the hurricane struck. The [[United States Geological Survey]] used sand from the ferry channel to the southwest of Hatteras Island, a choice made to minimize impact to submerged aquatic vegetation and due to the channel being filled somewhat during the hurricane.<ref name="fem3">{{cite web|author=Federal Emergency Management Agency|year=2003|title=Dredging Operations Begin|accessdate=2006-12-16|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=6315}}</ref> On [[November 22]], 2003, about two months after the hurricane struck, Highway 12 and Hatteras Island were reopened to public access. On the same day, the ferry between Hatteras and Ocracoke was reopened. The breach on the southern end of Hatteras Island was filled in with sand, as well.<ref name="outban"/>

Hardware stores experienced great demand for portable generators, chain saws, dehumidifiers, and air movers following the passage of the hurricane. Utility crews from across the country came to the state to assist in returning power,<ref name="isab"/> though power outages persisted for several days.<ref name="outban"/> Over 2,500 utility members worked, in some cases around the clock, to restore the power. One power company restored power to 68% of its affects customers by the day after Isabel passed through the area.<ref name="hurrisbl">{{cite web|author=United States Department of Energy|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Situation Report: September 19, 2003|accessdate=2006-12-16|url=http://www.oe.netl.doe.gov/docs/isabel/hurrisabel_sitrep_091903_1600.pdf}}</ref> By four days after landfall, 83,000 customers were without power, down from its peak of several hundred thousand.<ref name="fem2">{{cite web|author=Federal Emergency Management Agency|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Update|accessdate=2006-12-16|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=5019}}</ref>

[[Image:Isabel Disaster.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Counties declared as Disaster Areas]]
Hours after Isabel made landfall, [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] issued a major disaster declaration for 26 [[List of North Carolina counties|North Carolina counties]], which allowed the use of federal personnel, equipment and lifesaving systems and the delivery of heavy-duty generators, plastic sheeting, tents, cots, food, water, medical aid and other essential supplies and materials for sustaining human life. The declaration also allocated federal funds for the long-term recovery of hurricane-stricken residents and business owners, as well as providing federal funds for the state and local governments to pay 75 percent of the eligible cost for debris removal and emergency services related to the hurricane, including requested emergency work undertaken by the federal government.<ref name="fema">{{cite web|author=Federal Emergency Management Agency|year=2003|title=President Orders Disaster Aid For North Carolina Hurricane Victims|accessdate=2006-12-16|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=5019}}</ref> By four days after the emergency declaration, assistance checks were mailed and used by residents to pay for what was not covered by their insurance.<ref name="fem2"/>

By four days after landfall, [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] served around 68,000 meals to displaced families. More than a dozen disaster recovery centers were initiated throughout the state. FEMA provided 125,000 pounds of ice in the first few days, and prepared 200,000 pounds of ice and 180,000 liters of water for the following week<ref name="fem2"/> for the remaining communities without water. By six days after Isabel struck the state, all hospitals were opened and all roads excluding North Carolina Highway 12 were passable due to emergency crews clearing roads with debris.<ref name="fem3">{{cite web|author=Federal Emergency Management Agency|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Update (2)|accessdate=2006-12-16|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=5176}}</ref> By about one month after the hurricane struck, 32,560 North Carolina residents applied for federal assistance, with disaster aid totaling about $50&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $55&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD).
