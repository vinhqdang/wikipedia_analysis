In interest group ratings from his time in office, Kind has supported women<U+2019>s issues, poverty reform, veterans issues, social security, environmental issues, education, and civil rights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=630#How |title=Project Vote Smart - Representative Ronald James 'Ron' Kind - Interest Group Ratings |publisher=Votesmart.org |date=2010-05-14 |accessdate=2010-07-12}}</ref>

Kind was the lone Wisconsin Democrat to support free trade with China, despite pressure from unions that claimed trade with China is costing jobs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ron Kind Wisconsin 2012 election center|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/campaign-2012/candidates/ron-kind-1094/|accessdate=August 23, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Ron Kind">{{cite web|title=Ron Kind on the issues|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Ron_Kind.htm|accessdate=August 23, 2012}}</ref> 

After the failed effort to recall Governor Scott Walker in an April 2012 vote, Kind said that 
Democrats should be proud of forcing recall elections despite the outcome. He said that his conversations with voters had convinced him that the only reason that Democrats lost was because people didn<U+2019>t think it was not a proper use of the recall process.<ref>{{cite web|title=NBC 15 Madison, Wisconsin|url=http://www.nbc15.com/home/headlines/US_Rep_Ron_Kind_Applauds_Dems_for_Recall_Efforts_158267415.html|accessdate=August 23, 2012}}</ref>

===Childhood obesity===
Kind wrote the Health Kids Outdoors Act of 2010. This legislation was criticized by conservatives, who expressed concern with the fact that it would track children<U+2019>s BMI<U+2019>s and that it would tell parents how to raise their children.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moran|first=Rick|title=American Thinker|url=http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2010/05/government_to_track_your_child.html|accessdate=August 24, 2012}}</ref> 

He is the House sponsor of the FIT Kids Act, federal legislation that would require school districts to report on students' physical activity and to give youngsters health and nutritional information.<ref>{{cite web|title=NFL News|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3997041|accessdate=August 24, 2012}}</ref> 

In 2011, Kind wrote a piece about <U+201C>the childhood obesity epidemic,<U+201D> in which he promoted both the FIT Kids Act and the Healthy Kids Outdoors Act.  He said that healthy bodies lead to healthy minds, and that his FIT Kids Act would push parents and the public by requiring the states and school districts to report on the children<U+2019>s physical activity. As for the Healthy Kids Outdoors Act, it <U+201C>provides state-level incentives to develop five-year state strategies to connect children, youth and families with nature and promote outdoor recreation in communities.<U+201D><ref>{{cite web|last=Kind|first=Ron|title=Halting the childhood obesity epidemic requires support of many communities|url=http://thehill.com/special-reports/healthcare-february-2012/209277-halting-the-childhood-obesity-epidemic-requires-support-of-many-communities|accessdate=August 24, 2012}}</ref>

==Agricultural issues==
Kind has been actively involved in agricultural policy; he was even considered a possible candidate for Agricultural secretary in 2008. While he represents some of the country's most productive dairy farms, he opposes agricultural subsidies.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hubbuch|first=Chris|title=Rep. Ron Kind to eye crop subsidy reform|url=http://lacrossetribune.com/news/rep-ron-kind-to-eye-crop-subsidy-reform/article_33443bf4-48aa-11e1-b5ed-0019bb2963f4.html|accessdate=August 27, 2012}}</ref> Kind co-sponsored a bill that would have eliminated subsidies for those earning over $250,000 while increasing funding for conservation and rural development. Nancy Pelosi, who had worked to make the original bill accommodating for Democratic interests, was upset with the bill. Agicultural Committee Chairman Collin Peterson said Kind was <U+201C>a lone ranger on this, and he<U+2019>s dividing the caucus, and I don<U+2019>t appreciate it.<U+201D>  <ref>{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Julie|title=Farm bill spurs split in Dem's ranks|accessdate=August 27, 2012|newspaper=Bangor Daily News|date=July 25, 2007}}</ref>

==Political campaigns==
===1996===
Kind was first elected to represent {{ushr|Wisconsin|3}} in November 1996. In September 1995, he had announced his intention to run for the 3rd Congressional District seat being vacated by 16-year incumbent [[Steve Gunderson]]. Kind later won a five-way race for the Democratic nomination and went on to defeat his [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opponent, [[James Harsdorf]] 52 percent to 48 percent, becoming only the second Democrat to represent this district in the 20th century.  Kind didn't face another contest nearly that close until 2010.

There was talk that Kind might run for the U.S. Senate in 2012, but he decided not to mount a primary challenge to Tommy Baldwin, who had already announced a senate run.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stewart|first=Rebecca|title=Rep. Ron Kind declines senate bid|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/15/rep-ron-kind-declines-senate-bid/|accessdate=August 26, 2012}}</ref>. There was also a push to draft Kind to run for governor in 2012 against Scott Walker.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kind, Obey avoid confirming recall petition signatures|url=http://www.wxow.com/story/16481255/some-potential-candidates-in-recall-delay-signing-petition|accessdate=August 26, 2012}}</ref>

Kind ultimately decided to run for reelection in the 3rd district. He will face retired U.S. Army Col. Ray Boland in the November election.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shuda|first=Nathaniel|title=U.S. Reps.
