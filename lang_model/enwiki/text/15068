'''Distillation''' is a method of [[separation process|separating]] [[mixture]]s based on differences in [[Volatility (physics)|volatilities]] of components in a boiling liquid mixture. Distillation is a [[unit operation]], or a physical separation process, and not a [[chemical reaction]].

Commercially, distillation has a number of applications. It is used to separate [[crude oil]] into more fractions for specific uses such as [[transport]], [[power generation]] and heating. Water is distilled to remove impurities, such as salt from seawater. Air is distilled to separate its components<U+2014>notably [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], and [[argon]]<U+2014> for industrial use. Distillation of [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] [[solution]]s has been used since ancient times to produce [[distilled beverage]]s with a higher alcohol content. The premises where distillation is carried out, especially distillation of alcohol, are known as a '''[[wikt:distillery|distillery]]'''.

As [[alchemy]] evolved into the science of [[chemistry]], vessels called [[retort]]s became used for distillations. Both [[alembic]]s and retorts are forms of [[Laboratory glassware|glassware]] with long necks pointing to the side at a downward angle which acted as air-cooled [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condensers]] to [[Condensation|condense]] the distillate and let it drip downward for collection. Later, copper alembics were invented. Riveted joints were often kept tight by using various mixtures, for instance a dough made of rye flour.<ref>[http://www.copper-alembic.com/manufacturing/specs_sealing.php Sealing Technique], accessed 16 November 2006.</ref> These alembics often featured a cooling system around the beak, using cold water for instance, which made the condensation of alcohol more efficient. These were called [[pot still]]s. Today, the retorts and pot stills have been largely supplanted by more efficient distillation methods in most industrial processes. However, the pot still is still widely used for the elaboration of some fine alcohols such as [[cognac (drink)|cognac]], [[Scotch whisky]], [[tequila]] and some [[vodka]]s. Pot stills made of various materials (wood, clay, stainless steel) are also used by [[Rum-runner|bootleggers]] in various countries. Small pot stills are also sold for the domestic production<ref>[http://www.essentialoil.com/alembic5.html Traditional Alembic Pot Still], accessed 16 November 2006.</ref> of flower water or [[essential oils]].

Early forms of distillation were batch processes using one vaporization and one condensation. Purity was improved by further distillation of the condensate. Greater volumes were processed by simply repeating the distillation. Chemists were reported to carry out as many as 500 to 600 distillations in order to obtain a pure compound.<ref name=Othmer>D. F. Othmer (1982) ''Distillation <U+2013> Some Steps in its Development'', in W. F. Furter (ed) ''A Century of Chemical Engineering'' ISBN 0-306-40895-3</ref>

In the early 19th century the basics of modern techniques including pre-heating and reflux were developed, particularly by the French,<ref name=Othmer/> then in 1830 a British [[Patent]] was issued to [[Aeneas Coffey]] for a whiskey distillation column,<ref>A. Coffey British Patent 5974, 5 August 1830</ref> which worked continuously and may be regarded as the [[archetype]] of modern petrochemical units. In 1877, [[Ernest Solvay]] was granted a U.S. Patent for a tray column for [[ammonia]] distillation<ref>{{US patent|198699}} Improvement in the Ammonia-Soda Manufacture</ref> and the same and subsequent years saw developments of this theme for oil and spirits.

With the emergence of [[chemical engineering]] as a discipline at the end of the 19th century, scientific rather than empirical methods could be applied. The developing [[petroleum]] industry in the early 20th century provided the impetus for the development of accurate design methods such as the [[McCabe-Thiele method]] and the [[Fenske equation]]. The availability of powerful computers has also allowed direct [[computer simulation]] of distillation columns.

==Applications of distillation==
The application of distillation can roughly be divided in four groups: [[#Laboratory scale distillation|laboratory scale]], [[#Industrial distillation|industrial distillation]], distillation of herbs for perfumery and medicinals ([[herbal distillate]]), and [[#Distillation in food processing|food processing]]. The latter two are distinctively different from the former two in that in the processing of beverages, the distillation is not used as a true purification method but more to transfer all [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatiles]] from the source materials to the distillate.

The main difference between laboratory scale distillation and industrial distillation is that laboratory scale distillation is often performed batch-wise, whereas industrial distillation often occurs continuously. In [[batch distillation]], the composition of the source material, the vapors of the distilling compounds and the distillate change during the distillation. In batch distillation, a still is charged (supplied) with a batch of feed mixture, which is then separated into its component fractions which are collected sequentially from most volatile to less volatile, with the bottoms (remaining least or non-volatile fraction) removed at the end. The still can then be recharged and the process repeated.

In [[continuous distillation]], the source materials, vapors, and distillate are kept at a constant composition by carefully replenishing the source material and removing fractions from both vapor and liquid in the system. This results in a better control of the separation process.

==Idealized distillation model==
The [[boiling point]] of a liquid is the temperature at which the [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid equals the pressure in the liquid, enabling bubbles to form without being crushed. A special case is the [[normal boiling point]], where the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the ambient [[atmospheric pressure]].

It is a common misconception that in a liquid mixture at a given pressure, each component boils at the boiling point corresponding to the given pressure and the vapors of each component will collect separately and purely. This, however, does not occur even in an idealized system. Idealized models of distillation are essentially governed by [[Raoult's law]] and [[Dalton's law]], and assume that [[Vapor-liquid equilibrium|vapor-liquid equilibria]] are attained.

Raoult's law assumes that a component contributes to the total [[vapor pressure]] of the mixture in proportion to its percentage of the mixture and its vapor pressure when pure, or succinctly: partial pressure equals mole fraction multiplied by vapor pressure when pure. If one component changes another component's vapor pressure, or if the volatility of a component is dependent on its percentage in the mixture, the law will fail.

Dalton's law states that the total vapor pressure is the sum of the vapor pressures of each individual component in the mixture. When a multi-component liquid is heated, the vapor pressure of each component will rise, thus causing the total vapor pressure to rise. When the total vapor pressure reaches the pressure surrounding the liquid, [[boiling]] occurs and liquid turns to gas throughout the bulk of the liquid. Note that a mixture with a given composition has one boiling point at a given pressure, when the components are mutually soluble.

An implication of one boiling point is that lighter components never cleanly "boil first". At boiling point, all volatile components boil, but for a component, its percentage in the vapor is the same as its percentage of the total vapor pressure. Lighter components have a higher partial pressure and thus are concentrated in the vapor, but heavier volatile components also have a (smaller) partial pressure and necessarily evaporate also, albeit being less concentrated in the vapor. Indeed, batch distillation and fractionation succeed by varying the composition of the mixture. In batch distillation, the batch evaporates, which changes its composition; in fractionation, liquid higher in the fractionation column contains more lights and boils at lower temperatures.

The idealized model is accurate in the case of chemically similar liquids, such as [[benzene]] and [[toluene]]. In other cases, severe deviations from Raoult's law and Dalton's law are observed, most famously in the mixture of ethanol and water. These compounds, when heated together, form an [[azeotrope]], which is a composition with a boiling point higher or lower than the boiling point of each separate liquid. Virtually all liquids, when mixed and heated, will display azeotropic behaviour. Although there are [[computational chemistry|computational methods]] that can be used to estimate the behavior of a mixture of arbitrary components, the only way to obtain accurate [[vapor-liquid equilibrium]] data is by measurement.

It is not possible to ''completely'' purify a mixture of components by distillation, as this would require each component in the mixture to have a zero [[partial pressure]]. If ultra-pure products are the goal, then further [[Separation of chemicals|chemical separation]] must be applied. When a binary mixture is evaporated and the other component, e.g. a salt, has zero partial pressure for practical purposes, the process is simpler and is called [[evaporation]] in engineering.

===Batch distillation===
{{Main|Batch distillation}}

[[File:BatchDistill.svg|thumb|left|A batch still showing the separation of A and B.]]
Heating an ideal mixture of two volatile substances A and B (with A having the higher volatility, or lower boiling point) in a batch distillation setup (such as in an apparatus depicted in the opening figure) until the mixture is boiling results in a vapor above the liquid which contains a mixture of A and B. The ratio between A and B in the vapor will be different from the ratio in the liquid: the ratio in the liquid will be determined by how the original mixture was prepared, while the ratio in the vapor will be enriched in the more volatile compound, A (due to Raoult's Law, see above). The vapor goes through the condenser and is removed from the system. This in turn means that the ratio of compounds in the remaining liquid is now different from the initial ratio (i.e. more enriched in B than the starting liquid).

The result is that the ratio in the liquid mixture is changing, becoming richer in component B. This causes the boiling point of the mixture to rise, which in turn results in a rise in the temperature in the vapor, which results in a changing ratio of A : B in the gas phase (as distillation continues, there is an increasing proportion of B in the gas phase). This results in a slowly changing ratio A : B in the distillate.

If the difference in vapor pressure between the two components A and B is large (generally expressed as the difference in boiling points), the mixture in the beginning of the distillation is highly enriched in component A, and when component A has distilled off, the boiling liquid is enriched in component B.

===Continuous distillation===
{{Main|Continuous distillation}}

Continuous distillation is an ongoing distillation in which a liquid mixture is continuously (without interruption) fed into the process and separated fractions are removed continuously as output streams as time passes during the operation. Continuous distillation produces at least two output fractions, including at least one [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] distillate fraction, which has boiled and been separately captured as a vapor condensed to a liquid. There is always a bottoms (or residue) fraction, which is the least volatile residue that has not been separately captured as a condensed vapor.

Continuous distillation differs from batch distillation in the respect that concentrations should not change over time. Continuous distillation can be run at a [[steady state]] for an arbitrary amount of time. For any source material of specific composition, the main variables that affect the purity of products in continuous distillation are the reflux ratio and the number of theoretical equilibrium stages (practically, the number of trays or the height of packing). Reflux is a flow from the condenser back to the column, which generates a recycle that allows a better separation with a given number of trays. Equilibrium stages are ideal steps where compositions achieve vapor-liquid equilibrium, repeating the separation process and allowing better separation given a reflux ratio. A column with a high reflux ratio may have fewer stages, but it refluxes a large amount of liquid, giving a wide column with a large holdup. Conversely, a column with a low reflux ratio must have a large number of stages, thus requiring a taller column.

===General improvements===
Both batch and continuous distillations can be improved by making use of a [[fractionating column]] on top of the distillation flask. The column improves separation by providing a larger surface area for the vapor and condensate to come into contact. This helps it remain at equilibrium for as long as possible. The column can even consist of small subsystems ('trays' or 'dishes') which all contain an enriched, boiling liquid mixture, all with their own vapor-liquid equilibrium.

There are differences between laboratory-scale and industrial-scale fractionating columns, but the principles are the same. Examples of laboratory-scale fractionating columns (in increasing efficiency) include:
*[[Condenser (laboratory)#Air condenser|Air condenser]]
*[[Vigreux column]] (usually laboratory scale only)
*[[Packed bed|Packed column]] (packed with glass beads, metal pieces, or other chemically inert material)
*[[Spinning band distillation]] system.

==Laboratory scale distillation==
Laboratory scale distillations are almost exclusively run as batch distillations. The device used in distillation, sometimes referred to as a ''[[still]]'', consists at a minimum of a '''reboiler''' or ''pot'' in which the source material is heated, a '''condenser''' in which the heated [[gas|vapour]] is cooled back to the liquid [[phase (matter)|state]], and a '''receiver''' in which the concentrated or purified liquid, called the '''distillate''', is collected. Several laboratory scale techniques for distillation exist (see also [[:Category:Distillation|distillation types]]).

===Simple distillation===
<!-- This section is linked from [[Fractional distillation]] -->
In '''simple distillation''', all the hot vapors produced are immediately channeled into a condenser that cools and condenses the vapors. Therefore, the distillate will not be pure <U+2013> its composition will be identical to the composition of the vapors at the given temperature and pressure, and can be computed from [[Raoult's law]].

As a result, simple distillation is usually used only to separate liquids whose boiling points differ greatly (rule of thumb is 25 <U+00B0>C),<ref>[http://www.iupac.org/didac/Didac%20Eng/Didac05/Content/ST07.htm ST07 Separation of liquid <U+2013> liquid mixtures (solutions)], DIDAC by [[IUPAC]]</ref> or to separate liquids from non-volatile solids or oils. For these cases, the vapor pressures of the components are usually sufficiently different that Raoult's law may be neglected due to the insignificant contribution of the less volatile component. In this case, the distillate may be sufficiently pure for its intended purpose.

===Fractional distillation===
{{Main|Fractional distillation}}
For many cases, the boiling points of the components in the mixture will be sufficiently close that Raoult's law must be taken into consideration. Therefore, '''fractional distillation''' must be used in order to separate the components by repeated vaporization-condensation cycles within a packed fractionating column. This separation, by successive distillations, is also referred to as '''rectification'''.<ref name=Perry/>

As the solution to be purified is heated, its vapors rise to the [[fractionating column]]. As it rises, it cools, condensing on the condenser walls and the surfaces of the packing material. Here, the condensate continues to be heated by the rising hot vapors; it vaporizes once more. However, the composition of the fresh vapors are determined once again by Raoult's law. Each vaporization-condensation cycle (called a ''[[theoretical plate]]'') will yield a purer solution of the more volatile component.<ref>[http://wulfenite.fandm.edu/labtech/fractdistill.htm Fractional Distillation]</ref> In reality, each cycle at a given temperature does not occur at exactly the same position in the fractionating column; ''theoretical plate'' is thus a concept rather than an accurate description.

More theoretical plates lead to better separations. A [[spinning band distillation]] system uses a spinning band of [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] or metal to force the rising vapors into close contact with the descending condensate, increasing the number of theoretical plates.<ref>[http://www.brinstrument.com/fractional-distillation/spinning_band_distillation.html Spinning Band Distillation] at B/R Instrument Corporation (accessed 8 September 2006)</ref>

===Steam distillation===
{{Main|Steam distillation}}
Like [[vacuum distillation]], '''steam distillation''' is a method for distilling compounds which are heat-sensitive.<ref name=HarwoodMoodyEOCPAP151>{{Cite book

|publisher= Wiley, Blackwell}}</ref> The temperature of the steam is easier to control than the surface of a heating element, and allows a high rate of heat transfer without heating at a very high temperature.  This process involves bubbling steam through a heated mixture of the raw material. By Raoult's law, some of the target compound will vaporize (in accordance with its partial pressure). The vapor mixture is cooled and condensed, usually yielding a layer of oil and a layer of water.

Steam distillation of various [[aromatic]] herbs and flowers can result in two products; an [[essential oil]] as well as a watery [[herbal distillate]]. The [[essential oils]] are often used in perfumery and [[aromatherapy]] while the watery distillates have many applications in [[aromatherapy]], [[food processing]] and [[skin care]].

===Vacuum distillation===
{{Main|Vacuum distillation}}
Some compounds have very high boiling points. To boil such compounds, it is often better to lower the pressure at which such compounds are boiled instead of increasing the temperature. Once the pressure is lowered to the vapor pressure of the compound (at the given temperature), boiling and the rest of the distillation process can commence. This technique is referred to as '''vacuum distillation''' and it is commonly found in the laboratory in the form of the [[rotary evaporator]].

This technique is also very useful for compounds which boil beyond their [[decomposition temperature]] at atmospheric pressure and which would therefore be decomposed by any attempt to boil them under atmospheric pressure.

'''Molecular distillation''' is vacuum distillation below the pressure of 0.01 torr.<ref>Vogel's 5th ed.</ref> 0.01 torr is one order of magnitude above [[Vacuum#Quality|high vacuum]], where fluids are in the [[free molecular flow]] regime, i.e. the [[mean free path]] of molecules is comparable to the size of the equipment. The gaseous phase no longer exerts significant pressure on the substance to be evaporated, and consequently, rate of evaporation no longer depends on pressure. That is, because the continuum assumptions of fluid dynamics no longer apply, mass transport is governed by molecular dynamics rather than fluid dynamics. Thus, a short path between the hot surface and the cold surface is necessary, typically by suspending a hot plate covered with a film of feed next to a cold plate with a line of sight in between. Molecular distillation is used industrially for purification of oils.

===Air-sensitive vacuum distillation===
Some compounds have high boiling points as well as being [[air sensitive]]. A simple vacuum distillation system as exemplified above can be used, whereby the vacuum is replaced with an inert gas after the distillation is complete. However, this is a less satisfactory system if one desires to collect fractions under a reduced pressure. To do this a "cow" or "pig" adaptor can be added to the end of the condenser, or for better results or for very air sensitive compounds a [[Perkin triangle]] apparatus can be used.

The Perkin triangle, has means via a series of glass or [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] taps to allows fractions to be isolated from the rest of the [[still]], without the main body of the distillation being removed from either the vacuum or heat source, and thus can remain in a state of [[reflux]]. To do this, the sample is first isolated from the vacuum by means of the taps, the vacuum over the sample is then replaced with an inert gas (such as [[nitrogen]] or [[argon]]) and can then be stoppered and removed. A fresh collection vessel can then be added to the system, evacuated and linked back into the distillation system via the taps to collect a second fraction, and so on, until all fractions have been collected.

===Short path distillation===
[[File:short path distillation apparatus.svg|thumb|right|Short path vacuum distillation apparatus with vertical condenser (cold finger), to minimize the distillation path; '''1: ''' Still pot with stirrer bar/anti-bumping granules '''2: ''' Cold finger <U+2013> bent to direct condensate '''3: ''' Cooling water out '''4: ''' cooling water in '''5: ''' Vacuum/gas inlet '''6: ''' Distillate flask/distillate.]]
'''Short path distillation''' is a distillation technique that involves the distillate travelling a short distance, often only a few centimeters, and is normally done at reduced pressure.<ref name=HarwoodMoodyEOCPAP150>{{Cite book
|author = Laurence M. Harwood, Christopher J. Moody

|publisher=Wiley, Blackwell
|issue = of}}</ref> A classic example would be a distillation involving the distillate travelling from one glass bulb to another, without the need for a condenser separating the two chambers. This technique is often used for compounds which are unstable at high temperatures or to purify small amounts of compound. The advantage is that the heating temperature can be considerably lower (at reduced pressure) than the boiling point of the liquid at standard pressure, and the distillate only has to travel a short distance before condensing. A short path ensures that little compound is lost on the sides of the apparatus. The [[Kugelrohr]] is a kind of a short path distillation apparatus which often contain multiple chambers to collect distillate fractions.

===Zone distillation===

Zone distillation is a distillation process in long container with partial melting of refined matter in moving liquid zone and condensation of vapor in the solid phase at condensate pulling in cold area. The process is worked in theory. When zone heater is moving from the top to the bottom of the container then solid condensate with irregular impurity distribution is forming. Then most pure part of the condensate may be extracted as product. The process may be iterated many times by moving (without turnover) the received condensate to the bottom part of the container on the place of refined matter. The irregular impurity distribution in the condensate (that is efficiency of purification) increases with number of repetitions of the process.
Zone distillation is a distillation analog of zone recrystallization. Impurity distribution in the condensate is described by known equations of zone recrystallization with various numbers of iteration of process <U+2013> with replacement distribution efficient k of crystallization on separation factor <U+03B1> of distillation. (Literature: Kravchenko, A.I. Zone distillation: a new method of refining // Problems of atomic science and technology, 2011. <U+2013> N. 6 <U+2013> Series: <U+201C>Vacuum, pure materials, superconductors<U+201D> (19). <U+2013> P. 24-26. [in Russian]. <U+2013> [http://vant.kipt.kharkov.ua])

===Other types===
*The process of [[reactive distillation]] involves using the reaction vessel as the still. In this process, the product is usually significantly lower-boiling than its reactants. As the product is formed from the reactants, it is vaporized and removed from the reaction mixture. This technique is an example of a continuous vs. a batch process; advantages include less downtime to charge the reaction vessel with starting material, and less workup.
*[[Catalytic distillation]] is the process by which the reactants are catalyzed while being distilled to continuously separate the products from the reactants. This method is used to assist equilibrium reactions reach completion.
*[[Pervaporation]] is a method for the separation of mixtures of liquids by partial vaporization through a non-porous [[Artificial membrane|membrane]].
*[[Extractive distillation]] is defined as distillation in the presence of a miscible, high boiling, relatively non-volatile component, the solvent, that forms no azeotrope with the other components in the mixture.
*[[Flash evaporation]] (or partial evaporation) is the partial [[vaporization]] that occurs when a saturated liquid stream undergoes a reduction in pressure by passing through a throttling [[valve]] or other throttling device. This process is one of the simplest unit operations, being equivalent to a distillation with only one equilibrium stage.
*Codistillation is distillation which is performed on mixtures in which the two compounds are not miscible.

The unit process of [[evaporation]] may also be called "distillation":
*In [[rotary evaporation]] a vacuum distillation apparatus is used to remove bulk [[solvent]]s from a sample. Typically the vacuum is generated by a water [[aspirator]] or a [[membrane pump]].
*In a [[kugelrohr]] a short path distillation apparatus is typically used (generally in combination with a (high) vacuum) to distill high boiling (> 300 <U+00B0>C) compounds. The apparatus consists of an oven in which the compound to be distilled is placed, a receiving portion which is outside of the oven, and a means of rotating the sample. The vacuum is normally generated by using a high vacuum pump.

Other uses:
*[[Dry distillation]] or [[destructive distillation]], despite the name, is not truly distillation, but rather a [[chemical reaction]] known as [[pyrolysis]] in which solid substances are heated in an inert or [[redox|reducing]] atmosphere and any volatile fractions, containing high-boiling liquids and products of pyrolysis, are collected. The destructive distillation of [[wood]] to give [[methanol]] is the root of its common name <U+2013> ''wood alcohol''.
*[[Freeze distillation]] is an analogous method of purification using [[freezing]] instead of evaporation. It is not truly distillation, but a [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]] where the product is the [[mother liquor]], and does not produce products equivalent to distillation. This process is used in the production of [[American-style lager#Ice beer|ice beer]] and [[ice wine]] to increase ethanol and [[sugar]] content, respectively. It is also used to produce [[Applejack (beverage)|applejack]]. Unlike distillation, freeze distillation concentrates poisonous congeners rather than removing them.

==Azeotropic distillation==
{{Main|Azeotropic distillation}}
Interactions between the components of the solution create properties unique to the solution, as most processes entail nonideal mixtures, where [[Raoult's law]] does not hold. Such interactions can result in a constant-boiling '''[[azeotrope]]''' which behaves as if it were a pure compound (i.e., boils at a single temperature instead of a range). At an azeotrope, the solution contains the given component in the same proportion as the vapor, so that evaporation does not change the purity, and distillation does not effect separation. For example, [[Ethanol|ethyl alcohol]] and [[Water (molecule)|water]] form an azeotrope of 95.6% at 78.1 <U+00B0>C.

If the azeotrope is not considered sufficiently pure for use, there exist some techniques to break the azeotrope to give a pure distillate. This set of techniques are known as '''azeotropic distillation'''. Some techniques achieve this by "jumping" over the azeotropic composition (by adding an additional component to create a new azeotrope, or by varying the pressure). Others work by chemically or physically removing or sequestering the impurity. For example, to purify ethanol beyond 95%, a drying agent or a ([[desiccant]] such as [[potassium carbonate]]) can be added to convert the soluble water into insoluble [[water of crystallization]]. [[Molecular sieve]]s are often used for this purpose as well.

Immiscible liquids, such as water and toluene, easily form azeotropes. Commonly, these azeotropes are referred to as a low boiling azeotrope because the boiling point of the azeotrope is lower than the boiling point of either pure component. The temperature and composition of the azeotrope is easily predicted from the vapor pressure of the pure components, without use of Raoult's law. The azeotrope is easily broken in a distillation set-up by using a liquid-liquid separator (a decanter) to separate the two liquid layers that are condensed overhead. Only one of the two liquid layers is refluxed to the distillation set-up.

High boiling azeotropes, such as a 20 weight percent mixture of hydrochloric acid in water, also exist. As implied by the name, the boiling point of the azeotrope is greater than the boiling point of either pure component.

To break azeotropic distillations and cross distillation boundaries, such as in the DeRosier Problem, it is necessary to increase the composition of the light key in the distillate.

===Breaking an azeotrope with unidirectional pressure manipulation===
The boiling points of components in an azeotrope overlap to form a band. By exposing an azeotrope to a vacuum or positive pressure, it's possible to bias the boiling point of one component away from the other by exploiting the differing vapour pressure curves of each; the curves may overlap at the azeotropic point, but are unlikely to be remain identical further along the pressure axis either side of the azeotropic point. When the bias is great enough, the two boiling points no longer overlap and so the azeotropic band disappears.

This method can remove the need to add other chemicals to a distillation, but it has two potential drawbacks.

Under negative pressure, power for a vacuum source is needed and the reduced boiling points of the distillates requires that the condenser be run cooler to prevent distillate vapours being lost to the vacuum source. Increased cooling demands will often require additional energy and possibly new equipment or a change of coolant.

Alternatively, if positive pressures are required, standard glassware can not be used, energy must be used for pressurization and there is a higher chance of side reactions occurring in the distillation, such as decomposition, due to the higher temperatures required to effect boiling.

A unidirectional distillation will rely on a pressure change in one direction, either positive or negative.

===Pressure-swing distillation===

{{Confusing|section|date=May 2009}}

Pressure-swing distillation is essentially the same as the unidirectional distillation used to break azeotropic mixtures, but here both positive and negative pressures may be employed. {{Clarify|date=May 2009}}

This has an important impact on the selectivity of the distillation and allows a chemist {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} to optimize a process such that fewer extremes of pressure and temperature are required and less energy is consumed. This is particularly important in commercial applications.

Pressure-swing distillation is employed during the industrial purification of [[ethyl acetate]] after its catalytic synthesis from ethanol.

==Industrial distillation==
[[File:Colonne distillazione.jpg|right|thumb|Typical industrial distillation towers]]
{{Main|Continuous distillation}}
Large scale '''industrial distillation''' applications include both batch and continuous fractional, vacuum, azeotropic, extractive, and steam distillation. The most widely used industrial applications of continuous, steady-state fractional distillation are in [[oil refinery|petroleum refineries]], [[petrochemical]] and [[chemical plant]]s and [[natural gas processing]] plants.

Industrial distillation<ref name=Perry>{{Cite book|author=Perry, Robert H. and Green, Don W.|title=[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]|edition=6th| publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1984|isbn=0-07-049479-7}}</ref><ref name=Kister>{{Cite book|author=Kister, Henry Z.|title= [[Distillation Design]]|edition=1st |publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1992|isbn=0-07-034909-6}}</ref> is typically performed in large, vertical cylindrical columns known as '''distillation towers''' or '''distillation columns''' with diameters ranging from about 65 centimeters to 16 meters and heights ranging from about 6 meters to 90 meters or more. When the process feed has a diverse composition, as in distilling [[crude oil]], liquid outlets at intervals up the column allow for the withdrawal of different ''fractions'' or products having different [[boiling points]] or boiling ranges. The "lightest" products (those with the lowest boiling point) exit from the top of the columns and the "heaviest" products (those with the highest boiling point) exit from the bottom of the column and are often called the '''bottoms'''.

[[File:Continuous Binary Fractional Distillation.PNG|left|thumb|Diagram of a typical industrial distillation tower]]
Industrial towers use [[reflux]] to achieve a more complete separation of products. Reflux refers to the portion of the condensed overhead liquid product from a distillation or fractionation tower that is returned to the upper part of the tower as shown in the schematic diagram of a typical, large-scale industrial distillation tower. Inside the tower, the downflowing reflux liquid provides cooling and condensation of the upflowing vapors thereby increasing the efficiency of the distillation tower. The more reflux that is provided for a given number of [[theoretical plate]]s, the better the tower's separation of lower boiling materials from higher boiling materials. Alternatively, the more reflux that is provided for a given desired separation, the fewer the number of theoretical plates required.

Such industrial fractionating towers are also used in air separation, producing liquid [[oxygen]], [[liquid nitrogen]], and high purity [[argon]]. Distillation of [[chlorosilane]]s also enables the production of high-purity [[silicon]] for use as a [[semiconductor]].

[[File:Bubble Cap Trays.PNG|frame|right|Section of an industrial distillation tower showing detail of trays with bubble caps]]
Design and operation of a distillation tower depends on the feed and desired products. Given a simple, binary component feed, analytical methods such as the [[McCabe-Thiele method]]<ref name=Perry/><ref name=SeaderHenley>{{Cite book|author = Seader, J. D., and Henley, Ernest J.|title = Separation Process Principles|publisher = Wiley|location = New York|year = 1998| isbn = 0-471-58626-9}}</ref> or the [[Fenske equation]]<ref name=Perry/> can be used. For a multi-component feed, [[simulation]] models are used both for design and operation. Moreover, the efficiencies of the vapor-liquid contact devices (referred to as "plates" or "trays") used in distillation towers are typically lower than that of a theoretical 100% efficient [[equilibrium stage]]. Hence, a distillation tower needs more trays than the number of theoretical vapor-liquid equilibrium stages.

In modern industrial uses, a packing material is used in the column instead of trays when low pressure drops across the column are required. Other factors that favor packing are: vacuum systems, smaller diameter columns, corrosive systems, systems prone to foaming, systems requiring low liquid holdup and batch distillation. Conversely, factors that favor plate columns are: presence of solids in feed, high liquid rates, large column diameters, complex columns, columns with wide feed composition variation, columns with a chemical reaction, absorption columns, columns limited by foundation weight tolerance, low liquid rate, large turn-down ratio and those processes subject to process surges.
[[File:Vacuum Column.jpg|thumb|left|183px|Large-scale, industrial vacuum distillation column<ref>[http://resources.schoolscience.co.uk/SPE/knowl/4/2index.htm?vacuum.html Energy Institute website page]</ref>]]
This packing material can either be random dumped packing (1<U+2013>3" wide) such as [[Raschig ring]]s or [[structured packing|structured sheet metal]]. Liquids tend to wet the surface of the packing and the vapors pass across this wetted surface, where [[mass transfer]] takes place. Unlike conventional tray distillation in which every tray represents a separate point of vapor-liquid equilibrium, the vapor-liquid equilibrium curve in a packed column is continuous. However, when modeling packed columns, it is useful to compute a number of "theoretical stages" to denote the separation efficiency of the packed column with respect to more traditional trays. Differently shaped packings have different surface areas and void space between packings. Both of these factors affect packing performance.

Another factor in addition to the packing shape and surface area that affects the performance of random or structured packing is the liquid and vapor distribution entering the packed bed. The number of [[Theoretical plate|theoretical stages]] required to make a given separation is calculated using a specific vapor to liquid ratio. If the liquid and vapor are not evenly distributed across the superficial tower area as it enters the packed bed, the liquid to vapor ratio will not be correct in the packed bed and the required separation will not be achieved. The packing will appear to not be working properly. The [[Theoretical plate|height equivalent of a theoretical plate]] (HETP) will be greater than expected. The problem is not the packing itself but the mal-distribution of the fluids entering the packed bed. Liquid mal-distribution is more frequently the problem than vapor. The design of the liquid distributors used to introduce the feed and reflux to a packed bed is critical to making the packing perform to it maximum efficiency. Methods of evaluating the effectiveness of a liquid distributor to evenly distribute the liquid entering a packed bed can be found in references.<ref name=Moore>''Random Packing, Vapor and Liquid Distribution: Liquid and gas distribution in commercial packed towers'', Moore, F., Rukovena, F., Chemical Plants & Processing, Edition Europe, August 1987, p. 11-15</ref><ref name=Spiegel>{{cite journal|last1=Spiegel|first1=L|title=A new method to assess liquid distributor quality|journal=Chemical Engineering and Processing|volume=45|pages=1011|year=2006|doi=10.1016/j.cep.2006.05.003|issue=11}}</ref> Considerable work as been done on this topic by Fractionation Research, Inc.

=== Multi-effect distillation ===
The goal of multi-effect distillation is to increase the energy efficiency of the process, for use in desalination, or in some cases one stage in the production of ultrapure water. The number of effects is proportional to the kW<U+00B7>h/m<sup>3</sup> of water recovered figure, and refers to the volume of water recovered per unit of energy compared with single-effect distillation. One effect is roughly 636&nbsp;kW<U+00B7>h/m<sup>3</sup>.

*[[Multi-stage flash distillation]] Can achieve more than 20 effects with thermal energy input, as mentioned in the article.

*[[Vapor compression evaporation]] Commercial large-scale units can achieve around 72 effects with electrical energy input, according to manufacturers.

There are many other types of multi-effect distillation processes, including one referred to as simply multi-effect distillation (MED), in which multiple chambers, with intervening heat exchangers, are employed.

==Distillation in food processing==

===Distilled beverages===

{{Main|Distilled beverage}}''

[[Carbohydrate]]-containing plant materials are allowed to ferment, producing a dilute solution of ethanol in the process. Spirits such as [[whiskey]] and [[rum]] are prepared by distilling these dilute solutions of ethanol. Components other than ethanol, including water, esters, and other alcohols, are collected in the condensate, which account for the flavor of the beverage.
