'''Oklahoma''' ([[IPA chart for English|pronounced]]: /<U+02CC>o<U+028A>kl<U+0259><U+02C8>ho<U+028A>m<U+0259>/)<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Dictionary.com | accessdate=2007-08-10 | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Oklahoma| title=Oklahoma - Definitions from Dictionary.com}}</ref> is a [[U.S. state|state]] located in the [[South Central United States|South Central region]] of the [[United States of America]]. With 3,579,212 residents in 2006, it is the 28th most populous and 20th-largest state by land area. Its name is derived from the [[Choctaw]] words ''okla'' and ''humma'', meaning "red people," and is known informally by its nickname, ''The Sooner State''.<ref name="Oklahoma's Name"/> Formed from [[Indian Territory]] on [[November 16]], [[1907]], it was the 46th state to enter the union. Its people are known as ''Oklahomans'', and its capital and largest city is [[Oklahoma City]].

A major producer of [[petroleum|oil]] and food, Oklahoma is also an important manufacturer of aircraft parts and a leader in [[biotechnology]].<ref name="Oklahoma's Economy 1"/> It has one of the fastest growing economies in the nation, leading in [[gross domestic product]] growth and ranking third among states in [[per capita]] income growth.<ref name="pci"/><ref name="GDP"/> Nearly 65 percent of Oklahomans live in the [[metropolitan area]]s of Oklahoma City and [[Tulsa]], and the cities serve as primary economic centers of the state.<ref name="Ok cities"/> Six universities ranked high for academic achievement are located in the state, and two rate among the best college sports programs in American history.<ref name="top sports"/><ref name="OK Education 6"/> 

Made up of small mountain ranges, [[prairie]], and eastern forests, Oklahoma lies in the [[Great Plains]] and [[Ozarks|Ozark Highlands]] in a region prone to [[severe weather]].<ref name="Oklahoma Terrain"/> With a prevalence of [[Germans|German]], [[Irish people|Irish]], and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] ancestry, more than 25 native languages are spoken in the state, the most in the nation.<ref name="languages"/> It is located at a confluence of three major [[cultural region]]s, historically serving as a route for [[cattle drives]], a destination for southern settlers, and a government-sanctioned [[Territories of the United States|territory]] for Native Americans. Part of a strip of [[conservative]] political views and widespread beliefs in [[Christianity]] known as the [[Bible Belt]], the state has a nearly even voter demographic, with slightly more registered voters in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].<ref name="voters"/>

==Etymology==
The name ''Oklahoma'' comes from the [[Choctaw]] phrase ''okla'' ''humma'', literally meaning ''red people''. Choctaw Chief Allen Wright suggested the name in 1866 during treaty negotiations with the federal government regarding the use of [[Indian Territory]], in which he envisioned an all-Indian state controlled by the United States Superintendent of Indian Affairs. Equivalent to the English word ''Indian'', ''okla humma'' was a phrase in the Choctaw language used to describe the Native American race as a whole. ''Oklahoma'' later became the [[de-facto]] name for Oklahoma Territory, and it was officially approved in 1890, two years after the area was opened to white settlers.<ref name="Oklahoma's Name">{{cite web| title = Chronicles of Oklahoma| first= Muriel | last=Wright | publisher = Oklahoma State University| date = June 1936 | url = http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v014/v014p156.html | accessdate = 2007-07-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | year=2007| url=http://www.state.ok.us/osfdocs/stinfo2.html | title=Oklahoma State History and Information | work=A Look at Oklahoma | publisher=Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation | accessdate=2006-06-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Merserve | first=John | year=1941 | url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v019/v019p314.html | title=Chief Allen Wright| work=Chronicles of Oklahoma | accessdate=2006-06-07}}</ref>

Usually, land was allocated to settlers on a first come, first served basis.<ref>{{cite web |year=1999|url=http://aaae.okstate.edu/proceedings/1999/Factors%20Influencing%20Enrollment.doc|title= Factors Influencing Enrollment in Agricultural Education Classes of Native American Students in Oklahoma | publisher= Oklahoma State University| format=DOC |accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref> Those who broke the rules by crossing the border into the newly opened territory before it was allowed, were said to have been crossing the border ''sooner'', leading to the term ''[[sooners]]'', which eventually became the state's official nickname.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalcowboymuseum.org/research/r_virt_landrun5.html|title= Rushes to Statehood | publisher= National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref> Delegations to make the territory into a state began near the turn of the 19th century, when the Curius Act abolished all tribal jurisdiction in Indian Territory. Failed attempts to create an all-Indian state named ''Oklahoma'', and a later attempt to create an all-Indian state named ''[[Sequoyah (historically proposed U.S. state)|Sequoyah]]'' failed, but the Sequoyah Statehood Convention of 1905 eventually laid the groundwork for the Oklahoma Statehood Convention, which took place two years later.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.willrogers.com/new/articles/exhibits/Sequoyah_Centennial/Sequoyah_exhibit.html|title= Clem Rogers | publisher= Will Rogers Museum Association| accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref> On [[November 16]], [[1907]], Oklahoma was established as the 46th state in the Union.

The new state became a focal point for the emerging [[oil industry]], as discoveries of oil pools prompted towns to grow rapidly in population and wealth. Tulsa eventually became known as the "[[Oil Capital of the World]]" for most of the 20th century, and oil investments fueled much of the state's early economy.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.tulsalibrary.org/tulsahistory/communities.htm#tul| title= Tulsa Area History |publisher= Tulsa County Library| accessdate=2007-04-25}}</ref> In 1927, Oklahoma businessman [[Cyrus Avery]], known the "Father of Route 66," began a campaign to create [[Route 66]].

During the 1930s, parts of the state began feeling the consequences of poor farming practices, drought, and high winds. Known as the [[Dust Bowl]], areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty.<ref>{{cite web | date=[[2005-08-05]]|url=http://www.ccccok.org/museum/dustbowl.html|title= 1930s Dust Bowl | publisher= Cimarron County Chamber of Commerce| accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref> Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent. In response, dramatic efforts in [[soil conservation|soil]] and [[water conservation]] led to massive flood control systems and dams, creating hundreds of [[reservoirs]] and man-made lakes. By the 1960s, more than 200 man-made lakes had been created, the most in the nation.<ref>{{cite web | year=2007|url=http://www.history.com/states.do?action=detail&state=OK&contentType=State_Generic&contentId=54146|title= History of the States: Oklahoma, The Sooner State | publisher= [[The History Channel]]| accessdate=2007-08-09}}</ref><ref name="Oklahoma Terrain"/>

In 1995, Oklahoma City became the scene of one of the worst acts of terrorism ever committed in American history. The [[Oklahoma City bombing]] of [[April 19]], [[1995]], in which [[Timothy McVeigh]] and [[Terry Nichols]] detonated an explosive outside of the [[Alfred P.

===Branches===
{{seealso|Governor of Oklahoma|Oklahoma Legislature|Oklahoma Supreme Court}}

The [[Oklahoma Legislature|Legislature of Oklahoma]] consists of the [[Oklahoma Senate|Senate]] and the [[Oklahoma House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. As the lawmaking branch of the state government, it is responsible for raising and distributing the money necessary to run the government. The Senate has 48 members serving four-year terms, while the House has 101 members with two year terms. The state has a term limit for its legislature that restricts any one person to a total of twelve cumulative years service between both legislative branches.<ref name="Oklahoma Government 2"/><ref>{{cite web | publisher=U. S. Term Limits| accessdate=2007-08-09 | url=http://www.ustl.org/leglong.html| title=Legislative Longevity Limits}}</ref>

Oklahoma's judicial branch consists of the [[Oklahoma Supreme Court]], the [[Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals]], and 77 District Courts that each serves one county. The Oklahoma judiciary also contains two independent courts: a Court of [[Impeachment]] and the [[Oklahoma Court on the Judiciary]]. Oklahoma has two courts of last resort: the state Supreme Court hears civil cases, and the state Court of Criminal Appeals hears criminal cases. Judges of those two courts, as well as the Court of Civil Appeals are appointed by the Governor upon the recommendation of the state Judicial Nominating Commission, and are subject to a [[non-partisan]] retention vote on a six-year rotating schedule.<ref name= "Oklahoma Government 2">{{cite web | date=[[2007-06-07]] | publisher=Netstate| accessdate=2007-08-01 | url=http://www.netstate.com/states/government/ok_government.htm| title=Oklahoma State Government}}</ref>
[[Image:Senate_chamber.jpg|thumb|right|The Oklahoma Senate chamber houses the operations of the [[Oklahoma Senate]].]]
The executive branch consists of the [[Governor of Oklahoma|Governor]], his staff, and other elected officials. The principle head of government, the Governor is the chief executive of the Oklahoma executive branch, serving as the [[ex officio]] [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Oklahoma National Guard]] when not called into [[Federal]] use and reserving the power to [[veto]] bills passed through the Legislature. The responsibilities of the Executive branch include submitting the budget, ensuring that state laws are enforced, and ensuring peace within the state is preserved.<ref>{{cite web | date=[[1995-12-01]] | publisher=Governor's Commission| accessdate=2007-08-06 | url=http://www.oklaosf.state.ok.us/osfdocs/gvcmmsh2.html| title=Report of the Governor's Commission on Government Performance}}</ref>

=== Local government ===
The state is divided into 77 [[County (United States)|counties]] that govern locally, each headed by a three member council of elected commissioners, a tax assessor, clerk, [[court clerk]], [[treasurer]], and [[sheriff]].<ref>{{cite web | date=[[2006-01-06]] | publisher=Government of Oklahoma| accessdate=2007-08-01 | url=http://www.state.ok.us/osfdocs/county.html| title=List of County Officers}}</ref> While each [[municipality]] operates as a separate and independent local government with legislative and judicial power, county governments maintain jurisdiction over both incorporated cities and non-incorporated areas within their boundaries, but have no legislative or judicial power. Both county and municipal governments collect taxes, employ a separate police force, hold elections, and operate emergency response services within their jurisdiction.<ref name="citygov"/><ref>{{cite news |first=Don|last=Diehl| url=http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?BRD=2754&dept_id=573976&newsid=18622071&PAG=461&rfi=9| date=[[2007-07-24]]|title= Metro About Jenks population figures . . . doubled in size since 2000 census | publisher= Neighbor Newspapers | accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref> Other local government units include [[school districts]], technology center districts, community college districts, rural fire departments, rural water districts, and other special use districts.

Thirty-nine Native American tribal governments are based in Oklahoma, each holding limited powers within designated areas. While [[Indian reservations]] typical in most of the United States are not present in Oklahoma, tribal governments hold land granted during the Indian Territory era, but with limited jurisdiction and no control over state governing bodies such as municipalities and counties. Tribal governments are recognized by the United States as quasi-sovereign entities with executive, judicial, and legislative powers over tribal members and functions, but are subject to the authority of the [[United States Congress]] to revoke or withhold certain powers, and are required to submit a constitution and any subsequent amendments to the United States Congress for approval.<ref>{{cite news |first=Robert|last=Henry| url=http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=61934| date=[[1989-03-22]]|title= Oklahoma Attorney General's Opinions: Question Submitted by: The Honorable Enoch Kelly Haney, Oklahoma State Senate| publisher= The Oklahoma State Courts Network | accessdate=2007-08-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Lindsay|last=Robertson|url=http://thorpe.ou.edu/guide/robertson.html| year=2001|title= Native Americans and the Law: Native Americans Under Current United States Law| publisher= [[University of Oklahoma]]| accessdate=2007-08-21}}</ref>

Oklahoma law divides municipalities into two categories: cities, defined as having more than 1,000 residents, and towns, with under 1,000 residents. Both have [[legislative]], [[judicial]], and public power within their boundaries, but cities can choose between a [[mayor-council]], [[council-manager]], or [[strong mayor]] form of government, while towns operate through an elected officer system.<ref name="citygov">{{cite web |year=2005| url= http://www.odl.state.ok.us/almanac/2005/12-muni.pdf | title=Oklahoma Municipal Government | publisher=Oklahoma Department of Libraries | format=pdf| accessdate=2007-08-07}}</ref>
