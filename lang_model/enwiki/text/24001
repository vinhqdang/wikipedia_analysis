'''Athanasius Kircher''' (sometimes erroneously spelled '''Kirchner''') was a 17th century [[Germany|German]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[scholar]] who published around 40 works, most notably in the fields of [[Orientalism|oriental studies]], [[geology]], and [[medicine]]. He also invented the first [[megaphone]]. 

He made an early study of [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s, and has been considered the founder of [[Egyptology]].<ref name="Woods"/> One of the first people to observe microbes through a [[microscope]], he was thus ahead of his time in proposing that the [[Black Death|plague]] was caused by an infectious [[microorganism]] and in suggesting effective measures to prevent the spread of the disease.  

Kircher has been compared to [[Leonardo da Vinci]] for his inventiveness and the breadth and depth of his work. A scientific star in his day, towards the end of his life he was eclipsed by the [[rationalism]] of [[Ren<U+00E9> Descartes]] and others. In the late 20th century, however, the [[aesthetic]] qualities of his work again began to be appreciated.  One scholar, Edward W. Schmidt, has called him "the last [[Renaissance man]]".

==Life==
Kircher was born on [[May 2]] in either [[1601]] or [[1602]] (he himself did not know) in [[Geisa]], [[Buchonia]], near [[Fulda]], currently [[Hesse]], [[Germany]].   From his birthplace he took the epithets ''Bucho, Buchonius'' and ''Fuldensis'' which he sometimes added to his name.  He attended the Jesuit College in Fulda from 1614 to 1618, when he joined the order himself as a [[Seminary|seminarian]].

The youngest of nine children, Kircher was a precocious youngster who was taught [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] by a [[rabbi]] {{Fact|date=August 2007}}in addition to his studies at school. He studied [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] at [[Paderborn]], but fled to [[Cologne]] in 1622 to escape advancing [[Protestant]] forces. {{Fact|date=August 2007}} On the journey, he narrowly escaped death after falling through the ice crossing the frozen [[Rhine]]<U+2014> one of several occasions on which his life was endangered.  Later, travelling to [[Heiligenstadt]], he was caught and nearly [[hanging|hanged]] by a party of Protestant soldiers. {{Fact|date=August 2007}} 

At Heiligenstadt, he taught [[mathematics]], Hebrew and [[Aramaic language|Syriac]], and produced a show of [[firework]]s and moving scenery for the visiting [[Prince-Elector|Elector]] [[Archbishop of Mainz]], showing early evidence of his interest in [[mechanics|mechanical device]]s. He joined the [[Catholic priest|priesthood]] in 1628 and became professor of [[ethics]] and [[mathematics]] at the [[University of W<U+00FC>rzburg]], where he also taught Hebrew and Syrian.  From 1628, he also began to show an interest in Egyptian hieroglyphs.

Kircher published his first book (the ''Ars Magnesia'', reporting his research on [[magnetism]]) in 1631, but the same year he was driven by the continuing [[Thirty Years' War]] to the papal [[University of Avignon]] in [[France]].  In 1633, he was called to [[Vienna]] by the [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor]] to succeed [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] as Mathematician to the [[Habsburg]] court.  On the intervention of [[Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc]], the order was rescinded and he was sent instead to [[Rome]] to continue with his scholarly work, but he had already set off for Vienna. 

On the way, his ship was blown off-course and he arrived in Rome before he knew of the changed decision.  He based himself in the city for the rest of his life, and from 1638, he taught mathematics, [[physics]] and [[oriental language]]s at the [[Collegio Romano]] for several years before being released to devote himself to research. He studied [[malaria]] and the [[Black Death|plague]],  amassing a collection of [[Archaeology|antiquities]], which he exhibited along with devices of his own creation in the [[Museum Kircherianum]].

In 1661, Kircher discovered the ruins of a [[Church (building)|church]] said to have been constructed by [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Constantine]] on the site of [[Saint Eustace]]'s vision of [[Jesus Christ]] in a stag's horns. He raised money to pay for the church<U+2019>s reconstruction as the ''Santuario della Mentorella'', and his heart was buried in the church on his death.

==Works==
Kircher published a large number of substantial books on a very wide variety of subjects, such as [[Egyptology]], [[geology]], and [[music theory]]. His [[Syncretism|syncretic]] approach paid no attention to the boundaries between disciplines which are now conventional: his ''Magnes'', for example, was ostensibly a discussion of [[magnetism]], but also explored other forms of attraction such as [[gravity]] and [[love]]. Perhaps Kircher's best-known work today is his ''[[Oedipus Aegyptiacus]]'' (1652<U+2013>54) a vast study  of Egyptology and [[comparative religion]]. His books, written in [[Latin]], had a wide circulation in the 17th century, and they contributed to the dissemination of scientific information to a broader circle of readers. But Kircher is not now considered to have made any significant original contributions, although a number of discoveries and inventions (e.g., the [[magic lantern]]) have sometimes been mistakenly attributed to him.<ref>"Kircher, Athanasius." Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica from ''Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica 2007 Ultimate Reference Suite''. (2008).</ref>

===Egyptology===
Kircher was acknowledged as his era's greatest student of [[Ancient Egypt]]. While some of his notions are long discredited, portions of his work have been valuable to later scholars; Kircher helped pioneer Egyptology as a field of serious study.

[[Image:Kirchercopticalpha.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Coptic language|Coptic]] alphabet, from ''Prodromus coptus sive aegyptiacus'']]

Kircher's interest in Egyptology began in 1628 when he became intrigued by a collection of hieroglyphs in the library at [[Speyer]]. He learned [[Coptic language|Coptic]] in 1633 and published the first grammar of that language in 1636, the
''Prodromus coptus sive aegyptiacus''. In the ''Lingua aegyptiaca restituta'' of 1643, he argued that [[Coptic language|Coptic]] was not a separate language, but the last development of [[Egyptian language|ancient Egyptian]]. He also recognised the relationship between the [[hieratic]] and hieroglyphic scripts.

In ''Oedipus Aegyptiacus'' he argued, under the impression of the ''[[Hieroglyphica]]'', that [[Egyptian language|ancient Egyptian]] was the language spoken by [[Adam and Eve]], that [[Hermes Trismegistus]] was [[Moses]], and that hieroglyphs were [[occult]] [[symbol]]s which "cannot be translated by words, but expressed only by marks, characters and figures."  This led him to translate simple hieroglyphic texts now known to read as ''<u>d</u>d W<u>s</u>r'' ("Osiris says") as "The treachery of Typhon ends at the throne of Isis; the moisture of nature is guarded by the vigilance of Anubis"{{Fact|date=July 2008}}. Kircher apparently fooled himself (as well as some contemporaries) into believing that he could read the hieroglyphics, but his "translations" were largely figments of his own imagination, having little to do with the actual text.

Although his approach to deciphering the texts was based on a fundamental misconception, Kircher did pioneer serious study of hieroglyphs, and the data which he collected were later used by [[Champollion]] in his successful efforts to decode the script.  Kircher himself was alive to the possibility of the hieroglyphs constituting an [[alphabet]]; he included in his proposed system (incorrect) derivations of the [[Greek alphabet]] from 21 hieroglyphs. He was actively involved in the erection of Obelisks on Roman squares, often adding fantastic "hieroglyphs" of his own design in the blank areas that are now puzzling to modern scholars.

===Sinology===
[[Image:Kircherchinamap.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Map of China from ''China Illustrata'']]

Kircher had an early interest in [[China]], telling his superior in 1629 that he wished to become a [[missionary]] to the country.  His ''China Illustrata'' (1667) was an encyclopedia of China, which combined accurate [[cartography]] with mythical elements, such as [[dragon]]s. The work emphasised the Christian elements of Chinese history, both real and imagined: he noted the early presence of [[Nestorian]]s, but also claimed that the Chinese were descended from the sons of [[Ham, son of Noah|Ham]], that [[Confucius]] was Hermes Trismegistus/Moses and that the [[Chinese character]]s were corrupted hieroglyphs. In his system, [[ideogram]]s were inferior to hieroglyphs because they referred to specific ideas rather than to mysterious complexes of ideas, while the signs of the [[Maya civilization#Writing system|Maya]] and [[Aztec]]s were yet lower [[pictogram]]s which referred only to objects. [[Umberto Eco]] comments that this idea reflected and supported the European attitude to the Chinese and native American civilisations;

"China was presented not as an unknown barbarian to be defeated but as a prodigal son who should return to the home of the common father". (p. 69)

===Geology===
[[Image:Kircherearthfires.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Kircher's model of the [[Earth]]'s internal fires, from ''[[Mundus Subterraneus]]'']]
[[Image:MundusSubterraneus.jpg|thumb|left|Giant fossil bones were ascribed to giant human races in ''Mundus subterraneus'']]
On a visit to [[southern Italy]] in 1638, the ever-curious Kircher was lowered into the [[Volcano|crater]] of [[Vesuvius]], then on the brink of eruption, in order to examine its interior. He was also intrigued by the subterranean rumbling which he heard at the [[Strait of Messina]]. His geological and geographical investigations culminated in his ''[[Mundus Subterraneus]]'' of 1664, in which he suggested that the [[tide]]s were caused by water moving to and from a subterranean [[ocean]].

Kircher was also puzzled by [[fossil]]s. He understood that some were the remains of [[animal]]s which had turned to stone, but ascribed others to human invention or to the spontaneous generative force of the [[Soil|earth]]. He ascribed large bones to giant races of humans.<ref>Palmer, Douglas (2005) Earth Time: Exploring the Deep Past from Victorian England to the Grand Canyon. Wiley, Chichester. ISBN 9780470022214</ref> Not all the objects which he was attempting to explain were in fact fossils, hence the diversity of explanations.

===Medicine===
Kircher took a notably modern approach to the study of [[disease]]s, as early as 1646 using a [[microscope]] to investigate the [[blood]] of [[Black Death|plague]] victims. In his ''Scrutinium Pestis'' of 1658, he noted the presence of "little worms" or "[[animalcules]]" in the blood, and concluded that the disease was caused by [[microorganism]]s. The conclusion was correct, although it is likely that what he saw were in fact [[red blood cell|red]] or [[white blood cell|white]] [[blood cell]]s and not the plague agent, [[Yersinia pestis]]. He also proposed [[hygiene|hygienic]] measures to prevent the spread of disease, such as isolation, [[quarantine]], burning clothes worn by the infected and wearing [[facemask]]s to prevent the inhalation of [[germ]]s.

===Display of screen images===
In 1646, Kircher published ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'', on the subject of the display of images on a screen using an apparatus similar to the [[magic lantern]] as developed by [[Christian Huygens]] and others. Kircher described the construction of a "catotrophic lamp" that used reflection to project images on the wall of a darkened room. Although Kircher did not invent the device, he made improvements over previous models, and suggested methods by which exhibitors could use his device. Much of the significance of his work arises from Kircher's rational approach towards the demystification of projected images.<ref>{{cite book

Previously such images had been used in Europe to mimic supernatural appearances (Kircher himself cites the use of displayed images by the rabbis in the court of [[King Solomon]]). Kircher stressed that exhibitors should take great care to inform spectators that such images were purely naturalistic, and not magical in origin.

===Other===
[[Image:Kirchermagneticclock.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Kircher's magnetic clock]]

Kircher constructed a [[magnetism|magnetic]] clock, the mechanism of which he explained in his ''Magnes'' (1641). The device had originally been invented by another Jesuit, Fr. [[Linus of Liege]], and was described by an acquaintance of Line's in 1634. Kircher's patron Peiresc had claimed that the clock's motion supported the [[Copernican]] cosmological model, the argument being that the magnetic sphere in the clock was caused to rotate by the magnetic force of the [[sun]]. Kircher's model disproved the theory, showing that the motion could be produced by a [[water clock]] in the base of the device.

Other machines designed by Kircher include an [[aeolian harp]], [[automaton]]s such as a statue which spoke and listened via a [[speaking tube]], a [[perpetual motion machine]], or a [[Katzenklavier|cat piano]] which would drive spikes into the tails of cats which yowled to specified [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]es, although he is not known to have actually constructed the instrument.  

[[Image:Kircherears.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An illustration from the discussion of hearing in ''Musurgia Universalis'', showing the [[ear]]s of a [[human]], [[cow]], [[horse]], [[dog]], [[leopard]], [[cat]], [[rat]], [[pig]], [[sheep]] and [[goose]]]]

The ''Musurgia Universalis'' (1650) sets out Kircher's views on [[music]]: he believed that the [[harmony]] of music reflected the proportions of the [[universe]].  The book includes plans for constructing water-powered [[automatic organ]]s, [[Musical notation|notation]]s of [[birdsong]] and diagrams of [[musical instrument]]s. One illustration shows the differences between the [[ear]]s of humans and other animals. In ''Phonurgia Nova'' (1673) Kircher considered the possibilities of transmitting music to remote places.

Kircher wrote against the [[Copernican]] model in his ''Magnes'' (supporting instead that of [[Tycho Brahe]]), but in his later ''Itinerarium extaticum'' (1656, revised 1671) he presented several systems, including the Copernican, as alternative possibilities.  In ''Polygraphia nova'' (1663) he proposed an artificial [[universal language]].

Kircher received a copy of the [[Voynich Manuscript]] in 1666; it was sent to him by [[Johannes Marcus Marci]] in the hope of his being able to decipher it. The manuscript remained in the Collegio Romano until [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy]] annexed the [[papal states]] in 1870.

In 1675, he published ''Arca No<U+00EB>'', the results of his research on the biblical [[Noah's Ark|Ark of Noah]]&mdash; following the [[Counter-Reformation]], [[allegorical interpretation]] was giving way to the study of the Old Testament as literal truth among Scriptural scholars.  Kircher analyzed the dimensions of the Ark; based on the number of species known to him (excluding insects and other forms thought to [[spontaneous generation|arise spontaneously]]), he calculated that overcrowding would not have been a problem. He also discussed the logistics of the Ark voyage, speculating on whether extra livestock was brought to feed carnivores and what the daily schedule of feeding and caring for animals must have been.

==Influence==
For most of his professional life, Kircher was one of the scientific stars of the world: according to historian Paula Findlen, he was "the first scholar with a global reputation". His importance was twofold: to the results of his own [[experiment]]s and research he added information gleaned from his correspondence with over 760 scientists, physicians and above all his fellow Jesuits in all parts of the globe. The ''[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]'' calls him a "one-man intellectual clearing house". His works, illustrated to his orders, were extremely popular, and he was the first scientist to be able to support himself through the sale of his books. Towards the end of his life his stock fell, as the [[rationalism|rationalist]] [[Ren<U+00E9> Descartes|Cartesian]] approach began to dominate (Descartes himself described Kircher as "more quacksalver than savant").  
 
==In culture==
Thereafter, Kircher was largely neglected until the late 20th century. One writer attributes his rediscovery to the similarities between his eclectic approach and [[postmodernism]]: "at the start of the 21st century Kircher's taste for [[trivia]], deception and wonder is back<U+201D>; "Kircher's postmodern qualities include his subversiveness, his [[celebrity]], his [[technology|technomania]] and his bizarre [[eclecticism]]".<ref>http://www.safran-arts.com/42day/history/h4may/02kirxer.html</ref>

In his book ''For Lust of Knowing'', Robert Irwin calls Kircher "one of the last scholars aspiring to know everything", adding that the philosopher Leibniz was probably ''the'' last.

As few of Kircher's works have been translated, the contemporary emphasis has been on their [[aesthetic]] qualities rather than their actual content, and a succession of exhibitions have highlighted the beauty of their illustrations.  Historian Anthony Grafton has said that "the staggeringly strange dark continent of Kircher's work [is] the setting for a [[Borges]] story that was never written", while [[Umberto Eco]] has written about Kircher in his novel ''[[The Island of the Day Before]]'', as well as in his non-fiction works ''The Search for the Perfect Language'' and ''Serendipities''. The contemporary artist [[Cyb<U+00E8>le Varela]] has paid tribute to Kircher in her exhibition ''Ad Sidera per Athanasius Kircher'', held in the [[Collegio Romano]], in the same place where the [[Museum Kircherianum]] was. 

[[Ring of Fire series|Ring of Fire]], a series of [[alternate history]] novels, employs Fr. Kircher in a variety of short stories and as a backdrop character for the exposition of religious strife during the [[Thirty Years' War]] in the novels {{34TGA|i}} and {{34TBC|i}}. In the former his role is relatively minor, as he steps in as curate of {{16inst|Saint Mary's Parish}} for the parish priest &mdash; the newly named ''last resort'' Ambassador of the embattled and newly organized {{USE}} to the [[Most Serene Republic of Venice]] &mdash; {{16char|Larry|Mazzare|p=Fr. Lawrence Mazarre}}. He plays a larger role in {{34TBC|o}} in which he forms part of a Jesuit information network that helps resolve the personal and political concerns of the staunchly Catholic heroine, Archduchess {{16CHAR|s=Austria, Maria Anna of, Archduchess|p=Maria Anna of Austria}} and the aid she receives in her flight from citizens and government functionaries of the {{SoTF|p=State of Thuringia-Franconia}}.

The '''Athanasius Kircher Society''' had a [[weblog]] devoted to unusual ephemera, which very occasionally relate to Kircher.<ref>[http://www.kirchersociety.org/blog/?page_id=4 Athanasius Kircher Society Charter]{{Dead link|date=February 2009}}</ref>
