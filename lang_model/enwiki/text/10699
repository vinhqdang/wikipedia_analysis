'''Michael Peter Balzary''' (born [[October 16]], [[1962]]), more commonly known by the [[stage name]] '''Flea''', is an [[United States|American]] [[bassist]], [[trumpet]] player, and occasional [[actor]]. He is best known as the bassist and founding member of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. His work with the band incorporates several musical styles, ranging from aggressive [[Slapping|slap bass]], to more subdued and melodic techniques. Aside from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, he has collaborated with many artists, including [[Jane's Addiction]] and [[Alanis Morissette]]. Drawing influences from [[funk]] and [[punk rock]], Flea centers his bass playing on simplicity and minimalism, viewing complexity as something that should be used in moderation. 

Originally a [[trumpet]] prodigy, Flea first learned to play bass in high school after being taught by close friend and future Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist [[Hillel Slovak]], who needed a bassist for his band [[What Is This?|Anthym]]. Flea joined the group, but left after several months to play for the punk rock group [[Fear (band)|Fear]]. He rejoined Slovak to form an intended one-off band along with fellow high school alumni [[Anthony Kiedis]] and [[Jack Irons]] that would eventually become the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Flea has made forays into acting, appearing in numerous films such as ''[[Thrashin']]'' (1986) and ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' (1998).

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Flea was born in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] on [[October 16]], [[1962]]. His father, Mick Balzary, was an avid fisherman who would often take him fishing.<ref name=fcinterview>{{cite web|url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=DYzpn6vLBgo|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Fan Club Interview, 1989|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref> When Flea was five, his family relocated to [[Rye (city), New York|Rye]], [[New York]] for his father's job.<ref name=apterp19>Apter, 2004. p. 19</ref> In 1971, his parents divorced and his father returned to Australia. Flea and his siblings stayed with their mother Patricia, who soon remarried to a jazz musician and bassist.<ref name=apterp19/> Flea's stepfather frequently invited musicians to his house and [[jam session]]s would often take place. The family relocated again to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and Flea became fascinated with [[trumpet]].<ref name=apterpg20>Apter, 2004. p. 20</ref><ref name=AMGbio>{{Cite web|url=http://wm03.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:0bfyxqt5ld0e~T1|title=Biography of Flea|author=Prato, Greg|accessdate=2007-12-15|publisher=[[All Music Guide]]}}</ref> His teachers considered him to be a prodigy, paralleled only by musician [[Herb Alpert]], who also attended Fairfax High.<ref name=VH1behindthemusic>{{cite episode | title = [http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/behind_the_music/51363/episode_about.jhtml Red Hot Chili Peppers] | series = [[Behind the Music]] | network = [[VH1]] | airdate = 1999-05-30 | accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref>  Furthermore, he had no interest in [[rock music]] at the time and idolized jazz musicians like [[Miles Davis]], [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Dizzy Gillespie]].<ref name=apterpg20/> 

His stepfather, however, was an "aggressive alcoholic" who eventually became involved in shoot-outs with police. "I was raised in a very violent, alcoholic household", Flea later said, "I grew up being terrified of my parents, particularly my father figures. It caused [me] a lot of trouble later in life."<ref name=apterpg21>Apter, 2004. p. 21</ref> In order to cope with this situation, Flea started to experiment heavily in [[marijuana]] at the age of thirteen, which he started smoking on a daily basis.<ref name=apterpgs20>Apter, 2004. pp. 22&ndash;23</ref>

Flea attended [[Fairfax High School (Los Angeles)|Fairfax High School]], and was somewhat of an outcast due to his taste in music.<ref name=apterpgs20/> However, he soon met [[Anthony Kiedis]], and after a fight, the two became best friends.<ref name=apterpg34>Apter, 2004. p. 34</ref> Kiedis recalled, "We were drawn to each other by the forces of mischief and love and we became virtually inseparable. We were both social outcasts. We found each other and it turned out to be the longest-lasting friendship of my life."<ref name=apterpg35>Apter, 2004. p. 35</ref> Kiedis became a significant influence on Flea, turning him on to rock music, particularly punk rock.<ref name=apterpg35/> Flea soon adopted his nickname, given to him by Kiedis while the two were on a [[skiing]] trip in reference to his jumpy and capricious nature.<ref name=apterpg35/>

===1980&ndash;1984: Formation of the Red Hot Chili Peppers===
Flea was also close friends with [[Hillel Slovak]], the guitarist of a local band called Anthym. The band's original bassist was deemed unsatisfactory, so Slovak began teaching Flea to play [[Bass guitar|bass]].<ref name=apterpgs40>Apter, 2004. pp. 40&ndash;45</ref> Following several months of commitment to the instrument, Flea developed proficiency and joined the group. Shortly thereafter, Anthym entered a local [[Battle of the Bands]] contest and won second place.<ref name=apterpgs40/> During his tenure with the group, Flea began to develop a style of [[slapping|slap bass]] that would become prominent in future Red Hot Chili Peppers songs. Anthym started to play at local nightclubs, despite the fact that the members were all underage. Flea, Slovak, and Kiedis became best friends, and often partook in the recreational use of [[LSD]], [[heroin]], [[cocaine]], and [[Amphetamine|speed]].<ref name=apterpgs40/> 

The threesome became fans of the growing punk rock movement that was occurring in Los Angeles at the time. Flea went from despising the genre to listening to it exclusively: "The beautiful thing about punk rock was the intensity, the energy. And punk deflated the whole bloated rock-star thing. I think that musicians who don't pay attention to punk have a gap in their knowledge that makes it difficult to communicate in this day in age."<ref name=apterpgs40/> Anthym changed their name to [[What Is This?]], and rapidly became a local club favorite<U+2014>frequently attracting more than thirty people per show. The band was faltering internally however, and Flea left the group to play bass for a well-established L.A. punk rock group called [[Fear (band)|Fear]].<ref name=apterpgs50>Apter, 2004. pp. 50&ndash;56</ref> Although Fear was a thriving act, Flea was discontent in the band and left shortly after joining.<ref name=apterpgs50/> He then successfully auditioned for the role of bassist in the British [[post-punk]] group [[Public Image Ltd.]], but rejected the offer; he later admitted that the only reason he auditioned was to jam with the band's front man [[John Lydon]].<ref name=apterpgs50/>

Slovak, Kiedis, and Flea began to create their own music after finding inspiration in a punk-funk fusion band called [[Defunkt]].<ref name=MOJO>Page, Scarlet (July, 2004). "Red Hot Chili Peppers: The LA Punks Who Defied Death, Grunge And A Burning Crack Den". ''Mojo''.</ref> Flea, Slovak, Kiedis and former Anthym-drummer [[Jack Irons]] formed a band called Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem. The band had only one song, entitled "Out in L.A.", and was formed for the purpose of playing the song once.<ref name=apterpg60>Apter, 2004. p. 60</ref> Following the group's first show at The Rhythm Lounge, the owner of the bar asked them to return, but with two songs instead of one. After several more shows, and the addition of several songs to their repertoire, the band's name was changed to Red Hot Chili Peppers.<ref name=apterpg61>Apter, 2004. p. 61</ref><ref name=VH1behindthemusic/>

===1984&ndash;1990: First four albums===
The band's concert repertoire grew to nine songs as a result of months of playing local nightclubs and bars.<ref name=apterpg62>Apter, 2004. p. 62</ref> The Red Hot Chili Peppers entered Bijou Studios to record a demo tape and subsequently secured a record deal with [[EMI]].<ref name=VH1behindthemusic/> Irons and Slovak however, decided to leave the Chili Peppers in order to pursue a "more serious" future with What Is This?.<ref name=apterpgs70>Apter, 2004. pp. 70&ndash;74</ref> Flea ultimately respected the decision, but felt the band would be lost without them. He and Kiedis hired drummer [[Cliff Martinez]] and guitarist [[Jack Sherman]] to fill Iron's and Slovak's places, respectively.<ref name=apterpgs70/> [[Andy Gill]], formerly of [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]], agreed to produce their first album. Gill and Sherman clashed with Flea and Kiedis; they continuously argued over music style, sound, and the album's production.<ref name=apterpgs78>Apter, 2004. pp. 78&ndash;88</ref> Flea himself felt that the album was stiff and "a big mistake", but also admitted "we [he and Kiedis] were just disrespectful and obnoxious."<ref name=MOJO/> The band's eponymous debut album, [[The Red Hot Chili Peppers (album)|''The Red Hot Chili Peppers'']], was released on [[August 10]], [[1984]] to largely poor critical and commercial review.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 234&ndash;235</ref> After a relatively unfruitful tour, Sherman was fired in early 1985. Slovak, who had been contemplating a return to the Chili Peppers, rejoined the group after being encouraged by Flea.<ref name=RHCPbio>{{Cite web|url=http://wm03.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:difrxqr5ldje~T1|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Biography|author=Prato, Greg|accessdate=2007-12-15|publisher=All Music Guide}}</ref>

Funk musician [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] was hired to produce the band's second album, ''[[Freaky Styley]]''. The strong chemistry between Clinton and the Chili Peppers was felt instantly. Flea later referred to Clinton as "the warmest, kindest man in the world."<ref name=apterpg110>Apter, 2004. p. 110</ref> When ''Freaky Styley'' was released in August of 1985, however, it received only a bit more attention than ''The Red Hot Chili Peppers'' with roughly 75,000 copies sold by year end.<ref name=MOJO/> Flea was somewhat indifferent to the poor album sales as he had recently proposed to girlfriend Loesha Zeviar, who was pregnant with their child.<ref name=apterpg127>Apter, 2004. p. 127</ref> The band hired [[Michael Beinhorn]], their last resort among potential producers, to work on their next album.<ref name=aptr133>Apter, 2004. pp 130-141</ref> What Is This? had finally disbanded, and Irons returned to the Chili Peppers in mid 1986 after Martinez was fired. Flea, Slovak and Kiedis especially were involved in heavy drug use and their relationships became strained. Flea recalled that "it began to seem ugly to me and not fun; our communication was not healthy."<ref name=aptr133/> Kiedis became dependent on heroin, leaving Flea and Slovak to work on much of the album's material by themselves. Flea and Zeviar married, and she gave birth to their daughter Clara. Kiedis was briefly kicked out of the band, and given a month to rehabilitate. Kiedis completed the rehab and rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Los Angeles to record their third album ''[[The Uplift Mofo Party Plan]]''.<ref name=aptr133/> Flea has referred to the album as "the 'rockingest' record" the band has ever made.<ref name=aptr133/> ''The Uplift Mofo Party Plan'' proved to be far more successful, commercially and critically, than the Chili Peppers' preceding albums; registering at number 148 on the [[Billboard Top 200|''Billboard'' Top 100]].<ref name=billboardrhcp>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&model.vnuArtistId=5507&model.vnuAlbumId=815996|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Albums Charting|accessdate=2007-09-12|publisher=''Billboard''}}</ref> Following the ''Uplift'' tour, Slovak's drug use dramatically increased. Flea's relationship with Slovak faded, and Slovak became isolated and depressed.<ref name=MOJO/> On [[June 28]] [[1988]], Slovak was found dead of a heroin overdose. Flea reflected: "I didn't really know how to deal with that sadness, and I don't think [Kiedis] knew how to deal with it either."<ref name=MOJO/> Irons, who was taking Slovak's death particularly hard, left the group.<ref name=VH1behindthemusic/>

Flea and Kiedis took some time to collect themselves, but decided to keep the band together. Guitarist [[DeWayne "Blackbyrd" McKnight]] and drummer [[D.H. Peligro]] were added, and the band entered the studio to record a new album. McKnight soon began to create tension within the group, as his style did not mesh with the rest of the band.<ref name=Kiedis234-239>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 234</ref> Peligro was a friend of [[John Frusciante]], an eighteen year old guitarist and avid Chili Peppers fan.<ref name="rs-fricke">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/chilipeppers_tattooed_love_boys/page/1|author=Fricke, David|date=[[June 15]], [[2006]]|title=Tattooed Love Boys: After twenty-three years, nine albums, death, love, and addiction, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are at Number One for the very first time|accessdate=2007-10-02|publisher=''Rolling Stone''}}</ref> Peligro introduced Frusciante to Flea, and the three jammed together on several occasions.<ref name=apterpg178>Apter, 2004. pp. 178&ndash;190</ref> Flea was impressed with Frusciante's skill, and astonished by his knowledge of the Chili Peppers' repertoire.

Upon release, the album was met with mixed reactions from critics, but received far more commercial attention; peaking at number 58 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 200.<ref name=billboardrhcp/> After this, Flea made an appearance playing the trumpet on Jane's Addiction's 1988 album ''[[Nothing's Shocking]]''.<ref name=jans>''Nothing's Shocking'' liner notes</ref>

===1990&ndash;1998: Mainstream success and side projects===
The ensuing ''Mother's Milk'' tour put a strain on Flea's marriage. In order to make money, he needed to tour, and therefore spend time away from his family.<ref name=apterpg205>Apter, 2004. pp. 205&ndash;212</ref> Furthermore, he and Smith were arrested on charges of battery and sexual harassment after a performance on MTV's coverage of spring break;<ref name=MOJO/> charges were eventually dropped.<ref name=apterpg205/> The band was, however, attracting over three thousand people per show; ''Mother's Milk'' had been [[RIAA certification|certified]] as a [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] record in early 1990.<ref name=RIAA>{{Cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH|title=RIAA Searchable Database|publisher=[[RIAA]]|accessdate=2007-12-15}}</ref><ref name="Billboard singles">{{cite web| url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.vnuArtistId=5507&model.vnuAlbumId=815996|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Artist Chart History: Singles| publisher=''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''| accessdate=2007-12-16}}</ref> By the time Red Hot Chili Peppers returned to Los Angeles, Flea and Zeviar agreed to a separation.<ref name=apterpg205/> He tried to put the separation out of his mind by smoking marijuana and having sex with willing fans.<ref name=apterpg205/>

When the tour was over, the Red Hot Chili Peppers severed ties with EMI and signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]].<ref name=sctisswarner>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 261<U+2013>262</ref> Rick Rubin, who rejected an opportunity to produce ''The Uplift Mofo Party Plan'', agreed to produce their next album.<ref name=apterpg220>Apter, 2004. pp. 220&ndash;236</ref> Flea had largely used the principal slap bass technique on the band's preceding four albums, and decided to downplay this style in favor of more conventional, melodic bass lines.<ref name=Funkymonks>''Funky Monks'', 1991. Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.</ref> To record the album, Rubin suggested a mansion that once belonged to magician [[Harry Houdini]]. Flea felt it was "a creatively fertile situation", and decided to bring his daughter Clara with him.<ref name=apterpg220/> He and the rest of the band, excluding Smith, remained inside the house for the entire recording process. When not writing or recording the album, Flea spent a large portion of his time with Frusciante smoking large quantities of marijuana.<ref name=apterpg220/> The emotions Flea felt during the album's recording was like nothing he had ever experienced:<ref name=MOJO/>
{{cquote|When we [the band] made ''Blood Sugar'' we spent a lot of time jamming<U+2014>every day, for hours and hours. I remember during that time Anthony went off and made a movie, and for a long time it was just me, John and Chad, and we'd just go in there and play. Me and John were hitting the bong and we just rocked and grooved forever. It was the first time we went in to make a record where there wasn't this feeling of being sort of intimidated by what was going to happen.}}
When ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'' was released on [[September 24]], [[1991]], it received an overwhelmingly positive critical response. The album peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 200, and went on to sell over seven million copies in the U.S. alone.<ref name=RHCPbio/><ref name=billboardrhcp/> The album's ensuing tour was critically acclaimed<U+2014>the Chili Peppers commonly performed shows with over twenty thousand in attendance.<ref name=p282>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 282</ref> [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]]-based [[Grunge music|grunge]] band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] also toured with them during the West Coast leg of their United States tour.<ref name=p282/> The massive attention the Chili Peppers started receiving, however, caused Frusciante to feel extremely uncomfortable, and he abruptly quit the band during the Japanese leg of  the album's tour.<ref name=rollingstonearticle>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/redhotchilipeppers/articles/story/5938432/the_naked_truth|title=The Naked Truth|author=David Fricke|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=''Rolling Stone''}}</ref> The band hired guitarist [[Arik Marshall]] to complete the remaining tour dates.

Marshall was fired at the end of the tour, and the band added former [[Jane's Addiction]] guitarist [[Dave Navarro]] to record a new album. Kiedis was in the middle of a heroin relapse, which forced Flea to assume the role of lyricist, something he had not yet done. He wrote most of the song "Transcending", and the intro to "Deep Kick". Flea also wrote the lyrics to an entire song<U+2014>"Pea"<U+2014>which he both sang and played bass on.<ref name=p341>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 341&ndash;344</ref> These three songs appeared on the Chili Peppers' sixth record ''[[One Hot Minute]]'', which was released on [[September 12]], [[1995]]. The album received mixed reviews and was significantly less commercially successful than ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''.<ref name=RHCPbio/> The ''One Hot Minute'' tour was ultimately cut short due to various injuries Kiedis and Smith received, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers decided to go on hiatus.<ref name=apterpg290>Apter, 2004. pp. 290&ndash;302</ref> Flea began to practice [[yoga]], and slowly decreased his marijuana consumption.<ref name=apterpg290/> Due to the Chili Peppers' inactivity, Flea joined Navarro in a Jane's Addiction reunion tour in 1997, filling in for ex-Jane's Addiction bassist [[Eric Avery]]. Rumors spread that the band was breaking up, until Navarro stated otherwise: "I want to clarify that the Chili Peppers are not breaking up...Flea and I are more than happy to do both projects, time permitting."<ref name=apterpg290/> 

Flea also had plans to record a solo album. He asked Chili Peppers manager Lindy Goetz to help him promote the record and his future solo career.<ref name=apterpg290/> Flea eventually abandoned the idea in favor of offering his bass services to other artists. He performed on over forty records from 1995 to 1998, ranging from [[Alanis Morissette]]'s ''[[Jagged Little Pill]]'' to former [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]] bassist [[Mike Watt]]'s debut solo album ''[[Ball-Hog or Tugboat?]]''. He also worked with [[Tori Amos]] and [[Michael Stipe]] on a track for the soundtrack to the 1995 [[Johnny Depp]] film ''[[Don Juan DeMarco]]''.<ref>Apter, 2004. p. 281</ref> Navarro was fired from the Chili Peppers in 1998, and Flea questioned whether or not the Red Hot Chili Peppers would stay together: "the only way I could imagine carrying on is if we got John [Frusciante] back in the band."<ref name=pp2>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 390&ndash;395</ref> Frusciante had completed drug rehabilitation in 1997 after a severe addiction to [[heroin]] and [[crack cocaine]] left him on the brink of death.<ref name="pnt">{{cite web | last = Wilonsky | first = Robert | url = http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1996-12-12/music/blood-on-the-tracks/| title = Blood on the Tracks | publisher = ''Phoenix New Times Music'' | date = [[December 12]], [[1996]] | accessdate = 2007-06-22 }}</ref> Flea visited Frusciante in early 1998, inviting him back to the Chili Peppers; an emotional Frusciante readily accepted.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 408</ref>

===1998&ndash;present: ''Californication'', ''By the Way'' and ''Stadium Arcadium''===
The band, with Frusciante back on guitar, began writing new songs during the summer of 1998 in Flea's garage.<ref name=MOJO/> He and Kiedis were less confident in writing the album, after the disappointing results of ''One Hot Minute''.<ref name=MOJO/> Flea had also recently broken up with his girlfriend of two years, Marissa Pouw, causing him to enter a state of depression,<ref name=apterpg300>Apter, 2004. pp. 304&ndash;311</ref> which was only lifted when his daughter, Clara, comforted him after several weeks of crying.<ref name=MOJO/>

Flea was heavily influenced by [[electronica]] during the writing and recording of ''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]'' and he attempted to emulate this when writing bass lines for the album.<ref name=apterpg300/> ''Californication'' took less than two weeks to record; by contrast, ''One Hot Minute'' took over a year. When ''Californication'' was released on [[June 8]], [[1999]] it received overwhelmingly positive critical reviews and sold fifteen million copies worldwide<U+2014>more than ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''.<ref name=MOJO/> The Chili Peppers played [[Woodstock 1999]], with Flea playing completely naked<U+2014>something he would do again at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]] the same year.<ref name=apterpg300/> 

Flea felt like the public school system was seriously lacking in exposing children to music by drastically reducing, and sometimes eliminating, art related programs.<ref name=laist>{{cite web|url=http://www.laist.com/2007/05/02/fleas_circus_silverlake_music_conservatory_throws_hullabaloo_fundraiser.php|date=March, 2007|title=Flea<U+2019>s Circus: Silverlake Music Conservatory Throws Hullabaloo Fundraiser|publisher=LAist|accessdate=2008-01-26}}</ref> He founded the Silverlake Conservatory of Music, a school dedicated to help youth progress in music, because of this.<ref name=laist/><ref name=apterpg320>Apter, 2004. pp. 327&ndash;338</ref> "I just wanted to fill the void that public education has cut from their curriculum. They've dropped the ball by cutting out music programs", Flea laments, "I grew up in LA public schools and was in the music department. It was really an important thing for my life, it gave me something to hold onto, and it was an important access for me. Without music I would've gotten into a lot of trouble and there are a lot of kids like me out there. I just wanted to try to provide something like what I got."<ref name=laist/>

Red Hot Chili Peppers spent most of 2001 writing their eighth studio album, ''[[By the Way]]''.

After another two year world tour, the Chili Peppers wrote their ninth studio album ''[[Stadium Arcadium]]''.

Flea has displayed a wide variety of techniques throughout the years, ranging from his initial use of slapping and popping to the more traditional methods he has employed since ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''. Greg Prato of [[All Music Guide]] has noted that "by combining funk-style bass with psychedelic, punk, and hard rock, Flea created an original playing style that has been copied numerous times."<ref name=AMGbio/> Flea has been considered as one of the greatest bassists of all time, with Greg Tate of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' saying "if there were a Most Valuable Bass Player award given out in rock, Flea could have laid claim to that bitch ten years running."<ref name=californicationreview>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/277669/californication|title=''Californication'' review|accessdate=2008-01-16|publisher=''Rolling Stone'' magazine|author=Tate, Greg|date=June, 1999}}</ref> [[Smashing Pumpkins]] front man [[Billy Corgan]] recalls that when he first saw the Chili Peppers in 1984, "Flea was playing so aggressively that he had worn a hole in his thumb and he was literally screaming in pain in-between songs because it hurt so bad. Someone kept coming out and pouring crazy glue into the hole."<ref name=VH1behindthemusic/> Flea's sound is also determined by what type of instrument he plays. Before ''Californication'', he did not believe the actual bass held much significance: "what mattered was how you hit them [basses] and your emotional intent, and I still think that's the bottom line."<ref name=hadenandflea/> Flea currently plays a 1961 [[Fender Jazz Bass]] that he treasures for its "old wood sound".<ref name=hadenandflea/> He has contributed to the Red Hot Chili Peppers' sound not only with the bass but by playing trumpet, as well; it can be heard on several songs, such as "Subway to Venus" from their fourth album ''Mother's Milk'' or "Warlocks" from their ninth album ''Stadium Arcadium''.

===Technique===
Flea's bass playing has changed considerably throughout the years. When he joined Fear his technique centered largely around traditional [[punk rock]] bass lines,<ref name=intbass>{{Cite web|url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=JzkeyWNkhpY|title=Interview with Flea in 1988|accessdate=2008-01-16|publisher=[[VPRO]]}}</ref> however he was to change this style when the Red Hot Chili Peppers formed. He began to incorporate a "slap" bass style that drew influence largely from [[Bootsy Collins]].<ref name=apterpgs70/> However, this technique caused Flea to receive attention from the music world and was often copied, and he therefore felt it necessary to completely remove slap-bass styles from his repertoire following ''Mother's Milk''.<ref name=AMGbio/> Consequently, ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' saw a notable shift in style as it featured none of his signature technique but rather styles that focused more on traditional and melodic roots.<ref name=bassplayermag>Malandrone, Scott (October, 1995). "Flea Interview". ''Bass Player''.</ref> His intellectual beliefs on how to play the instrument was also altered: "I was trying to play simply on ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' because I had been playing too much prior to that, so I thought, 'I've really got to chill out and play half as many notes'. When you play less, it's more exciting<U+2014>there's more room for everything. If I do play something busy, it stands out, instead of the bass being a constant onslaught of notes. Space is good."<ref name=bassplayermag/> During the writing and recording of ''One Hot Minute'', Flea integrated some use of slap-bass progressions, but continued to center his technique around the philosophy of "less is more" rather than complexity: "I can't even think of anything I played that was complex [on the record]; even the slapping stuff is simple. It's original-sounding, and I'm proud of that<U+2014>but what I played was more a matter of aesthetic choice."<ref name=bassplayermag/> This led Flea to alter the way he wrote music by playing alone, instead of the [[jam session]]s that would dictate how the band conceived songs: "[''One Hot Minute''] is the least jam-oriented record we've made. I mean, we definitely jammed on the ideas, but there's only one groove on the whole album that came from a jam, 'Deep Kick'. The rest of it came from my sitting down with a guitar or bass."<ref name=bassplayermag/>

Flea became interested in [[electronica]] during the ''Californication'' era and he attempted to emulate the same atmosphere given off by [[Synthesizer|synthsesizers]] into his bass playing: "I feel the most exciting music happening is electronica, without a doubt."<ref name=apterpg300/> He ultimately decided against this, acknowledging that, aside from Frusciante, the band was not moving in the same direction.<ref name=apterpg300/> ''Californication'' also saw him incorporate more funk-driven bass lines then he had on ''One Hot Minute''. In ''By the Way'', much of the bass-lines were entirely stripped of funk. Flea felt the chords Frusciante had written were not supportive of his typical technique; furthermore, he does not feel the musical direction of the record was specifically melodic, but instead "a result of each one of us being who we are. The way we [the band] compose music is a very communal thing."<ref name=2002interview>{{Cite web|url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=R6jCs07_01U|title=2002 Interview with Flea|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=2008-01-16}}</ref>

===Influences===
Flea's stepfather was in a [[bebop]] band that frequently jammed in his presence; he, therefore, became fascinated with the trumpet soon after.<ref name=MOJO/><ref name=AMGbio/><ref name=VH1behindthemusic/> Flea credits his continued interest in music to jazz performers like [[Miles Davis]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[John Coltrane]] and [[Dizzy Gillespie]].<ref name=apterpg20/> After Kiedis introduced him to [[punk]] and [[Rock music|rock]], Flea became infatuated with artists like [[The Germs]], [[Styx (band)|Styx]], [[David Bowie]] and [[Defunkt]].<ref name=MOJO/><ref name=apterpg35/> Flea's early influences before ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' were mainly funk artists like [[Bootsy Collins]], [[Parliament]], [[Funkadelic]], [[Sly and the Family Stone]], and [[The Meters]].<ref name=influences>{{Cite web|url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=vB-BTBCZvHI|title=Flea's Influences|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=2008-01-16}}</ref> They would become a notable aspect of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' sound up to ''Mother's Milk''. Originally, Flea was given the impression by punk bands that one should play as hard and fast as they possibly could, but ultimately rejected this philosophy during ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'': "I was so into being raw [...] it was all bullshit."<ref name=hadenandflea/> On ''Californication'' and ''By the Way'', Flea drew influence from electronica, [[gothic rock]] bands like [[The Cure]] and [[Siouxsie & the Banshees]] and [[New Wave music]] rather than funk.<ref name=apterpg320/> During ''Stadium Arcadium'' he experienced another shift in interest. Instead of the melodic music he had listened to during the two previous albums, he enjoyed the work of "flashy" guitar players like [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Eddie Van Halen]], and [[Jimmy Page]], exclusively.<ref name=interview2006/>

==Film and television appearances==
[[Image:FleaBigLebowski.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Flea (far right) portrayed as one of the three German nihilists in the 1998 film ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'']]
Flea has pursued a minor acting career since the mid 1980s.  His first role was alongside the Chili Peppers, who played themselves, in the skate drama ''[[Thrashin']]'' (1986). He portrayed the character Needles in ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' (1989), though he regrets this and considered the movie to be a "multi-million dollar piece of trash."<ref name=nozemsagogo>{{Cite web|url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=Gw2SW1fIWg0|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers; Nozems-A-GoGo|publisher=VPRO|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref> He played a minor role in the 1991 [[Independent film|independent]] film ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'' as the character Budd. Flea has, more recently, made appearances in the films ''[[The Chase (1994 film)|The Chase]]'' (1994) as a monster truck driver, ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' (1997) as a musician, and ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' (1998), as a German [[Nihilism|nihilist]]. He lent his voice as the character Donnie to the animated series ''[[The Wild Thornberrys]]''.

In 1991, Red Hot Chili Peppers released a black and white film  documenting the recording of ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' called ''[[Funky Monks]]''. They have released two video concerts, ''[[Off the Map (video)|Off the Map]]'' in 2001 and ''[[Live at Slane Castle (Red Hot Chili Peppers video)|Live at Slane Castle]]'' in 2004<U+2014>the latter of which had over eighty thousand attendees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.play.com/DVD/DVD/4-/140015/Red-Hot-Chili-Peppers-Live-At-Slane-Castle/Product.html|title=Live At Slane Castle|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=Play.com}}</ref> Flea has also appeared in television broadcasts with Red Hot Chili Peppers on several occasions. Several months before Frusciante's departure in 1992, the band performed two songs on [[Saturday Night Live]]<U+2014>Kiedis felt the show was an embarrassment due to the guitarist, who purposely played out of tune and incorrectly.<ref name=scartiss300>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 300<U+2013>301</ref><ref name=apterpg290/> Later that year, the band appeared in the popular animated comedy ''[[The Simpsons]]'' on the episode "[[Krusty Gets Kancelled]]". At [[Woodstock 1994]], Kiedis proposed the band perform the first few songs in metallic suits with giant light bulbs placed on their heads.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 315&ndash;323</ref> Flea was initially reluctant but eventually agreed: "when we got to play, the energy of the whole thing took over."<ref>Apter, 2004. p. 276</ref> In 1996, he guest starred on an episode of ''[[Ben Stiller Show|The Ben Stiller Show]]''. On the episode, Flea beats Stiller in a game of basketball. For the [[Woodstock 1999|1999 Woodstock Festival]], he played the concert naked.<ref name=apterpg300/> The band has also performed on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' three times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theside.free.fr/videos/videos.php3?type=4|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Television broadcasts|accessdate=2008-01-17|publisher=The Side}}</ref>
