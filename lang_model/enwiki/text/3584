==Minnesota House of Representatives==
In November 2002, Ellison was elected to his first public office, as a member of the [[Minnesota House of Representatives]] serving House District 58B.

===Tenure===
Ellison was elected to the House of Representatives on November 7, 2006, and sworn in on January 4, 2007. He garnered national attention with his decision to use a Qur'an that once belonged to [[President Thomas Jefferson]] for [[Qur'an oath controversy of the 110th United States Congress|his reenacted swearing in ceremony]], which generated both praise and criticisms from political pundits.

At the time of his swearing in, Ellison said he intended to focus on wages, housing, "relief and justice for the middle class", and ending the U.S. involvement in the [[Iraq War]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Ellison, on verge of historic first term, unruffled by critics|agency=Associated Press|url=http://www.kare11.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=145716| date=1/3/2007 |accessdate=January 3, 2007 }}</ref> Ellison was also a vocal critic of [[Presidency of George W.

;Credit reform
[[File:Ellison-june07.JPG|thumb|right|Ellison outside the Capitol in June 2007]]
On May 3, 2007, Ellison introduced a bill to outlaw [[universal default]], the practice whereby [[credit card]] companies raise interest rates on customers if they are behind on payments to any other creditors. The bill was also supported by [[House Financial Services Committee]] chairman Rep. [[Barney Frank]]. Ellison, who described the bill as "the beginning of a whole credit reform effort we<U+2019>re going to be pursuing," also announced his interest in limiting high interest rates on credit cards and easing the process for those who have a legitimate need to file [[bankruptcy]].<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Associated Press|title= Ellison's 1st Bill To End Bad Credit Card Practice|url= http://wcco.com/local/local_story_122152004.html|date= May 2, 2007}}</ref> This provision ultimately became law in 2009 as part of the "Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights" portion of the [[Credit CARD Act of 2009]].

In an interview with the BBC's Program Outlook, on Nov. 12th 2010, Ellison was asked to describe his constituents.

===Iraq War===
After President Bush vetoed HR 1591 that provided military funding for the [[Iraq War]] because it contained timetables for withdrawal, Ellison and fellow Minnesota Rep. [[Betty McCollum]], joined House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top House Democrats in voting "no" to HR 2206 that provided the funding without any timetables. The bill passed the House on a 280 to 142 margin.<ref>{{cite news|date=May 25, 2007|title=Walz breaks rank, supports war funds|author=Brian Voerding | publisher=Winona Daily News|url=http://www.winonadailynews.com/articles/2007/05/25/news/04walz25.txt}}</ref>

Ellison joined fellow Minnesota freshman Democrat [[Tim Walz]] in opposing President [[George W.

I think we need to have a political and economic and diplomatic engagement, and we need to encourage the forces that are in Iraq to begin to resolve the violence in Iraq."<ref name="Iraq jan8"/> When asked if he would support Bush<U+2019>s call for an additional $100 billion to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Ellison said, "I want to see [the request] first, I want to actually look at it, but I'm not inclined to continue to support a war or an occupation that  he has no plans to get us out of, and which is so costly in terms of dollars and lives of American soldiers but also Iraqis."<ref name="Iraq jan8"/> The [[White House]], when asked for a reaction to the comments, referred to a previous statement by press secretary [[Tony Snow]]: "Democrats will have to decide where they stand on two issues: <U+2018>No. 1, do you want Iraq to succeed, and, if so, what does that mean? And, No. 2, do you believe in supporting the troops as you say, and how do you express that support?<U+2019>"<ref name="Iraq jan8"/>

===Bush administration===
On July 25, 2007, Ellison voted in the House Judiciary Committee to issue citations of [[Contempt of Congress]] to [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Joshua Bolten]] and former [[White House Counsel]] [[Harriet Miers]] for "failure to comply with subpoenas on [[Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy|the firings of several federal prosecutors]]".<ref name="contempt">{{cite news|title=Ellison votes with majority on contempt citations against White House aides|date=July 25, 2007|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/07/25/contemptellison/|agency=Associated Press}}</ref>

On June 28, 2007, Ellison became a cosponsor of Rep. [[Dennis Kucinich]] [[US House Resolution 333|bill to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney]] for "high crimes and misdemeanors." Ellison's spokesperson, Rick Jauert, said the effort was "largely to send a message" and that Ellison "has no illusions that this is going anywhere and that's fine. We've got more important things to do that affect people's daily lives. He basically signed on out of principle, as an expression of the importance of the rule of law <U+2014> that nobody is above the law, not even the vice president."<ref>{{cite news|title=Ellison signs as cosponsor of bill to impeach Cheney|agency=Associated Press|date=June 29, 2007|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070702002330/http://www.startribune.com/587/story/1276950.html}}</ref>

On July 8, 2007, Ellison gave a speech in [[Edina, Minnesota]], where he denounced Bush's commutation of [[Lewis Libby]]'s sentence: "If Libby gets [[Pardon#Pardons and clemency in the United States|pardoned]], then he should not have the cover of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]. He's going to have to come clean and tell the truth.

It's essentially a public-relations outreach arm for the Bush administration to reach out to the far right of the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]] movement. That's really all it is."<ref name="Southdale"/>

====Iraq====
On July 28 and 29, 2007, Ellison was among an "all-freshman bipartisan congressional delegation" visiting Iraq, arranged by Defense Secretary [[Robert Gates]] and led by Rep.

====Israel and the Palestine territories====
Soon after returning home from his trip to Iraq, Ellison joined with 19 other representatives on a week-long trip to Israel sponsored by the [[American Israel Education Foundation]]. House Majority Leader [[Steny Hoyer]] led the group and personally invited Ellison to join them for a stay from August 12<U+2013>18, 2007.<ref name="2nd Israel">{{cite news|title=Ellison to take weeklong trip to Israel|author=Kevin Diaz and Jake Sherman|newspaper=Star Tribune|date=August 1, 2007|url=http://www.startribune.com/587/story/1338153.html}}</ref> The group met with Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] and Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]]. Ellison's spokesperson told reporters that the trip was "a natural extension of his visit to Iraq" and that "the Middle East peace issue is important to the diverse communities of his Minneapolis-area district <U+2014> from the [[JCRC|Jewish Community Relations Council]] to the patrons of the Holy Land Middle Eastern eatery on [[Lake Street (Minneapolis)|Lake Street]] and Central Avenue. He hears about it every time he goes back to his district." The group traveled to [[Jerusalem]], [[Tel Aviv]], the northern [[Galilee]] region, and [[Ramallah]], and viewed the [[Israel-Lebanon border|Israeli border with Lebanon]].<ref name="2nd Israel"/>

During this trip, Ellison stated that Israel did not permit him to travel to [[Gaza]], where a conflict was occurring.<ref name=Rattansi>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWb2rnOJBOA US congressman Keith Ellison on Gaza]. [[Al Jazeera English]]. Published January 6, 2009.</ref>  In a 2009 interview with reporter [[Shihab Rattansi]], Ellison expressed his disappointment at his inability to see [[2008<U+2013>2009 Israel<U+2013>Gaza conflict#Humanitarian crisis|the humanitarian situation]] for himself. In the same interview, he called for a more open discussion on Gaza, stating: "The people who have a strong sympathy for the Israeli position... dominate the conversation. And it<U+2019>s really not politically safe to say, look, there are two sides to this, and Israel has not been a angel in this, and certainly there have been people on the Palestinian side who have not contributed to a constructive solution."<ref name=Rattansi/>

====Gaza and Sderot====
On February 19, 2009, Ellison and fellow Representative [[Brian Baird]] visited [[Gaza]] to view firsthand the destruction from the [[Gaza War]] and to meet with international and local relief agencies, including the [[UNRWA|United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East]]. This visit, which Ellison and Baird say did not have the official sanction of the [[Obama Administration]], was the first time any U.S. government official had entered [[Gaza]] in more than three years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090223104735/http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/wa03_baird/morenews1/GazaTrip.shtml |title=Brian Views Destruction in Gaza <U+2013> Calls for Immediate Relief and Change in Policy |publisher=House.gov |date=2009-02-19 |accessdate=2010-11-03}}</ref> Ellison had this to say about what he saw:

===Norway===
Ellison visited Norway in January 2008 in part because of Norway's prominent role in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and because of the Norwegian-American heritage of his constituents. While there, Ellison met with former Norwegian Prime Minister [[Kjell Magne Bondevik]] who is then President of the [[Oslo Center for Peace and Human Rights]]. The ''Star Tribune'' reported that the "trip underscores Ellison's desire to play a role in the international peace movement."<ref name=norway>{{cite web|last=Schonheyder|first=Caroline|title=Lessons From Peace Diplomacy Inspire Representative Keith Ellison On Visit To Norway|url=http://www.norway.org/ARCHIVE/policy/news/keithellisoninnorway/|publisher=Embassy of Norway}}</ref><ref name=StribNorway>{{cite web|last=Diaz|first=Kevin|title=Ellison going to Norway to study peace and justice|url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/12840961.html?refer=y|publisher=Star Tribune}}</ref>

===Africa===
In mid-2008, Ellison joined a U.S. [http://hdac.house.gov/ House Democracy Assistance Commission] delegation that traveled to six African countries, including [[Liberia]], [[Congo]], [[Malawi]], [[Mauritania]] and [[Kenya]]. "The people of the 5th Congressional District [his own] know that, in this globalized world, to have peace and security relies on other people having a modicum of peace and security," Ellison said upon returning. He attended a July 4 reception at the [[U.S. Ambassador to Kenya|U.S. ambassador]]'s residence in Nairobi, Kenya, where Ellison met [[Sarah Onyango Obama|Sarah Hussein Onyango Obama]], the grandmother of then-presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]].<ref name=StribAfrica>{{cite web|last=Diaz|first=Kevin|title=Ellison upbeat after visit to Africa|url=http://liveweb.archive.org/http://www.startribune.com/templates/Print_This_Story?sid=24284064|publisher=Star Tribune|accessdate=26 July 2012}}</ref>

===North American Imams Federation===
On November 18, 2006, Ellison gave a speech called "Imams and Politics" to the Fourth Annual Body Meeting of the [[North American Imams Federation]].<ref name="NAIF 2006">{{cite web| url=http://www.imamsofamerica.com/NAIF2006.pdf |title=North American Imams' Federation conference booklet| publisher= North American Imams Federation|format=PDF}}</ref> The Federation's materials presented the issues to be outlined in Ellison's speech as follows: "Many Muslims around the United States are involved in political activities at different levels. Recognizing the sensitivity of political issues and the potential for divisiveness within the communities as a result of divergent political views, [[Imam]]s must be able to provide Muslims with the proper guidance and educate them on the etiquettes of any political involvement within the Islamic context. Questions also arise on whether Imams and Islamic centers should be involved in politics at all and what the extent of this involvement should be, therefore Imams should have the ability to address these concerns. Overall, it is important that Imams are aware and understand the general political climate of their communities and be especially conversant with the issues that affect Muslims."<ref name="NAIF 2006"/> Ellison also took part in "Community Night" with Imam [[Siraj Wahhaj]], and Imam Dr. [[Omar Shahin]]. This was "for Imams to meet and interact with community members."<ref name="NAIF 2006"/> Some of the participants of this meeting became involved in the [[Flying Imams controversy]] after being removed from an Arizona bound plane for "concerning behavior".<ref>{{cite news| title=6 Muslim Imams Removed From Plane| publisher=Star and Tribune|date=November . 21, 2006 | url= http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/11/21/national/main2202120.shtml |accessdate=December 11, 2006 }}</ref> Ellison became involved in this controversy shortly after it erupted when he attempted to arrange a meeting between parties including [[US Airways]] executives, the [[Metropolitan Airports Commission]], and other legislators and community members.<ref>{{cite news| title=Ellison seeks meeting on removal of clerics| author=Rochelle Olson| newspaper= Star Tribune|date=November 24, 2006 |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MN&p_theme=mn&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&s_dispstring=(%22Ellison%20seeks%20meeting%20on%20removal%20of%20clerics%22)&p_field_advanced-0=&p_text_advanced-0=(%22Ellison%20seeks%20meeting%20on%20removal%20of%20clerics%22)&xcal_numdocs=20&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&xcal_useweights=no}}</ref>

===MOSES interfaith group===
On December 27, Ellison spoke at a meeting in Holy Redeemer Catholic Church in [[Detroit]] for Metropolitan Organizing Strategy Enabling Strength (MOSES). The meeting was with leaders from the [[Catholic]], Muslim, and [[Arab-American]] communities, along with members of the organized labor movement. He told those in attendance that the principles of Islam guide his life, but he has no intention of imposing his faith on others, "I'm not a religious leader, I've never led religious services of any kind. I'm not here to be a preacher, but in terms of political agenda items, my faith informs me."<ref name=Warikoo>{{cite news|date=Wed, December 27, 2006|title=Ellison says faith won't be exploited| author=Niraj Warikoo| publisher=Detroit Free Press|url=http://www.sanluisobispo.com/mld/sanluisobispo/news/nation/16330890.htm |accessdate=December 28, 2006 }}</ref> He addressed the Qur'an Oath controversy of the 110th United States Congress and said that he hoped religion could be a uniting, rather than a dividing force: "They've never actually tried to explore how religion should connect us, they're into how religion divides us. ...

He also "did a [[Voice of America]] interview from his office, where an American flag was placed conspicuously behind his desk for the cameras."<ref name="Rice"/> In the interview which was set to play in the Middle East and South Asia, Ellison stressed global inclusiveness and quoted verse 49:13 of the Qur'an "Oh humanity, we created you from a single pair<U+2026>"<ref name="Rice"/> Ellison also accepted the Bush administrations request to be part of a "teleconference with [[Karen Hughes]], the State Department's undersecretary for public diplomacy.

It was noted that after he took his oath of office he was surrounded by the foreign press, intrigued in part by the oath controversy, who "had to be ushered out of his office after he took his oath to make room for home-state news crews."<ref name="Rice"/> Ellison has been "featured in a series of articles written for foreign dissemination by the Department's Bureau of International Information Programs."<ref name="Rice"/> Including an article that was translated into Persian and Arabic that "highlighted the diversity of his constituents in Minnesota, ranging from Swedes and Norwegians to 'the largest Somali immigrant community in America.'"<ref name="Rice"/> In his work in cooperation with the state department, Ellison stresses the religious freedom available in the US, saying things like "religious tolerance has a much longer pedigree in America than some of the intolerance we've seen lately."<ref name="Rice"/> Even in his work with the State Department he remained critical of President Bush's Iraq policy saying "he wants people around the world to know that 'there are many Americans who want to relate to the rest of the world in terms of cooperation, not military domination.'"<ref name="Rice"/> Ellison staffers told reporters that "the State Department has shown no signs of squeamishness about publicizing his criticism of the war."<ref name="Rice"/> When asked about working with elements of the Bush administration Ellison said "Hey, my country first. We can work out our political differences later. I've said I'm willing to do whatever I can to make some friends for America."<ref name="Rice"/>

On January 2, 2007, Beck said on his [[Glenn Beck Program|radio program]] that Ellison did not take offense at the comments and the two had a friendly chat off the air. On January 9, 2007, at the Television Critics Association's semiannual press tour, Beck said it was "Quite possibly the poorest-worded question of all time."  He clarified by saying, "My point to Keith Ellison... is the same point that I make to my own faith, and that is <U+2014> you must stand up before things get out of control ... And it's important for people of all faiths, when someone is hijacking their religion, to stand and say, 'That is not what we do. That is not who we are."' <ref>{{cite news| title=Beck is in a Catch-22| author=Scott D.

===Louis Farrakhan and history with the Nation of Islam===
As a law student in 1989 and 1990, Ellison wrote several columns under the name "Keith E. Hakim" in the student newspaper, the ''[[Minnesota Daily]]''. Washington Post Staff Writer Alan Cooperman characterized Ellison's articles saying that he "defended Farrakhan against accusations of [[anti-semitism]]," and that Ellison "called affirmative action a 'sneaky' form of compensation for slavery, suggesting instead that white Americans pay [[Reparations for slavery|reparations]] to blacks." <ref name="defensePost">{{cite news|first = Alan|last = Cooperman|url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/10/AR2006091000951.html|title = Muslim Candidate Plays Defense|work = Washington Post|publisher = The Washington Post Company|page = A03|date= 2006-09-11|accessdate = 2006-09-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mndaily.com/archive/download.php?archives/1989/11271989.tif |title=Minnesota Daily archive |publisher=Mndaily.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mndaily.com/archive/download.php?archives/1990/02021990.tif |title=Minnesota Daily archive |publisher=Mndaily.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-03}}</ref>

===Campaign contributions from members of CAIR===

===Campaign finance violations===
In early 2006, the [http://www.cfboard.state.mn.us/ Minnesota State Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board] reprimanded Ellison for unreported campaign contributions, discrepancies in cash balances, and misclassified disbursements during his campaigns for the Minnesota House of Representatives. These transgressions occurred in the years 2002<U+2013>2004. In 2005, the board opened an investigation, and Ellison was subpoenaed and fined.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfboard.state.mn.us/bdinfo/investigation/Ellison_Keith_022406.pdf |title=Findings and Order in the Matter of the Committee to Ellect Keith Ellison |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfboard.state.mn.us/bdinfo/Con_Agr/Ellison_Keith_022406.pdf |title=Campaign Finance and Disclosure Board Conciliation Agreement |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-03}}</ref>

===Reichstag fire and 9/11===
On July 8, 2007, Ellison discussed the power of the executive branch in the US currently in a speech before the organization ''Atheists for Human Rights''. He stated that [[Dick Cheney]] asserts it is "beneath his dignity in order for him to answer any questions from the citizens of the United States. That is the very definition of [[totalitarianism]], [[authoritarianism]] and [[dictatorship]]."<ref name="Reish">[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/07/14/wbush114.xml  Bush like Hitler, says first Muslim in Congress],</ref> He went on to say, "It's almost like the [[Reichstag fire]], kind of reminds me of that. After the Reichstag was burned, they blamed the [[Communists]] for it and it put the leader of that country [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] in a position where he could basically have authority to do whatever he wanted. The fact is that I'm not saying [[September 11 attacks|September 11]] was a U.S. plan, or anything like that because, you know, that's how they put you in the nut-ball box <U+2014> dismiss you."<ref name="Reish"/>

[[Fox News]] picked up the story<ref>{{cite news|title=Wait Until You Hear Who<U+2019>s Comparing the Bush Administration to Nazi Germany|date=July 12, 2007|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,289157,00.html|author=Brit Hume | work=Fox News}}</ref> and their commentator [[John Gibson (media host)|John Gibson]] categorized Ellison's comments as accusing "[[George W.

Furthermore, it demonstrates a profound lack of understanding about the horrors that Hitler and his Nazi regime perpetrated."<ref name="remarks draw"/>

When later questioned about his comments, Ellison told a reporter that Osama bin Laden, and not the Bush administration, was responsible for the attacks.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Kersten| first = Katherine| title = Ellison's use of Reichstag fire goes overboard| work = Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN)| date = 2007-07-12}}</ref> Ellison also said, "In the aftermath of a tragedy, space is opened up for governments to take action that they could not have achieved before that." He pointed to the [[Iraq War]] and provisions granting greater arrest and surveillance powers within the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] as examples.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ellison cites Reichstag burning in attacking Bush policies|date=2007-07-13|url=http://www2.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/103009.html}}</ref> Ellison said also "In response to a question, I stated that the Bush Administration exploited post-9/11 fears to advance a policy agenda that has undermined our civil liberties. I stand by this statement. ...I want to be clear that the murderous Nazi regime is historically distinct and the horror of the [[Holocaust]] must be acknowledged as a unique event in human history. I did not intend any direct comparison between the totalitarian state of Nazi Germany and the current administration. I have taken consistent and strong stands against [[Holocaust denial]] throughout my life in public service."<ref name="remarks draw"/>

===Sali remarks===
Representative [[Bill Sali]], drew criticism for his comments in an August 8, 2007 interview with the conservative [[Christian]]-based ''American Family News Network''. Sali, an outspoken [[Evangelical Christian]], denounced the [[US Senate|Senate]] leadership for allowing a [[Hindu]] to lead the opening prayer. He held that invoking a non-Christian god in the Senate threatened to endanger America by removing "the protective hand of God."<ref name="onenewsnow">{{cite news|title=Idaho congressman disturbed by Hindu prayer in Senate, election of Muslim to House|url=http://www.onenewsnow.com/2007/08/idaho_congressman_disturbed_by.php|author=Jim Brown|publisher=OneNewsNow.com|date=August 8, 2007}}</ref> He then went on to say "We have not only a Hindu prayer being offered in the Senate, we have a Muslim member of the House of Representatives now, Keith Ellison from Minnesota. Those are changes and they are not what was envisioned by the Founding Fathers. The principles that this country was built on, that have made it great over these centuries, were Christian principles derived from Scripture. You know the Lord can make the rain fall on the just and the unjust alike." 

Former Idaho Democratic congressman [[Richard H. Stallings|Richard Stallings]], among others, demanded that Sali either apologize or resign. In response Sali sent Ellison an e-mail saying he "meant no offense."<ref name="Sali">{{cite news|title=Lawmaker Apologizes for Muslim Remarks|date=August 18, 2007|author=Todd Dvorak|agency=Associated Press|url=http://www.wtop.com/?nid=104&sid=1224387|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927210606/http://www.wtop.com/?nid=104&sid=1224387|archivedate=2007-09-27}}</ref> At the time Ellison was in [[Iraq]] with a congressional delegation, his spokesperson said "The congressman just doesn't respond to comments like that."<ref name="Hanh">{{cite news|title=Sali clarifies his stance on Muslim congressman|author=Gregory Hahn|publisher=Idaho Statesman|date=08/10/07|url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/newsupdates/story/129935.html}}</ref> Sali stressed to reporters that he was not calling for Ellison to be removed, "He got elected the same way I did. People certainly have the right to elect anyone they want."<ref name="Hanh"/> Sali defended his claim about America's founding principles, saying, "The idea that somehow we can move to [[multiculturalism]] and still remain the same <U+2014> I think that's a little dangerous, too. From my standpoint, I believe the Founding Fathers were overwhelmingly Christian and the God they were talking about is the God of the Bible."<ref name="Hanh"/> When asked about his policy discussions with those of other faiths he stated, "I would say, 'These are principles that I think are important,' and if he agrees with those, great. At the end of the game, maybe it does get down to religious beliefs and how they impact how you make public policy."<ref name="Hanh"/> It has been noted in a ''[[New York Sun]]'' editorial that claims dogging Ellison that the founders of the US did not anticipate Muslim legislators are incorrect.<ref name="NY Sun ed">{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/article/44639|title=Binding Ellison|publisher=New York Sun Editorial|date=December 6, 2006}}</ref> The specific subject was brought up in many of the [[Timeline of the United States Constitution|State conventions to ratify the Constitution]], including remarks by William Lancaster in the [[North Carolina]] Ratifying Convention in 1788.<ref name="NY Sun ed"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Debate in North Carolina Ratifying Convention; 30 July 1788|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendI_religions52.html}}</ref>
