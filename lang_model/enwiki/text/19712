The '''Comparative Toxicogenomics Database''' ('''CTD''') is a public website and research tool that curates scientific data describing relationships between chemicals, genes, and human diseases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mattingly CJ, Rosenstein MC, Colby GT, Forrest JN, Boyer JL |title=The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD): A Resource for Comparative Toxicological Studies |journal=J Exp Zoolog.

The database is maintained by the Department of Bioinformatics at the [[Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory]] in [[Salisbury Cove]], [[Maine]] and by the Department of Biology at [[North Carolina State University]].

CTD was launched on the web on [[November 12, 2004]].

==Goals and objectives==
One of the primary goals of CTD is to advance the understanding of the effects of environmental chemicals on human health.

The [[etiology]] of many chronic diseases involves interactions between environmental factors and genes that modulate important physiological processes. Chemicals are an important component of the environment. Conditions such as [[asthma]], [[cancer]], [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[hypertension]], [[immunodeficiency]], and [[Parkinson's disease]] are known to be influenced by the environment; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these correlations are not well understood. CTD may help resolve these mechanisms.

==Core data==
CTD is a unique resource where [[biocurator]]s<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bourne PE, McEntyre J |title=Biocurators: Contributors to the World of Science |journal=PLoS Comput Biol. |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=e142 |year=2006 |month=Oct |pmid=17411327 |pmc=1626157 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020142 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Salimi N, Vita R |title=The Biocurator: Connecting and Enhancing Scientific Data |journal=PLoS Comput Biol. |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=e125 |year=2006 |month=Oct |pmid=17069454 |pmc=1626147 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020125 }}</ref> read the scientific literature and manually curate three types of core data:

* Chemical-gene interactions
* Chemical-disease associations
* Gene-disease associations

==Data integration==
By integrating the above three data sets, CTD automatically constructs putative chemical-gene-disease networks to illuminate molecular mechanisms underlying environmentally-influenced diseases.

Users can search CTD to explore scientific data for chemicals, genes, diseases, or interactions between any of these three concepts.
Currently, CTD integrates toxicogenomic data for vertebrates and invertebrates, including 59,000 chemicals, 1.2 million gene and protein sequences (and their associated [[Gene Ontology]], [[KEGG]], and [[Reactome]] annotations), 83,000 taxonomic terms, and 6,000 human diseases to produce a unique resource for the cross-species analysis of chemical, gene, and disease interactions.
