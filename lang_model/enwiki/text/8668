The '''2005 Sugar Bowl''' was a postseason [[American football|American]] [[college football]] [[bowl game]] between the [[2004 Virginia Tech Hokies football team|Virginia Tech Hokies]] and the [[2004 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn Tigers]] at the [[Louisiana Superdome]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], on January 3, 2005. It was the 71st edition of the annual [[Sugar Bowl]] football contest. Virginia Tech represented the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC) in the contest, while Auburn represented the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC). In a defensive struggle, Auburn earned a 16&ndash;13 victory despite a late-game rally by Virginia Tech.

Virginia Tech was selected as a participant in the game after winning the [[List of Atlantic Coast Conference football champions|ACC football championship]] during the team's first year in the conference. Tech, which finished 10&ndash;2 in the regular season prior to the Sugar Bowl, defeated 16th-ranked Virginia and ninth-ranked Miami en route to the game. Auburn finished the regular season undefeated and 12&ndash;0. The Tigers defeated fourth-ranked [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] and fifth-ranked [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia]] during the course of the season, and were one of three teams to finish the regular season undefeated. The other two undefeated teams, [[USC Trojans football|Southern California]] and [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]], were selected to play in the [[BCS National Championship Game|Bowl Championship Series national championship game]]. Auburn, by virtue of its lower ranking in the [[Bowl Championship Series#Rankings|BCS poll]], was left out of the national championship and was selected to play in the Sugar Bowl.

Pre-game media coverage of the game focused on Auburn being left out of the national championship game, a point of controversy for Auburn fans and other observers in the weeks leading up to the game. Much was made of that fact and the success of Auburn [[running back]]s [[Carnell Williams]] and [[Ronnie Brown]], each of whom were considered among the best at their position. On the Virginia Tech side, senior [[quarterback]] [[Bryan Randall]] had a record-breaking season and was predicted to continue his success in the Sugar Bowl. Both teams also had high-ranked defenses, and Tech's appearance in the [[2000 Sugar Bowl]] also was mentioned in the runup to the game. 

The 2005 Sugar Bowl [[Kickoff (American football)|kicked off]] on January 3, 2005 at 8:00 p.m. [[Eastern Standard Time|EST]]. Early in the first quarter, the Tigers took an 3&ndash;0 lead. Following an [[interception]] by the Auburn defense, the Tigers were able to extend their lead to 6&ndash;0. In the second quarter, another [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] resulted in three points for the Tigers. At [[halftime]], Auburn led, 9&ndash;0. Auburn opened the second half with its first and only [[touchdown]] drive of the game, giving Auburn a 16&ndash;0 lead, which it held into the fourth quarter. In that quarter, Tech scored its first touchdown of the game but did not convert the [[two-point conversion|two-point try]], making the score 16&ndash;6. Late in the quarter, Tech quarterback Bryan Randall cut Auburn's lead to 16&ndash;13 on an 80-yard [[forward pass|pass]] that resulted in another touchdown. With almost no time remaining in the game, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an [[onside kick]] to have another chance on offense. When Auburn recovered the kick, the Tigers were able to [[running out the clock|run out the clock]] and secure the win. In recognition of his game-winning performance, Auburn quarterback Jason Campbell was named the game's [[most valuable player]].

Despite Auburn's victory and the Tigers' undefeated season, they were not named national champions. That honor went to the University of Southern California, which defeated Oklahoma in the [[2005 Orange Bowl|2005 national championship game]]. Three voters in the final [[Associated Press]] poll of the season voted Auburn the number one team in the country, but their votes were not enough to deny USC a national championship, as voted by members of the Associated Press and Coaches' polls. Several players from each team were selected in the [[2005 NFL Draft]] and went on to careers in the [[National Football League]].

== Team selection ==

Virginia Tech and Auburn each earned automatic spots in a BCS bowl game due to their status as conference champions, and were selected by the 2005 Sugar Bowl. Virginia Tech finished the season 10&ndash;2 and was named ACC football champion its first year in the conference.<ref name="VT selection">[http://www.hokiesports.com/football/recaps/1252004aaa.html Tech Meets Auburn in 71st Nokia Sugar Bowl Classic] Virginia Tech Athletics Department, Hokiesports.com.

Following the loss, Virginia Tech was 2&ndash;2 on the season, and faced the potential of being [[Bowl eligible|ineligible for a postseason bowl game]] if it did not improve its winning percentage.

=== Auburn ===

Auburn, like Virginia Tech, had gone 8&ndash;5 during the [[2003 NCAA Division I-A football season|2003 college football season]],<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/teams/schedule?teamId=2&year=2003 Auburn Tigers Schedule - 2003] ESPN.com, Accessed May 26, 2008.</ref> and entered the 2004 season with high expectations.

== Pre-game buildup ==

In the weeks leading up to the game, media coverage of the game focused on Auburn's exclusion from the national championship game, a controversial point for Auburn fans and other observers in the weeks leading up to the game. In addition, both teams boasted high-ranked defenses that had performed well during the year. Much was made of that fact and the success of Auburn running backs Carnell Williams and Ronnie Brown, each of whom were considered among the best players at their position. On the Virginia Tech side, senior quarterback Bryan Randall performed well for the Hokies during the regular season and was predicted to continue his success in the Sugar Bowl.

=== Rankings controversy ===

Shortly after the final pre-[[bowl game]] Bowl Championship Series standings were released on December 4, Auburn was among several teams disgruntled with the system. One of these was [[California Golden Bears football|California]], which only lost to top-ranked USC, but was denied a bid to the prestigious [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] after [[2004 Texas Longhorns football team|Texas]] vaulted it in the rankings despite having the same record. The Golden Bears were forced to attend the less-attractive [[Holiday Bowl]] instead.<ref>[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=281550 Computers, humans agree: USC, Oklahoma are No. 1 and No. 2 teams] Jeff Potrykus, ''Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel'', December 5, 2004.

Sportswriters also pointed to the Tigers' tougher conference schedule when compared to those of USC and Oklahoma. SEC commissioner Mike Slive remarked, "If Auburn goes through this league undefeated, they deserve to play for the national championship."<ref name="Weiss">[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2004/12/05/2004-12-05_sugar_is_bittersweet_for_unb.html Sugar is Bittersweet for Unbeaten Auburn] Dick Weiss, ''New York Daily News'', December 5, 2004.

Due to the controversy surrounding Auburn's failure to be given a chance to play for the national championship and controversies involving teams lobbying for improved ratings in the poll, the Associated Press sent a cease-and-desist order to BCS officials, forbidding them the use of the AP Poll in calculating BCS ratings.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A17429-2004Dec21.html?sub=AR AP Opts Out Of Formula For BCS] Mark Schlabach, ''The Washington Post'', December 22, 2004.

Auburn head coach [[Tommy Tuberville]] was named the Associated Press Coach of the Year on December 24, due in large part to his success in using Auburn's new West Coast offense to drive the Tigers to an undefeated 12&ndash;0 regular season.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A24809-2004Dec24.html Tuberville Is Named Coach of Year] The Washington Post, December 25, 2004.

Heading Auburn's offense on the field was quarterback Jason Campbell. Campbell finished the regular season with 2,511&nbsp;yards and 19&nbsp;touchdowns, one short of tying the Auburn record for most touchdowns in a single season. Campbell was second in the Southeastern Conference in [[forward pass|passing yards]] per game (209.2), and was a first-team All-SEC selection.<ref name="Indy SEC honors">[http://auburntigers.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/120804aad.html Campbell, Williams, Tuberville Earn SEC Individual Honors] Auburn Tigers Athletic Department.

Auburn's [[Rush (American football)|rushing offense]] was led by two highly regarded running backs: [[Carnell Williams]] and [[Ronnie Brown]]. The two men, combined with quarterback Campbell, ran for 15,739&nbsp;yards and 129&nbsp;career touchdowns prior to the Sugar Bowl.<ref name="AU RBs"/> Williams led the SEC in all-purpose yardage (137.2&nbsp;yards per game) and average yards per [[punt return]] (11.7).

The touchdown mark was the most recorded by a running back in the SEC that year.<ref name="Indy SEC honors"/> For his accomplishments, Williams was named a first-team All-SEC pick.

Despite the attention focused on Auburn's two star running backs, the team also boasted a capable corps of [[wide receiver]]s as well. Prior to the game, Auburn receiver Ben Obomanu said, "When you have your running game making big plays and the defense has to load the box ([[defensive line]]) to make plays and try to stop the running game, that opens up things in the passing game." Auburn averaged more yards passing (241.4&nbsp;per game) than running (189.4&nbsp;per game).<ref name="AU offense"/>

=== Virginia Tech offense ===

Heading into the Sugar Bowl, the Virginia Tech offense was led by quarterback [[Bryan Randall]], who completed 149 of 268&nbsp;passes (55.6&nbsp;percent) for 1,965&nbsp;yards, 19&nbsp;touchdowns, and seven&nbsp;interceptions. He also rushed for 466&nbsp;yards and held Tech career records for total offense and passing yards. His 37&nbsp;consecutive [[starting lineup|starts]] also are a school mark for a quarterback.<ref name="Randall">[http://www.roanoke.com/sports/college/wb/xp-15537 Double redemption] Mark Berman, ''The Roanoke Times''.

Tech's rushing offense featured two running backs who shared time on the field: [[Mike Imoh]] and [[Cedric Humes]]. During the regular season, Imoh rushed the ball 152&nbsp;times for 704&nbsp;yards, an average of 4.6&nbsp;yards per carry.

=== First quarter ===

Following the ceremonial pre-game coin toss, Auburn elected to kick off to Virginia Tech to begin the game, ensuring the Tigers would have possession to begin the second half. Tech began the first drive of the game from its 20-yard line following a [[touchback]]. The Hokies initially had success moving the ball, as quarterback Bryan Randall rushed for seven yards on the game's first play, then completed a four-yard pass to wide receiver Eddie Royal two plays later for a first down. The Auburn defense recovered, however, and the Hokies did not gain another first down and were forced to [[Punt (football)|punt]]. Auburn recovered the ball and began its first drive of the game from its 26-yard line. On the Tigers' first play, quarterback Jason Campbell threw a long pass to Cooper Wallace for 35&nbsp;yards. This was followed by another long play as running back Ronnie Brown ran for 31&nbsp;yards. After the initial shock of the Auburn offense, the Virginia Tech defense firmed up, and Auburn's next three plays were stopped for losses or minimal gains. Facing a fourth down at the Virginia Tech six-yard line, Auburn sent in kicker John Vaughn, who kicked a 23-yard [[field goal]] for the game's first points. With 8:35 remaining in the first quarter, Auburn took an early 3&ndash;0 lead.<ref name="1st"/>

Following the post-field goal kickoff, the Virginia Tech offense attempted to answer Auburn's quick score. Unfortunately for the Hokies, their second drive fared even worse than the first. Tech committed a 10-yard penalty, suffered an eight-yard loss on a play, then had a Bryan Randall pass [[interception|intercepted]] by Auburn [[Safety (American football)|safety]] Junior Rosegreen. Rosegreen returned the ball 31 yards, and put Auburn's offense into good field position for its second drive of the game. Auburn also suffered an early penalty in its drive, but moved the ball with another long play<U+2014>a 23-yard pass to Courtney Taylor<U+2014>to recover. Again, however, the Virginia Tech defense recovered to force Auburn into a fourth down and a field goal attempt. Vaughn returned to the field and kicked a 19-yard field goal, giving Auburn a 6&ndash;0 lead with 1:06 remaining in the quarter.<ref name="1st"/>

With time in the quarter running out, Virginia Tech fielded the post-score kickoff and executed a quick series of plays, gaining a first down before time ran out. At the end of the first quarter, Auburn held an early 6&ndash;0 lead.<ref name="1st">[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=250030259&period=1 1st Qtr Play-by-Play] ESPN.com, January 3, 2005. Accessed May 22, 2008.</ref>

=== Second quarter ===

Virginia Tech began the second quarter in possession of the ball and driving down the field. Bryan Randall completed a 10-yard pass for another first down, but after Tech failed to gain another, the Hokies were forced to punt. Auburn reciprocated by going [[three and out]] and punting the ball back to Virginia Tech. In its first full drive of the second quarter, the Hokies had their best drive of the first half. After a holding penalty nullified a long [[kickoff return]], Tech began at its 24-yard line. Randall completed a nine-yard pass to tight end Jeff King, then ran for another nine yards on a quarterback scramble. He followed the first-down run by completing three consecutive long passes of 16&nbsp;yards, 13&nbsp;yards, and 31&nbsp;yards, respectively. The last pass, to wide receiver Josh Hyman, drove Virginia Tech inside the Auburn two-yard line. There, however, the Tech offense faltered. On three plays, Tech failed to cross the [[Goal line (American football)|goal line]], gaining only one yard in the process. Facing fourth down and needing just one yard for a touchdown, Virginia Tech head coach [[Frank Beamer]] elected to attempt to gain the touchdown, rather than send in his kicker for a field goal attempt. The attempted touchdown pass by Randall fell [[incomplete pass|incomplete]], and Virginia Tech [[Glossary of American football#T|turned the ball over on downs]] without scoring any points.<ref name="2nd"/>

Auburn's offense took over at its one-yard line after Tech's failure to score. Jason Campbell orchestrated a successful drive that took Auburn from the shadow of its own [[end zone]], completing passes of 16&nbsp;yards, 15&nbsp;yards, and 37&nbsp;yards in the process. Inside the Virginia Tech [[red zone]], however, the Auburn offense again stumbled. As it had in its two previous scoring drives, Auburn was forced to send in kicker John Vaughn despite being inside the Virginia Tech 10-yard line. Vaughn's 24-yard kick was successful, and with 1:50 remaining in the second quarter, Auburn extended its lead to 9&ndash;0.<ref name="2nd"/>

With little time remaining before [[halftime]], Virginia Tech used a [[hurry-up offense]]. Randall completed a 23-yard pass to Eddie Royal and ran for 22&nbsp;yards on his own, but threw three consecutive incomplete passes to end the drive. Tech was forced to punt the ball away, and the first half came to an end. At halftime, Auburn led, 9&ndash;0.<ref name="2nd">[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=250030259&period=2 2nd Qtr Play-by-Play] ESPN.com, January 3, 2005. Accessed May 22, 2008.</ref>

=== Halftime ===

The halftime show was presented by Bowl Games of America, a collection of [[Contemporary dance|dance troupe]]s, [[marching band]]s, and [[cheerleader|cheerleading squads]] from across the United States. Together, the organizations presented a pirate-themed show based on the character of [[Jean Lafitte]], a noted [[brigand]] who lived in New Orleans<U+2014>site of the game<U+2014>during the [[War of 1812]].<ref name="Game Program p. 44"/>

=== Third quarter ===

Because Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the game, Auburn received the ball to begin the second half. The Tigers started the first drive of the second half at their 22-yard line. Carnell Williams and Ronnie Brown alternated carries as Auburn gained 17 yards in their first three plays. Jason Campbell completed a pass for a five-yard loss, then, on the fifth play of the drive, completed a 53-yard pass to Anthony Mix. The pass was the longest play of the game, and drove the Tigers inside the Virginia Tech [[red zone]]. Three plays later, Campbell connected with [[Devin Aromashodu]] on a five-yard pass for the game's first touchdown. With 10:39 remaining in the third quarter, Auburn had taken a 16&ndash;0 lead.<ref name="3rd"/>

After Auburn's kickoff, Virginia Tech started its first drive of the second half at its 20-yard line. Down by 16 points, Tech needed to score. The Hokies gained a quick first down, but a five-yard penalty and a sack of Bryan Randall prevented Tech from gaining another. The Hokies were forced to punt, and Auburn took over at its 44-yard line. Despite having good field position, the Tigers went three and out. Following the punt, Virginia Tech reciprocated by also going three and out. With 3:47 remaining in the quarter, Auburn began an offensive drive from its 35-yard line. From the beginning of the drive, however, the Tigers had problems. The first play of Auburn's drive was a 10-yard penalty against the Tigers. The second resulted in a one-yard loss by Ronnie Brown, who attempted to rush through the middle of the [[defensive line]]. On the third play, Virginia Tech cornerback Jimmy Williams intercepted an errant pass by Jason Campbell. Though Williams was unable to advance the ball, the Hokies still took over on offense, and with 2:38 remaining in the quarter, had their best field position since the first half.<ref name="3rd"/>

The first play of the Tech drive resulted in a 12-yard gain as Josh Hyman rushed for 12 yards and a first down on an [[end-around]]. Running back Cedric Humes was stopped for a loss on the first play after Hyman's rush, but earned 10&nbsp;yards on two subsequent rushes, setting up a fourth down. Needing one yard for a first down, behind by 16&nbsp;points, and with time running down in the quarter, Tech head coach Frank Beamer elected to attempt the first down play rather than kick a field goal. Humes again rushed the ball, and as time ran out in the third quarter, picked up enough ground for the first down. With one quarter of play remaining, Auburn led Virginia Tech 16&ndash;0, but the Hokies had picked up a first down inside the Auburn 10-yard line to begin the fourth quarter.<ref name="3rd">[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=250030259&period=3 3rd Qtr Play-by-Play] ESPN.com, January 3, 2005. Accessed May 23, 2008.</ref>

=== Fourth quarter ===

Virginia Tech began the fourth quarter in possession of the ball, and facing a first down at the Auburn 10-yard line. In three consecutive plays, however, the Hokies only picked up a total of four yards. Needing six yards to get a touchdown, Virginia Tech sent in kicker Brandon Pace to attempt a 23-yard field goal. Despite the short distance, Pace missed the kick. With 13:56 remaining in the game, Auburn still held a 16&ndash;0 lead.<ref name="4th"/>

Following the missed field goal, Auburn took over on offense at its six-yard line<U+2014>the point from which Tech had missed the kick. Ronnie Brown picked up 13 yards and a first down on three rushes. Carnell Williams then picked up three yards, and Jason Campbell threw a seven-yard pass that gave Auburn another first down. A five-yard penalty against Virginia Tech pushed Auburn's offense near midfield, and Ronnie Brown returned to the field, rushing the ball four consecutive times for 16&nbsp;yards and driving the Tigers into Virginia Tech territory. Facing a fourth down and one yard, Auburn elected to give the ball to Brown again. On the one-yard run, however, Brown [[fumble]]d the ball, which was recovered by Virginia Tech's Mikal Baagee with 8:38 remaining.<ref name="4th"/>

Virginia Tech's offense came on to the field desperately needing to score quickly. Though the deficit was only 16&nbsp;points, and could be made up with two touchdowns and two two-point conversions, the limited time remaining meant the task would be difficult, even if Virginia Tech scored quickly. The Hokies began the drive with a 17-yard pass by quarterback Bryan Randall. Justin Hamilton rushed for five yards, and Randall completed a six-yard pass for another first down. The Tigers helped matters by committing a 15-yard penalty, which put the Hokies inside Auburn territory. Three plays later, Randall capitalized on the opportunity by completing a 29-yard pass to Josh Morgan for a touchdown and the Hokies' first points of the game. Tech attempted a two-point conversion, but the pass attempt fell incomplete. With 6:57 remaining, Virginia Tech now trailed 16&ndash;6.<ref name="4th"/>

After receiving the post-touchdown kickoff, Auburn began to [[running out the clock|run out the clock]]. The Tigers failed to pick up a first down, and after going three and out, punted the ball back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies started their drive at their two-yard line, and Randall began it successfully by completing a 20-yard pass, rushing for 10&nbsp;yards, then completing a five-yard pass to bring the Hokies near midfield. On the fourth play of the drive, however, Randall was intercepted by Auburn's Derrick Graves. The Tigers, their offense again on the field, began running out the clock again. Tech attempted to interrupt Auburn's clock management by calling timeouts after each play, stopping the clock with each timeout. Virginia Tech forced Auburn into a three and out, and the Tigers again punted the ball away with 2:13 remaining.<ref name="4th"/>

After the ball rolled into the end zone for a [[touchback]], Virginia Tech began its final drive at its 20-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Bryan Randall completed an 80-yard touchdown pass to Josh Morgan. The score plus the [[extra point]] cut Auburn's lead to 16&ndash;13. With time in the game almost exhausted, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an [[onside kick]] in order to have a chance to get another offensive drive. Because the Hokies had used their final timeouts to stop the clock on Auburn's previous drive, Auburn would be free to run out the game's final minutes. Despite the hopes of Virginia Tech for a last-second miracle, the Auburn Tigers recovered the kick, allowing them to run out the clock and clinch a 16&ndash;13 victory.<ref name="4th">[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=250030259&period=4 4th Qtr Play-by-Play] ESPN.com, January 3, 2005.
