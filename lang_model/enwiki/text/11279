'''Ram Narayan''' ({{lang-hi|<U+0930><U+093E><U+092E> <U+0928><U+093E><U+0930><U+093E><U+092F><U+0923>}}; [[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]: {{IAST|R<U+0101>m N<U+0101>r<U+0101>ya<U+1E47>}}, {{IPA-hns|<U+02C8>ra<U+02D0>m na<U+02D0><U+02C8>ra<U+02D0>jn|IPA}}; born 25 December 1927), often referred to by the title [[Pandit]], is an [[India]]n musician who popularized the bowed instrument ''[[sarangi]]'' as a solo concert instrument in [[Hindustani classical music]] and became the first internationally successful ''sarangi'' player.

Narayan was born in [[Udaipur]] and learned to play the ''sarangi'' at an early age. He studied under ''sarangi'' players and singers and, as a teenager, worked as a music teacher and traveling musician. [[All India Radio]], [[Lahore]], hired Narayan as an accompanist for vocalists in 1944. He moved to [[Delhi]] following the [[partition of India]] in 1947, but wishing to go beyond accompaniment and frustrated with his supporting role, Narayan moved to [[Mumbai]] in 1949 to work in [[Cinema of India|Indian cinema]].

After an unsuccessful attempt in 1954, Narayan became a concert solo artist in 1956, and later gave up accompaniment. He recorded solo albums and began to tour America and Europe in the 1960s. Narayan taught Indian and foreign students and performed, frequently outside of India, into the 2000s. He was awarded India's second highest civilian honor, the [[Padma Vibhushan]], in 2005.

== Early life ==

Ram Narayan was born on 25 December 1927 in [[Udaipur]] in northwestern India.<ref name="Sorrell11">Sorrell 1980, p. 11</ref> His great-great-grandfather, Bagaji Biyavat, was a singer from [[Amber, India|Amber]], and he and Narayan's great-grandfather, Sagad Danji Biyavat, sang at the court of the [[Maharana]] of Udaipur.<ref name="Sorrell11" /> Narayan's grandfather, Har Lalji Biyavat, and father, Nathuji Biyavat, were farmers and singers, Nathuji played the bowed instrument ''[[dilruba]]'', and Narayan's mother was a music lover.<ref name="Sorrell13">Sorrell 1980, p. 13</ref> Narayan's first language was [[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]] and he learned [[Hindi]] and, later, English.<ref name="Q108">Qureshi 2007, p. 108</ref><ref name="Q109">Qureshi 2007, p. 109</ref> At an age of about six, he found a small ''sarangi'' left by the family's ''Ganga guru'', a genealogist, and was taught a [[fingering]] technique developed by his father.<ref name="Sorrell14">Sorrell 1980, p. 14</ref><ref name="Bor149">Bor 1987, p. 149</ref> Narayan's father taught him, but was worried about the difficulty of playing the ''sarangi'' and its association with courtesan music, which gave the instrument a low social status.<ref name="Sorrell13">Sorrell 1980, p. 13</ref><ref name="NewGrove">Sorrell 2001, p. 637</ref> After a year, Biyavat sought lessons for his son from ''sarangi'' player Mehboob Khan of [[Jaipur]], but changed his mind when Khan told him Narayan would have to change his fingering technique.<ref name="Bor149" /> Narayan's father later encouraged him to leave school and devote himself to playing the ''sarangi''.<ref name="Sorrell14" />

At about 10 years of age, Narayan learned the basics of ''[[dhrupad]]'', the oldest genre of [[Hindustani classical music]], by studying and imitating the practice of ''sarangi'' player Uday Lal of Udaipur, a student of ''dhrupad'' singers Allabande and Zakiruddin Dagar.<ref name="Bor149" /><ref name="Guide">Bor 1999, p. 180</ref> After Uday Lal died of old age, Narayan met traveling singer Madhav Prasad, originally of [[Lucknow]], who had performed at the court of [[Maihar]].<ref name="Bor151">Bor 1987, p. 151</ref><ref name="Sorrell15">Sorrell 1980, p. 15</ref> With Prasad, Narayan enacted the ''ganda bandhan'', a traditional ceremony of acceptance between a teacher and his pupil, in which Narayan swore obedience in exchange for being maintained by Prasad.<ref name="Sorrell17">Sorrell 1980, p. 17</ref> He served Prasad and was taught in ''[[khyal]]'', the predominate genre of Hindustani classical music, but returned to Udaipur after four years to teach music school.<ref name="Guide" /><ref name="Bor151" /> Prasad later visited Narayan and convinced him to resign his position and dedicate his time to improvement as a musician, although the idea of giving up a steady life was not well received by Narayan's family.<ref name="Bor151" /><ref name="Sorrell15" /> He stayed with Prasad and traveled to several Indian states until Prasad fell ill and advised him to learn from singer [[Abdul Wahid Khan]] in [[Lahore]].<ref name="Sorrell16">Sorrell 1980, p. 16</ref> Following Prasad's death in Lucknow, Narayan enacted the ''ganda bandhan'' with another teacher who gave him lessons, but soon left for Lahore and never performed the ritual again.<ref name="Sorrell17" />

== Career ==
Narayan traveled to Lahore in 1943 and auditioned for the local [[All India Radio]] (AIR) as a singer, but the station's music producer, Jivan Lal Mattoo, noticed grooves in Narayan's fingernails:<ref name="Sorrell16" /> ''sarangis'' are played by pressing the fingernails sideways against three playing strings, which strains the nails.<ref>Bor 1987, p. 30</ref> Mattoo instead employed Narayan as a ''sarangi'' player.<ref name="Sorrell16" /> Traditionally, the ''sarangi'' is supposed to play after the singer and imitate the vocal performance, and play in the space between phrases.<ref name="Sorrell21">Sorrell 1980, p. 21</ref> Mattoo advised Narayan and helped him contact ''khyal'' singer [[Abdul Wahid Khan]], a rigorous teacher under whom Narayan learned four ''[[raga]]s'' through singing lessons.<ref name="NewGrove" /><ref name="Bor151" /><ref name="Sorrell19">Sorrell 1980, p. 19</ref> Narayan was allowed sporadic solo performances on AIR and began to consider a solo career.<ref name="Sorrell20">Sorrell 1980, p. 20</ref>

After the [[partition of India]] in 1947, Narayan moved to [[Delhi]] and played at the local AIR station.<ref name="NewGrove" /> His work for popular singers increased his repertoire and knowledge of styles.<ref name="Neuhoff">Neuhoff 2006, pp. 911<U+2013>912</ref> Narayan played with the classical singers [[Omkarnath Thakur]], [[Bade Ghulam Ali Khan]], [[Hirabai Badodekar]], and [[Krishnarao Shankar Pandit]], and he accompanied singer [[Amir Khan (singer)|Amir Khan]] in 1948, when Khan sang for the first time at AIR Delhi following the partition.<ref name="TIE020218">{{cite news|last=Dhaneshwar|first=Amarendra|title=Saviour of the sarangi, Pandit Ram Narayan|publisher=''[[The Indian Express]]''|date=18 February 2002|url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=10069 |accessdate=9 May 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rUScyGGB|archivedate=25 July 2010}}</ref><ref>Qureshi 2007, p. 116</ref> As an accompanist for vocalists, Narayan showed his own talent and came to the foreground.<ref name="Sorrell20" /> Singers of the city complained that he was not a dependable accompanist and too assertive, but he maintained he wanted to keep vocalists in tune and inspire them in a cordial contest.<ref name="Sorrell2022">Sorrell 1980, p. 20<U+2013>22</ref> Other ''[[tabla]]'' (percussion) players  and singers, including Omkarnath Thakur and Krishnarao Shankar Pandit, expressed admiration for Narayan's playing.<ref name="Sorrell22">Sorrell 1980, p. 22</ref>

(Duration: 10:07)]]
Narayan's style is characteristic of [[Hindustani classical music]], but his choice of solo instrument and his background of learning from teachers outside his community are not common for the genre.<ref name="Q107" /><ref name="Sorrellviii">Sorrell 1980, p. viii</ref> He has stated that aims to please an audience and create a feeling of harmony, and expects the audience to reciprocate by reacting to his playing.<ref name="Sorrell29">Sorrell 1980, p. 29<U+2013>31</ref>

Narayan's performances are strung together from the meditative and measured ''[[alap]]'' (non-metrical introduction) and ''[[jor]]'' (performance with pulse) in ''[[dhrupad]]'' style, followed by a faster and less reserved ''[[Gat (music)|gat]]'' section (composition with rhythmic pattern provided by the ''[[tabla]]'') in ''[[khyal]]'' style.<ref name="Sorrell125">Sorrell 1980, p. 125</ref> He experimented with a style of ''[[jhala]]'' (performance with rapid pulse) developed by [[Bundu Khan]], but considered it more appropriate for plucked instruments and stopped performing it.<ref name="Sorrell111">Sorrell 1980, p. 111</ref> The ''gat'' section includes one or two parts with compositions.<ref name="Sorrell123">Sorrell 1980, p. 123</ref> When two ''gats'' are used, the first one tends to be at a slow or medium tempo, and the second one is faster; the ''gats'' are usually performed in the 16-beat rhythmic cycle ''[[tintal]]''.<ref name="Sorrell125" /><ref name="Sorrell126">Sorrell 1980, p. 126</ref> Narayan often completes performances with ''ragas'' associated with ''[[thumri]]'' (a popular light classical genre), which are referred to as ''mishra'' ([[Sanskrit]]: mixed) because they allow for additional notes, or with a ''[[dhun]]'' (song based on folk music).<ref name="Sorrell125" />

Narayan practices and teaches using a limited number of ''paltas'', exercises in a small scale range that are used to prepare playing different numbers of notes per bow.<ref name="Sorrell7071">Sorrell 1980, pp. 70<U+2013>71</ref> Derived from ''paltas'' are lengthy note patterns called ''tans'', which contain characteristic "melodic shapes" and are used by Narayan for fast playing.<ref name="Sorrell75">Sorrell 1980, p. 75</ref> He uses his left (fingering) hand for runs and to play an extended melodic range, and his right (bowing) hand for rhythmic accentuations.<ref name="Neuhoff" /> Narayan's fingering technique, his low right hand position, keeping the bow in a close to right angle to the string, and his use of the full bow length are unusual among ''sarangi'' players.<ref>Sorrell 1980, p. 63</ref>

Narayan is associated with the [[Kirana gharana|Kirana ''gharana'']] (stylistic school of Kirana) through [[Abdul Wahid Khan]], but his performance style is not strongly connected to it.<ref name="Sorrell27">Sorrell 1980, p. 27</ref> Most of Narayan's compositions are from the singing repertoire of his teachers and were modified and adapted to the ''sarangi''.<ref name="Sorrell123" /> He has created original compositions and in performance varies those he was taught.<ref name="Sorrell127">Sorrell 1980, pp. 127<U+2013>128</ref> Narayan disfavors the creation of new ''ragas'', but developed compound ''ragas'', including those of [[Nand (raga)|''Nand'']] with [[Kedar (raga)|''Kedar'']] and [[Kafi (raga)|''Kafi'']] with [[Malhar (raga)|''Malhar'']].<ref name="Sorrell127" />

Narayan uses a ''sarangi'' obtained from Uday Lal and built in [[Meerut]] in the 1920s or 1930s in his concerts and recordings.<ref name="Sorrell55">Sorrell 1980, p. 55</ref> He plays on foreign harp strings to produce a clearer tone.<ref>Neuman 1990, p. 228</ref> Narayan experimented with modifications to his instrument and added a fourth string, but removed it because it hindered playing.<ref name="Sorrell56">Sorrell 1980, p. 56</ref> In the 1940s, he exchanged [[Catgut|gut]] with steel for the first string and found it easier to play, but reverted to using only gut strings because the steel string altered the sound.<ref name="Sorrell56" />

Narayan increased the status of the ''sarangi'' to that of a modern concert solo instrument, made it known outside of India, and was the first ''sarangi'' player with international success, an example later followed by [[Sultan Khan (musician)|Sultan Khan]].<ref name="Neuhoff" /><ref>Slawek 2000, p. 207</ref><ref name="Mastersp78">Bor 1992, p. 78</ref> Narayan's simplified fingering technique allows for glide (''[[meend]]'')<ref>Bor 1987, pp. 34<U+2013>35</ref> and affected the modern ''sarangi'' concert style, as aspects of his playing and tone creation were taken up by ''sarangi'' players from Narayan's recordings.<ref name="Q108" />
