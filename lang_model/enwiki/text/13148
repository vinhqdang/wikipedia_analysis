'''Hurricane Linda''' was a [[tropical cyclone]] of the [[1997 Pacific hurricane season]]. It was the strongest [[hurricane]] ever observed in the eastern north [[Pacific Ocean]], with sustained winds of 185&nbsp;mph, gusts to 220&nbsp;mph, and a central pressure of 902&nbsp;mbar. Linda was part of an abnormally active season for both the Eastern and Western Pacific Basins. Fortunately, the powerful system had little impact on the mainland, although it did pass directly over [[Socorro Island]].

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Linda 1997 track.png}}
A tropical wave moved off the coast of [[Africa]] on [[August 24]]. It moved across the unfavorable [[Atlantic Ocean]] without development. As it crossed [[Central America]] convection increased, and a poorly-defined center developed early on [[September 9]]. Banding and convection increased, and it became a tropical depression that night, 460 miles (740 km) south of the [[Mexico|Mexican]] port of [[Manzanillo, Colima]].<ref name="NHC"/>

Tropical Depression 14-E continued northwestward, and became a tropical storm on [[September 10]]. Linda started to intensify more quickly, becoming a hurricane on the 11th 545 miles (880 km) south-southeast of the southern tip of [[Baja California]]. After 30 hours of rapidly intensifying, Linda reached its peak with 185 [[mph]] (295 [[km/h]]) winds on [[September 12]]. <!-- That is an increase of 95 knots, and a drop of 85 [[millibar]]s. (this sentence makes no sense) --> Linda moved directly over [[Socorro Island]] that same day as a Category 5 hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. Over the next few days, cooler waters weakened the storm greatly, and Linda dissipated on [[September 17]].<ref name="NHC"/>

==Preparations==
{{Category 5 Pacific hurricanes|align=left}}
At one point on [[September 13]], some [[tropical cyclone prediction model|computer models]] were [[weather forecasting|predicting]] that the hurricane would recurve and [[List of California tropical storms|make landfall in California]]. A [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] was located in the vicinity of the hurricane. Winds caused by that trough would have recurved the hurricane towards [[southern California]].<ref name="USA Today">{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wlinda.htm|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=2005-05-17|title=Hurricane Linda|accessdate=2006-03-22|author=Jack Williams}}</ref> Due to the possible threat, some media sources indicated that hurricane conditions would affect southern California. However, the [[National Weather Service]] in [[Oxnard, California]] issued a statement that stressed the uncertainty of the hurricane's path. The statement also indicated the main threat to be rainfall and rough seas.<ref name="nws">{{cite web|author=National Weather Service|year=1997|title=Hurricane Linda NWS Statement|accessdate=2006-07-14|url=http://www.weathermatrix.net/tropical/1997/linda/}}</ref>

The large waves caused by Hurricane Linda also resulted in flood warnings being issued for part of the Mexican coast.<ref name="CNN2">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/9709/14/linda/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|title=Hurricane Linda rumbles off S.

==Impact==
[[Image:Hurricane Linda 12 sept 1997 midday.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Hurricane Linda near peak intensity]]
Hurricane Linda never came near mainland North America. It did pass over [[Socorro Island]] on [[September 12]], where it cut power to meteorological instruments.<ref name="NHC"/> Large waves caused by the system caused minor flooding in the [[Mexican states]] of [[Michoac<U+00E1>n]], [[Nayarit]], [[Jalisco]], and [[Sinaloa]]. Those waves also caused hotels and [[resort]]s to close in [[Cabo San Lucas]], [[Mazatl<U+00E1>n]], [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]], [[San Carlos Nuevo Guaymas, Sonora|San Carlos]], and [[Puerto Vallarta]].<ref name=CNN1>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/9709/13/linda.pm/index.html|date=1997-09-13|publisher=[[CNN]]|title=Hurricane Linda weakens, may be headed for California|accessdate=2006-03-22}}</ref>

The hurricane also produced strong waves of up to 15&nbsp;feet in height along the coast of [[California]].<ref name="wrh">{{cite web|author=National Weather Service|year=2004|title=A History of Significant Local Weather Effects for San Diego|accessdate=2006-07-14|url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/sgx/research/Guide/weatherhistory.pdf}}</ref> These waves swept five people off of a [[jetty]] in [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]]. The people were rescued and survived, although one was badly injured.<ref name=NHC/> Moisture from Linda, which contributed to hourly rates of 2.5&nbsp;inches in [[Forest Falls, California|Forest Falls]], caused severe flooding and mudslides in southern California. One mudslide destroyed 2 houses and damaged 77. Damage totaled to $3.2&nbsp;million (1997 USD, $3.8 million 2005 USD).<ref name="wrh"/>

Because Linda did little or no damage due to it remaining over open waters, the name was not retired by the [[World Meteorological Organization]]. It was used again during the 2003 season. It is scheduled to be used again during the 2009 Pacific hurricane season.
