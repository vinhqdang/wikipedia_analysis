'''Psylocke''' ('''Elisabeth "Betsy" Braddock''', sometimes misspelled, even in the published comics, as '''Elizabeth''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]], sister to [[Captain Britain]], and often associated with the [[X-Men]]. 

Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Herb Trimpe]], she first appeared in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]-only [[comic book]] ''Captain Britain'' #8 (December 1976). She was originally a [[supporting character]] of her brother Captain Britain and briefly substituted for him in the role. In [[Spain]] Psylocke is called ''Mariposa Mental'', which translates to "Mental Butterfly".

Psylocke is a [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]; originally a [[telepathy|telepath]], she currently possesses [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]]. She is also a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant.

==Publication history==
Elisabeth Braddock first appeared in the ''[[Captain Britain|Captain Britain (1st series) #8]]'' (December 1976) issue. There, writer [[Chris Claremont]] introduced her as a supporting character of her brother [[Brian Braddock]], the eponymous Captain Britain, and established she was "charter pilot" without mention of superpowers. In the ''Super Spider-Man and Captain Britain #243'' issue (October 1977), writer [[Larry Lieber]] established that Braddock has become a professional [[mannequin]].

Braddock was equipped with superpowers in the ''Daredevils #3'' (March 1983) issue by [[Alan Moore]]. Moore established that she had developed [[psychic]] powers, had begun working for the fictional [[S.T.R.I.K.E.]] governmental organisation and lets her dye her hair purple: latter color would dominate her portrayals in later years. Then, Braddock was subjected to gory violence in the ''Captain Britain (2nd series)'' book, in which she was almost raped by an evil alternate version of Brian Braddock (issues #5-6, 1985) and had her eyes gouged out in issue #13 by the villain [[Slaymaster]] (1986).

In the ''[[New Mutants|New Mutants Annual #2]]'' (1986), Claremont made Braddock a character in the regular [[X-Men]] franchise. He wrote a story in which Braddock is abducted to the [[Mojoverse]], reduced to a brainwashed slave, fitted with [[bionic]] eyes and referred to as "Psylocke" for the first time. After being rescued by the New Mutants, Claremont let her join the X-Men and officially adopt the name "Psylocke" in the ''Uncanny X-Men #213'' issue (January 1987). 

At first, Braddock / Psylocke was portrayed as a pure telepath with little fighting skills, so that Claremont decided to have her wear body armor from issue #232 (August 1988) on. This changed in the #250-251 arc (1989, writer Claremont), where the X-Men are pursued by the racist "Reavers" terrorists and Braddock and her comrades escape through the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]], an extradimensional teleportation device. In the follow-up arc (#256-8, 1989-90, writer Claremont), it is revealed that Braddock has fallen prey to the Japanese [[Hand (comics)|Hand]] terrorists, who have brainwashed and physically altered her into becoming "Lady Mandarin", their supreme assassin. Due to her physical manipulation by the Hand, her outer appearance also shifted from her former English look into a face with Japanese features. After being saved by [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and overcoming her brainwash, she is now a superb fighter and no longer dependent on others in a fight. 

In the 1990s, matters with Braddock became confusing: in the ''X-Men (2nd series)'' comic book by Claremont and later [[Jim Lee]], Lee established that she became infatuated with her married team mate [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]: the flirting started in issue #8 (May 1992) and culiminated in #20 (May 1993), when Braddock tries to seduce him. But in that issue, Lee lets Braddock get raided by a woman called Kwannon, a.k.a. [[Revanche (comics)|Revanche]], who has the English features of the pre-Hand Elisabeth Braddock and claims that the "Japanese" Elisabeth Braddock is an imposter. After several plot twists, the #31-32 issues (1994, writer [[Fabian Nicieza]]) established that Kwannon originally was the Hand's leader [[Matsu'o Tsurabaya]]'s comatose lover: to save her, Tsurabaya has had comatose Kwannon and captive Braddock spliced. Kwannon later dies of the [[Legacy Virus]] and confirms Braddock is the real Psylocke. This physical and mental splicing was also used as the explanation why Braddock had been unusually flirty with Cyclops.

In 1994, writer [[Scott Lobdell]] set up a relationship between Braddock and her team mate [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]] in ''Uncanny X-Men #319'' (December 1994). Lobdell also temporatily took her out of the X-Men roster in issue #328 (January 1996), when she was almost mauled to death by a crazed [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]. Braddock returned to action in ''X-Men (2nd series) #77-78'' (1998, [[Joe Kelly]]), where she defeats the [[Shadow King]]. Years later, in issue #109 (February 2001), Claremont made her break up with Archangel and engage a relationship with new Indian X-Men recruit [[Neal Shaara]]. However, in ''[[X-Treme X-Men #2|X-Treme X-Men]]'' (August 2001), Claremont had her killed by the villain Vargas. Her [[comic book death]] lasted until ''Uncanny X-Men #455'' (April 2005) until he brought her back. She currently appears mainly in the ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' X-Men spin-off alternate universe series.

==Fictional character biography==
===Background===
[[Image:CaptainBritain13.jpg|185px|thumb|left|Betsy Braddock becomes the new [[Captain Britain]] in ''Captain Britain (vol. 2) #13''. Art by [[Alan Davis]].]]
Elisabeth "Betsy" Braddock was born in and raised in [[England]].  Born in the small town of [[Maldon, Essex]], Betsy and her brothers had a very privileged life.  She is the twin sister of Brian Braddock, better known as the superhero [[Captain Britain]] and first appeared in his eponymous series.  After working as a commercial pilot for some time, she dyes her hair purple, joins the Psi-Division of [[S.T.R.I.K.E.]]<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/strikeps.htm Psi-Division of S.T.R.I.K.E. (marvunapp.com)]</ref> (the British equivalent of the U.S.-based espionage outfit [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]), and goes undercover as a fashion [[model (person)|model]].  One of her assignments was to infiltrate the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], but [[Sage (comics)|Tessa]] forces her to abandon the mission.  A British crime lord, Vixen, hires [[Slaymaster]] to destroy the psi-division and he manages to kill all but Betsy, her lover Tom Lennox and their friend Alison Double. Captain Britain then defeats Slaymaster. 

When reality warped due to [[Mad Jim Jaspers|James Jaspers]]' powers, Tom sacrifices himself to give the Braddocks time to escape from a group of superhero hunters. Following the repair of the reality warp, an evil version of Captain Britain from another universe named Kaptain Briton switches places with Brian. The double hands him over to the [[Technet (comics)|Technet]] (who were after the Kaptain) and tries to rape Betsy.  In self-defense, she attacks him telepathically, killing him.

Betsy assumes his uniform and received training from Captain UK, another alternate Captain Britain, to become the new Captain while Brian was away working for the covert British agency [[R.C.X.]] This group had replaced the now defunct S.T.R.I.K.E.  Vixen lures Betsy into a trap, where Slaymaster beats her almost to death, gouging out her eyes.  Summoned by his sister's [[telepathy|telepathic]] distress call, Captain Britain crushes Slaymaster's head under a rock. Betsy recovered from her injuries, refusing an offer to have cybetnetic implants that would partially restore her vision. She learns to use her growing telepathic abilities to compensate for her blindness. The ordeal with Vixen and Slaymaster leaves Betsy feeling distant from her home, and she leaves for holiday in Switzerland.

===Joining the X-Men===   
[[Image:Bettylocke.png<U+200E>|frame|right|Psylocke as she appeared when she first joined the [[X-Men]]. Art by [[Alan Davis]].]]   
She was later kidnapped by the other-dimensional television producer [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]] and his henchwoman, the six-armed, cyborg sorceress [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]], and implanted with [[bionics|bionic]] eyes. Giving her the name "Psylocke", Mojo made her the star of the ''Wildways'' TV program. The [[New Mutants]], the teenage sister team of the X-Men, got involved rescuing Psylocke from Mojo and took her back with them to [[Westchester County, New York]]. She decided to stay with the [[X-Men]] and learn how to better control her powers. 

Psylocke assisted the X-Men in another battle with Mojo where the entire team was turned into children and mind-controlled into battling the New Mutants. The X-Men were reluctant to let Psylocke join them as her capacity as a teammate was unknown.  However, she had a chance to prove herself after the event known as the [[Mutant Massacre]]. [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], a member of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], invaded the mansion while the X-Men and New Mutants were away. Psylocke held her own against the deadly Sabretooth, keeping one step ahead of him until [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] arrived and kept Sabretooth locked in single combat. Psylocke took advantage of Sabretooth's distraction to read his mind and learn about the Marauders and their mysterious leader, [[Mister Sinister]]. The X-Men were impressed by Psylocke and in issue #213 of ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'', she joined the X-Men.

She was among the X-Men as they fought the [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]] in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] in the event known as ''[[Fall of the Mutants|The Fall of the Mutants]],'' wherein she was killed, resurrected, and subsequently transported to the [[Australia]]n [[Outback]] by [[Roma (comics)|Roma]]. After a fight with the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]], Psylocke donned body [[armour]] to protect herself in physical confrontations. When Storm was thought killed in a fight with the entity called [[Nanny (comics)|Nanny]], Psylocke briefly took over as the leader of the few X-Men still remaining in Australia.

While in the [[Savage Land]], Psylocke experienced a precognitive vision that warned her of the potential fate of the four remaining X-Men (herself, [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], [[Dazzler]], and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]); should they return to their base in the Australian Outback, the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] would kill them, and attempt unsuccessfully to transform Psylocke into a cyborg. However, shortly thereafter, the four heroes were teleported back to Australia by [[Gateway (comics)| Gateway]]. The light from his portal alerted the Reavers to their return. As the Reavers closed in, Psylocke activated the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]] portal, given to the X-Men by Roma as a last resort. Beings who entered the portal were cosmically judged and reborn into another life, given a "clean slate". Psylocke saw it as the only way to save her teammates lives and her own. Dazzler and Colossus entered willingly, but Havok hesitated, feeling as though he was abandoning his responsibilities. Psylocke, left with no alternative, telepathically "convinced" him that his actions were justified. Psylocke entered the portal at the last moment, as the Reavers arrived to kill her and her teammates.

===Transformed===
[[Image:Uncanny256.jpg|215px|thumb|left|Psylocke is transformed into Lady Mandarin in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]] #256''.<br>Art by [[Jim Lee]].]]
After emerging from the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]], Psylocke was found by the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]], a [[ninja]] clan. Their leader, [[Matsu'o Tsurayaba]], had contacted Spiral in order to save the life of his brain-damaged lover, [[Revanche|Kwannon]]. Spiral informed Matsu'o that Psylocke's telepathy could restore Kwannon, and Matsu'o accepted. Unknown to Matsu'o, however, Spiral actually placed the two women's minds into each other's bodies. She also merged their genetic structures, leaving both women with physical and mental traits of the other, and with each possessing half of Psylocke's telepathic power. 

With some physical and mental conditioning, Psylocke (inhabiting Kwannon's body) became the Hand's prime assassin, taking the name Lady Mandarin. As Lady Mandarin, she alternated between a new armored costume and a more revealing one. She gained highly remarkable fighting skills and learned to focus her telepathic power into a "psychic knife" which appeared as a dagger of energy projecting outward from her fist. Lady Mandarin's first mission pitted her against [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. Betsy's psychic knife attack revealed Wolverine's memories of who she used to be and allowed her to break free from the Hand's conditioning. Psylocke rejected her role as Lady Mandarin and escaped with Wolverine and [[Jubilation Lee|Jubilee]], eventually going with them to the island nation of [[Genosha]].

In Genosha, Psylocke, Wolverine, and Jubilee discovered that the New Mutants had been kidnapped along with the X-Men's leader, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], by [[Cameron Hodge]] (a former advisor to the team of the X-Men's founding students calling themselves X-Factor). Psylocke, Wolverine, and Jubilee also encountered [[Havok (X-Men)|Havok]], whom Psylocke had psychically nudged through the Siege Perilous, acting as a Magistrate (one of Genosha's gestapo-like military police officers). Following the defeat of Cameron Hodge, the X-Men reunited and returned to [[New York]].

After the X-Men split into two teams, Psylocke joined [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]' Blue Team. During this time she displayed an obvious attraction to Cyclops. When [[Jean Grey|Phoenix]] found out, the two women fought, but were interrupted by the arrival of Kwannon, now calling herself [[Revanche]], in Betsy's former body. Revanche claimed to be the real Betsy, and not even Wolverine's enhanced senses could tell them apart. Further, attempts to gain an explanation from Matsu'o and Lord Nyoirin were unsuccessful. Eventually, Revanche revealed that she had contracted the [[Legacy Virus]] and explained to Psylocke what Spiral had done at Tsurayaba's request. Dying, Revanche requested that Matsu'o kill her before the virus could claim her. Upon Kwannon's death, Psylocke's full telepathic potential was returned to her. Revanche left Matsu'o with small portion of her psionic power, allowing him to remove Kwannon's fractured memories and personality traits from Psylocke's mind, and to restore those of Betsy's that were possessed by Kwannon (though, somehow Psylocke was able to retain Revanche's martial arts skill). 

Afterwards, Jean Grey re-trained Betsy in the use of her telepathic powers. She also began a relationship with Warren Worthington III, the [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]].

===Crimson Dawn===  	 		
In an attempt to save [[Tabitha Smith]] from Sabretooth, who had been living at the Mansion while pretending to be mentally handicapped, Psylocke engaged the homicidal mutant in battle. Although a highly skilled martial artist, she was no physical match for Sabretooth. Realizing she had no other choice, she attacked him with her psychic blade.  Unfortunately, Creed had been stabbed in the head by [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], losing the part of his brain affected by psionics, so her attack had no effect. Psylocke was already exhausted from their battle and could not manage to fight back, and was consequently mauled by Sabretooth. Her injuries were near-fatal; even Beast and the advanced [[Shi'ar]] technology of the Xavier Institute could not stabilize her.

In a bid to save her life, [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] went with [[Doctor Strange]] into the [[Crimson Dawn]] to retrieve a magical liquid that could heal her. The mission was successful, reviving Psylocke from the brink of death. The healing liquid produced side effects: a red dagger-shaped [[tattoo]] appeared over her left eye, her telepathy and fighting skills were enhanced, and she gained the ability to hide in and teleport through [[shadow]]s. Her personality took on a cold edge; the change in her personality and abilities created distance between her and Warren. Meanwhile, the Proctor of the Crimson Dawn, Tar, was defeated by the demon Kuragari. Kuragari seized the throne of the Crimson Dawn and used the debt from the magical elixir to transform Psylocke into his undercloak queen. Shortly thereafter, Gomurr the Ancient (who had helped Archangel, Wolverine, and Dr. Strange obtain the elixir) found a dying Tar and became the true leader of the Crimson Dawn. Gomurr came to Warren and told him that the debt from the elixir was not Psylocke's to repay, but Warren's. Warren gave up a portion of his essence to free Psylocke from Kuragari's control, and the couple defeated him. Psylocke still retained the abilities associated with the Crimson Dawn due to the fact that she had been touched by the Crimson Dawn and therefore would remain a part of it. Soon after these events, the couple retired from active duty with the X-Men. (For further elaboration on her adventures concerning this, see the article "[[Crimson Dawn]]".)

===Psi-War===
Psylocke later battled the powerful psychic enity known as the [[Shadow King]] in a fight that caused telepaths across the globe to temporarily lose their powers, and resulted in the permanent loss of Psylocke's own telepathic abilities after she defeated and trapped the Shadow King inside her mind.<ref>X-Men #77-78</ref>

[[Image:Xm078.png|thumb|left|Psylocke battles against the [[Shadow King]].<br>Cover to ''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #78. Art by German Garcia.]]
The story began when Storm received a mystical message from her adoptive mother Ainet, who was desperately asking for her help.  Storm called on Psylocke and they, together with Wolverine, and a group of untrained X-Men traveled through Psylocke<U+2019>s teleportation-shadow.  After arriving through the <U+201C>shadow-port<U+201D>, Psylocke and Wolverine found themselves fighting sand-warriors in the air.  Landing on the ground, Psylocke and Wolverine began analyzing the situation until Logan disappeared into the sand.  Psylocke then made her journey back into the village, where the Ananasi had taken all but Storm as his prisoner.  Psylocke asserted herself by splitting the body of the Ananasi in two, using her psychic knife.  She explained to a shocked Storm that she had been <U+201C>up to her armpits<U+201D> fighting sand-warriors. 

After a quick telepathic scan of Ainet, Psylocke concluded that their enemy was a high order telepath but was interrupted by an attacking Ananasi.  When Storm asked Psylocke who he was, Betsy answered that she couldn<U+2019>t breach his psychic defenses directly.  The Ananasi then began to taunt Psylocke by bringing up all the times that she had been manipulated in one form or another, so she decided to take the fight directly to him, on the astral plane.  There she and Storm encountered the rest of Storm<U+2019>s people, who where arranged in a specific pattern.

Once again, the Ananasi appeared and a mighty battle ensued between him and Psylocke, which ended up with Psylocke being lured into plunging her psychic knife into the slaved minds of the villagers, releasing an enormous shockwave throughout the psionic plane which crippled telepaths around the planet and disfigured Psylocke<U+2019>s astral form. With victory at hand, the Ananasi took off his mask and revealed himself to be the Shadow King, one of the X-Men<U+2019>s deadliest foes.

After their battle, the Shadow King destroyed Psylocke<U+2019>s psychic form and left her for dead.  Thanks to the Crimson Dawn though, Betsy survived and emerged in a new shadow form with new abilities.  She helped Ainet escape from the Shadow King<U+2019>s psychic prison and together they found and rescued Storm as well.  Psylocke, sensing that her shadow form was invisible to the Shadow King, turned Storm and Ainet into shadows as well before going back for her final confrontation with the Shadow King himself.  While Storm and Ainet set up to rescue the captured X-Men, Psylocke held the Shadow King as long as she could.  When she couldn<U+2019>t keep the others covered any longer, she sent them back into the corporeal world, claiming her alliance to the Shadow King.  The Shadow King did not believe her and after taking Psylocke as his prisoner, he set up to take over the minds of all the people around the world.  After tricking the Shadow King into over-extending himself, Psylocke created shadow tendrils that honed into the Shadow King's unprotected, personal nexus.  Once the tendrils had separated the Shadow King from his power, Psylocke could contain his soul within the shadows of the psi-plane.  To keep the Shadow King imprisoned, Psylocke had to keep her telepathic powers permanently focused on containing him and thus effectively lost the use of her telepathy.

===Power switch===
[[Image:PsylockeRevolution.jpg|175px|thumb|right|Psylocke dons a new costume after gaining her telekinesis.]]
In [[Chris Claremont]]'s second stint as an ''X-Men'' scribe, a six-month story gap was created, and it was during this gap that Phoenix's and Psylocke's powers were switched somehow; Psylocke's telepathic powers were added to Phoenix's telepathy, whose psi-form now took the shape of Betsy<U+2019>s former shadow psi-form,<ref>Uncanny X-men #381</ref> while Psylocke gained Phoenix's telekinesis.<ref>[http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/article/showquestion.asp?faq=4&fldAuto=90 : Welcome to UXN - For the Fans, by the Fans :<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Afterwards, Psylocke returned to active duty. The effects of the power-switch were first seen when Psylocke used her new powers to help repair the High Evolutionary<U+2019>s former satellite base.<ref>X-Men (2nd Series) #100</ref> She also used her telekinesis to hold together a space shuttle that the X-Men used as a vehicle, when they escaped from the exploding satellite.<ref>X-Men (2nd Series) #101</ref>

As a telekinetic she confronted several new enemies to the X-Men; the Neo, the Crimson Pirates, the Goth, and the Twisted Sisters. She also helped her brother to free Otherworld from Mastermind<U+2019>s Warpie army.<ref>Excalibur: Sword of Power #1-4</ref>

She soon started flirting with her teammate Neal Shaara, [[Neal Shaara|Thunderbird III]], which led to Warren breaking up with her, as he wanted a more stable relationship than what he and Betsy currently had.<ref>X-Men (2nd Series) #109</ref> After the breakup she decided to join Storm and her new X-Men team.

===X-Treme X-Men and Death===
Psylocke then joined [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]'s team, the [[X-Treme X-Men]], to search for [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]]'s diaries.  On one of the team's first missions, she died in combat with the man known as [[Vargas (comics)|Vargas]] while protecting [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], who were badly beaten by the villain.

Her spirit appeared to [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] in a vision, but she was grabbed by a skull-faced apparition and pulled through a glowing portal.

Brian Braddock and Meggan collected Psylocke's body from Spain. She was buried at the Braddock family estate and a memorial to her was erected at the [[X-Mansion]] by Beast.

===Back From The Dead===
One year after her death, Psylocke inexplicably reappeared alive and unharmed in the exact place where she was killed in Spain. She was placed under arrest by the Spanish government, and the X-Men were contacted to collect her. After her resurrection the red Crimson Dawn mark was gone from her face. Her original telepathic powers, however, were not returned to her; she still possessed the telekinetic abilities she had gained from Jean Grey, but they had greatly increased in strength. Even [[Rachel Summers]], a skilled and powerful telekinetic, could not overcome her. Shortly after her return, she and the rest of the X-Men found themselves in an adventure in the [[Savage Land]]. During this mission, Psylocke displayed more creative uses for her powers, most notably the augmentation of her physical strength by using her telekinesis to back up her attacks.

Upon returning from the Savage Land, medical tests by the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] conducted at the [[X-Mansion]] proved that she was indeed Betsy Braddock. She officially rejoined the team and was reunited with her other teammates. After the House of M ended, it was revealed that Betsy was one of the [[X-Men: The 198|198]], the group of mutants who had retained their powers after M-Day.

===The Forsaken===
In the first part of ''The First Forsaken'' story arc, it was revealed that one year after her murder by Vargas, Psylocke was brought back to life by her eldest brother, [[Jamie Braddock]].  Jamie, a mutant who manipulates the [[String theory|quantum strings]] that comprise reality, claimed that when he resurrected his sister, he also made her immune to the [[reality warping]] abilities of other beings and impervious to mind control and psychic possession.  Jamie claimed these steps were necessary in order to make Psylocke a weapon against the "Forsaken," who threaten all of creation, just before a mysterious portal opened and a horrified Jamie was spirited-away by strange, monstrous hands.  [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] took Marvel Girl, Psylocke, [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] to Central Park.  All but Psylocke were kidnapped by the Forsaken, the supposed end of the universe and Jamie Braddock's best friends. 

As Psylocke was the wild card (she could not be detected), it was up to her to stop this.  She disrupted the Forsaken's magic with iron, and she, the X-Men, and the Forsaken were sucked elsewhere.  She woke up in a strange city and met the First Fallen; a being who looked like an ancient Egyptian soldier with wings.  He took her to the other X-Men, who were being lectured by the Forsaken, saying that they were trying to offer "eternal peace" to people on Earth, like the people of their city had.  However, only four of each species existed, with the First Fallen saying any more would be redundant.  They and all the inhabitants in the city were under the sway of the First Fallen, who they learned from [[Watcher (comics)|the Watcher]] is actually the male counterpart to the Phoenix Force, an entity whose goal is eternal unchangeable perfection, who invades the worlds of those who wish for perfection, taking four of every species into his own world.  He had also cancelled everyone's powers except Psylocke's, with her immunity.  She, in turn, used her psychic katana to short-circuit his power, and everyone rebelled, when the First Fallen itself vacated its host body, preparing to attack them all.  Jamie Braddock at that point decided to send everyone home and he locked himself in the First Fallen's dimension.

===Return of the Shadow King===
After accompanying the other X-Men to Africa to help [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] liberate the locals under the dictatorship of Shetani, Psylocke visited [[Excalibur (comics)#New Excalibur (2005)|New Excalibur]] in London to talk with her brother Brian over what happened with Jamie.<ref>New Excalibur #8</ref> During their conversation a holographic image of Peter Wisdom appeared, informing her that the alternate reality version of Charles Xavier whom the Excalibur team (and Betsy) had previously met, had awakened and was asking for her. Psylocke and the Excalibur team met up with [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] at the compound that held the body of Professor X, discussing what they would do next. Deciding that Betsy would enter the room that held the Professors body while the Juggernaut would act as backup, Psylocke was suddenly confronted by the astral image of her old foe, the Shadow King. Though she told him that he couldn<U+2019>t enter her mind, he answered that he didn<U+2019>t have to, knowing her from the inside out after his imprisonment. He also explained to Psylocke that her mind had after her death, been pulled by the strings of reality itself, while he had been transported to an alternate universe. Suddenly aware that the others were under the Shadow Kings influence, Sage tried unsuccessfully to stop them from ambushing Captain Britain, but failed to do so. With Sage down, and Captain Britain brutally beaten by his possessed teammates, a vengeful Shadow King taunted Betsy of being helpless to save her friends due to her mind-blind status. After having questioned that statement, Psylocke created a telekinetic bubble in Dark Xavier's brain to give the Shadow King's hosts body a [[stroke]]. This freed the others from his control, but when Psylocke delivered the killing blow with her katana, she vanished in a flash of light. Since then, no one has noticed her absence, except for [[Captain Britain]], who believes her to be dead.

===Joining the Exiles===

{{seealso|Exiles (Marvel Comics)}}
In [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] #90, Psylocke appeared in Panoptichron to replace [[Power Princess]]. However, upon arrival, she clashes with Sabretooth, thinking him to be the 616 Sabretooth that nearly killed her twice. They fight for a while, but eventually Psylocke catches on to the fact that Sabretooth is not there for a fight and [[Morph (comics)|Morph]] intervenes and makes an introduction. Surprisingly, Psylocke cannot be detected by any of Panoptichron's cameras. Heather teleports Morph, Sabretooth, and Psylocke down to Earth #1720 to save the other Exiles where Betsy meets an alternate Slaymaster which opens up an old wound and makes her fail the mission of killing [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], leading to the world being deleted, and subsequently restored by Reed. Psylocke has recovered from wounds that that world's Wolverine inflicted on her and has decided to stay on Panoptichron while the other Exiles go to their next mission.

===Future===
Psylocke took part in the 5-issue mini-series ''[[X-Men: Die by the Sword]]'', a cross-over between Exiles and [[Excalibur (comics)#New Excalibur (2005)|New Excalibur]] debuting with issues #1 and #2 in October<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/marvelnew/Oct07/solicitations.html NEWSARAMA.COM: MARVEL COMICS SOLICITATIONS FOR OCTOBER 2007<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. She remains with the new Exile team (in 2008).

Psylocke originally possessed the power of [[telepathy]], able to perform the same feats as other telepaths of the time ([[Professor X]], [[Jean Grey]], [[Rachel Summers]], [[Emma Frost]], etc.) She could read and project thoughts over long distances;<ref>Uncanny X-Men #221</ref> control minds;<ref>Uncanny X-Men 238</ref> project mental illusions;<ref>Uncanny X-Men 217</ref> generate psi-bolts that could stun,<ref>Fantastic Four Vs. the X-Men (Paperback, 1991)</ref> injure,<ref>Uncanny X-Men 236</ref> or kill others.<ref>Captain Britain Monthly #6</ref> She could also project her astral self, and the astral bodies of other people, into the [[astral plane]].<ref>Uncanny X-Men #243</ref> She could scan entire towns with her mind,<ref>Uncanny X-Men #229</ref> and leaf through the psyches of the inhabitants of a city to learn of their condition<ref>Uncanny X-Men #218</ref> or intentions.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #216</ref> She could also probe individuals to check up on their status.<ref>X-Men (2nd Series) #6</ref> 

[[Image:Uxm251pg15.png|left|100px|frame|Psylocke's psionic butterfly aura]]			
When using her powers (during her run in Uncanny X-Men), a butterfly-shaped energy aura would appear around her face. It was never truly made clear in the comic books by the writers whether this was something that could be perceived by others or if this was simply an 'effect' to show when Psylocke was using her powers to the reading audience. This 'butterfly' (sometimes depicted as having eyes in its wings) was also the form Psylocke usually took when manifesting her astral form, both on the astral plane,<ref>Uncanny X-Men #236</ref> and in the physical world;<ref>Fantastic Four Vs. the X-Men (Paperback, 1991)</ref> although she occasionally used an illusory image of her physical body.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #243</ref> After her transformation, Psylocke's psi-form changed to reflect her new Asian appearance.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #273</ref><ref>Wolverine (2nd Series) #147</ref>
 			
In addition, Psylocke could also use her telepathy to project a focused beam of directed psionic energy into a 'psycho-blast'. While the blast functioned much like a typical telepathic attack, it was also able to affect physical matter; when Psylocke used her psycho-blast on Sabretooth to defend herself from his attack, the telepathic blast also shattered the Cerebro metal helmet that she was wearing at the time.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #213</ref> The psycho-blast could also pierce the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]'s psi-proof helmet<ref>Uncanny X-Men #218</ref>, a feat that Professor Xavier himself could not accomplish when he first met his transformed brother.<ref>X-Men (1st Series) #13</ref>

Psylocke also possessed limited [[precognition|precognitive]] powers that occasionally allowed her to envision probable future events,<ref>Uncanny X-Men #250</ref> or to see quick flashes of the future.<ref>X-Men (2nd series) # 5</ref> However, these visions were random and infrequent, and she had no control over them.

While in her original body, Psylocke was given bionic eyes by Mojo and Spiral which instantly adjusted to any intensity of light, preventing her from being blinded by brightness.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #217</ref> The bionic eyes were also cameras, transmitting to Mojo everything that Psylocke saw.<ref>Uncanny X-Men Annual #10</ref>

For a time, Betsy took the role of Captain Britain from her brother, using the deceased Kaptain Briton's costume which had been modified by the Mastermind computer. This costume gave her superhuman strength and the ability to fly.<ref>Captain Britain Monthly - series</ref>

===Body Swap===
After her physical transformation into an Asian ninja assassin she gained highly developed fighting skills in addition to her telepathy, which at this stage was not as powerful as it had originally been before her transformation, due to sharing half her power with [[Revanche]].<ref>X-Men (2nd series) #32</ref><ref>X-Men (20 series) #34</ref> After [[Revanche]]'s death, Psylocke's full telepathic might was restored to its previous strength.  The most common usage of her powers was the manifestation of a "psychic knife," described as the focused totality of her psychic powers, which she often used to disrupt the neurons of her foes by driving the glowing "blade" of psionic energy into their heads.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #257</ref> During this time she chose to fight up-close most of the time, using her new martial arts skills, although she could still utilize distanced telepathic assaults.<ref>X-Men (2nd series) #1</ref> At least once, she experienced a precognitive flash while in her new body.<ref>X-Men (2nd series) # 5</ref>

After her exposure to the Crimson Dawn, she also gained the ability to [[teleportation in fiction|teleport]] herself and others using areas of shadow as gateways.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #338</ref> The teleportation could cover huge distances; on one occasion she transported the X-Men from America to [[Africa]] in a few seconds.<ref>X-Men (2nd series) #77</ref> She could also teleport through the shadows of other dimensions.<ref>Psylocke & Archangel Crimson Dawn # 4</ref> Psylocke has not been seen using this ability since her imprisonment of the Shadow King in the astral plane;<ref>X-Men (2nd series) #78</ref> during a mission against Stryfe, she mentioned to Nightcrawler that she no longer possessed this ability.<ref>X-Men Annual (2nd series) 2000</ref>

===Current powers===
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Psylocke-bigcostume9.jpg|170px|thumb|House of M Psylocke]]  -->To keep the Shadow King imprisoned in the Astral Plane, Psylocke sacrificed the use of her telepathy, but at some point gained [[Jean Grey|Phoenix]]'s [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]] instead.<ref>[http://stason.org/TULARC/art/comics-xbooks/53-When-did-Psylocke-and-Phoenix-switch-powers-Wasn-t-Psylo.html 53 When did Psylocke and Phoenix switch powers? Wasn't Psylocke telepathically holding the Shadow King captive?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> At first, due to the relative newness of her telekinesis, she couldn't exercise fine control over her powers, e.g. she could blast an enemy through a brick wall, but couldn't levitate small objects, like a dime from the floor.<ref>X-Men (2nd series) #103</ref> As time progressed, Psylocke grew more proficient at using her powers, she could e.g. use her telekinesis to reshape a pistol into smaller metal projectiles.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #473</ref>  Instead of her psychic knife, Psylocke began to manifest a telekinetic [[katana]] composed of raw psionic energy.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #385</ref> At its lowest intensity her katana functions much like her psychic knife once did, short-circuiting the victim's nervous system on impact.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #473</ref> At its highest level, the katana can slice through almost any physical matter.<ref>X-Treme X-Men #2</ref> Psylocke's control over the katana is such that she can slice an armored opponent and cut through the armor, but only leave her opponent stunned or unconscious.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #456</ref> Psylocke's telekinetic manifestations produce visible radiance in the physical world.<ref>mentioned by Hank McCoy in X-treme X-Men #2</ref> Thus, she can use her psychic katana as a makeshift light source in areas of darkness. The katana can also affect beings that are more powerful than Psylocke herself.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #472</ref><ref>Uncanny X-Men #474</ref><ref>X-Men; The End <U+2013> Book 3, #6</ref>

She can also use her sword to shatter telepathic power-inhibitors imposed on others, despite her own lack of telepathy.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #458</ref> With no telepathy to guide her when performing this task, she must rely on her instincts to give the blade the sufficient strength necessary to break the inhibitors, without doing permanent damage to the subject in question. During the timeline shift known as [[House of M]], Psylocke showed the ability to summon two telekinetic katanas at the same time.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #464</ref> It is unknown if she is capable of this under normal circumstances. 

Aside from the blade, Psylocke can use her telekinesis to enhance her speed, strength, and fighting skills to superhuman levels.<ref>Exiles #91</ref> She can also levitate herself and others,<ref>X-Treme X-Men #2</ref> or manipulate matter in standard telekinetic fashion.<ref>X-Men (2nd Series) #105</ref> She can also create telekinetic shields of various sizes and strength,<ref>Uncanny X-Men #471</ref> and her telekinesis have been said to be strong enough to shatter mountains.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #463</ref> After her resurrection, Psylocke's telekinetic powers have been greatly enhanced.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #457-458</ref> At the time of Betsy's resurrection, Marvel Girl claimed that Psylocke's telekinesis was on a level even she couldn't match.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #455</ref>

After her resurrection, Psylocke was shown to be immune to all forms of psionic manipulations such as mind-reading,<ref>Uncanny X-Men #455</ref> mind-control or mental attacks,<ref>Uncanny X-Men #458-#459</ref> and attempts of telepathic communication.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #468</ref> This is a result of her brother Jamie's manipulation of the quantum strings that comprise her body.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #472</ref> She is also immune or at least highly resistant to other psionic-based powers like the [[Savage Land Mutates|Savage Land Mutate]] [[Vertigo (Marvel Comics)|Vertigo's]] disorientation power,<ref>Uncanny X-Men #458</ref> or [[Nocturne (comics)|Nocturne's]] mind possessing abilities.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #463</ref> Due to Jamie's alterations, Psylocke is also immune to any physical and mental alteration by beings who can radically restructure reality, such as [[Proteus (comics)|Proteus]]. She can, however, still be killed in more traditional manners, such as being stabbed or shot. She is also at least partially resistant to magical manipulation.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #461</ref> Psylocke is unable to alter or reduce her psychic immunity, or to undo any of the changes made to her by her brother. 

Psylocke also appears to have recently gained the power to somehow render herself invisible, though to what extent she can control this ability is currently not known.<ref>Exiles #92</ref>

It is not known if Psylocke still retains her precognitive power.

===Fighting skills===
Psylocke has been classified as a master martial artist, though the specific fighting arts she has mastered have never been revealed. Psylocke's fighting skills and techniques have been shown to surpass those of the average Hand ninja,<ref>Uncanny X-Men #257</ref> or Crimson Dawn Undercloak,<ref>Psylocke & Archangel Crimson Dawn #2</ref> and have been said to rival those of a ninja master.<ref>Psylocke & Archangel Crimson Dawn #3</ref>

As a telepath, Psylocke could take advantage of her powers in a fight by reading her opponents' movements seconds before they made them giving her the opportunity to counter-attack faster.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #257</ref> She could also use her telepathy to mask her presence from other people, humans and superhumans alike, e.g. from Wolverine's super-enhanced senses,<ref>Wolverine (vol.2) #125</ref> or from Jean Grey's telepathy.<ref>X-Men (2nd) series #1</ref> She could also create telepathic illusions to distract her enemies while fighting them,<ref>Uncanny X-Men #239</ref> and as a ninja, she used her psychic knife to incapacitate her opponents instead of killing them;<ref>Uncanny X-Men #257</ref> although she will kill her opponents if she finds it to be necessary.<ref>X-Men (vol. 2) Annual 2000</ref>  

As a telekinetic, she often uses her powers to augment her strength and speed,<ref>X-Men (2nd series) #105</ref> making her fighting skills strong enough to match, and even outmatch other superhumanly strong opponents, like e.g. a holographic version of Sabretooth in the Danger Room.<ref>X-Men (2nd series) #103</ref><ref>Uncanny X-Men #460</ref> During a training session with Rogue and Thunderbird, Psylocke was able to match Rogue<U+2019>s attacks despite the fact that Rogue had greatly enhanced speed and strength at the time.<ref>''X-treme X-Men'' #3</ref>

===Body Armor===
[[Image:Wolverine n5-p13.jpg|185px|thumb|right|Lindsay McCabe explains how the armor works]]
During the time when the X-Men were based in the Australian outback, Psylocke gained possession of a unique suit of armor. Made of an unknown metal, it was lightweight and form-fitting, yet extremely resistant to physical damage, giving Psylocke an added protection to her physical body.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #232</ref> The armor was also resistant to projectiles and energy weapons.<ref>Wolverine (2nd Series) #5;first appearance of the armor</ref> [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] had the armor custom-ordered through a weapons and technology firm named Landau, Luckman & Lake for "a colleague". Mr. Chang, an agent of Landau, Luckman & Lake, loaned the armor to Lindsay McCabe since Wolverine had sent her to him. [[Jessan Hoan|Tyger Tiger]] also wore the body armor for a short time,<ref>Wolverine (2nd) #6-7</ref> and she was briefly trapped in the armor due to a built-in security mechanism, which Wolverine managed to free her from. After travelling through the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]] and trading bodies with [[Revanche|Kwannon]], Psylocke no longer used the body armor. When Kwannon, in Betsy's original body, returned to Xavier's mansion, she was wearing an armor that was similar to the one Betsy used to wear, but it has never been officially stated whether or not this armor was Psylocke<U+2019>s original one.<ref>X-Men (2nd Series) #20</ref>

==Relationships==
Elisabeth Braddock has been involved in a series of relationships during the years. As a member of S.T.R.I.K.E.'s Psi Division, she was involved with fellow agent Tom Lennox. He was murdered while trying to defend her, during which time she was psi-linked to him. Telepathically experiencing Lennox's death left Betsy traumatized for a time.<ref>Mighty World of Marvel #8-9</ref>

While Elisabeth in her earliest days as an X-Man shared a mutual attraction for the teenage [[New Mutants|New Mutant]] known as [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]], neither Betsy nor Doug acted on their feelings.<ref>Uncanny X-Men Annual #10</ref>

After returning to the X-Men in Kwannon's body, Psylocke mentally manipulated [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], her team leader, into being attracted to her.<ref>X-Men (2nd series) #20</ref> After regaining her full personality from Kwannon, Psylocke offered a belated apology to Jean, admitting that the flirtation was due to the presence of Kwannon's lingering personality traits in her mind, but that she did in fact find Cyclops attractive.<ref>X-Men (2nd series) #38</ref>

Later, Elisabeth and [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] had a relationship, but chose to end it after realizing that they were too different to stay together.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #319</ref><ref>X-Men (2nd series) #109</ref> After Betsy's death, Archangel suffered anguish from being unable to save her, but eventually made peace with it and moved on to a relationship with [[Husk (comics)|Paige Guthrie]].<ref>Uncanny X-Men #440</ref> 

Psylocke and the X-Man [[Neal Shaara]] were romantically involved until her death.<ref>X-Treme X-Men #3</ref>

So far, neither Warren Worthington 's nor Neal Shaara's reaction to Elisabeth's resurrection have been depicted or spoken of, despite having both Elisabeth and Warren fighting the villain [[Ghoul (comics)|Ghoul]] together, alongside other X-Men, in ''Generation M''.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
[[Image:Psylocke-aoa.jpg|215px|thumb|right|The ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' incarnation of Psylocke.]]
Originally, Psylocke was the only X-Man not depicted in some form or another in the X-Men crossover "[[Age of Apocalypse]]". However, for "AoA"'s 10th anniversary, a new miniseries was created and Psylocke made an appearance for the first time since the original "AoA" miniseries. Psylocke in the "Age of Apocalypse" appears as a ninja, with black hair and blue eyes. She is a telepath, and an old acquaintance of Weapon X. It also appears that Psylocke has an affinity for the shadows but bears no Crimson Dawn mark over her eye, as her "616" counterpart once did. This "AoA" version of Psylocke shows the ability to manifest two psychic knives at the same time, which are able to affect physical matter, as can be seen in ''X-Men: AoA'' #4, where she cuts the chains binding Charles Lensherr. An official explanation for Psylocke's Asian appearance, various powers, and fighting skills in the AOA universe has not been depicted.  

Psylocke's appearance is first noted by a captured Logan, who spots her glowing eyes in the nearby shadows. Psylocke then releases Charles from his chains and helps the rest of the captured group escape. She has a brief reunion with Logan, for whom she bears an obvious grudge, and battles [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Dagger]], defeating her quickly. Psylocke later uses her psychic blades to counteract the brainwashing of some of the X-Men, first on Jean, who is released from Mr. Sinister's influence, and then on [[X-23|Kirika]], which allows the young mutant to remember that Logan and [[Mariko Yashida]] are her parents. At the end of the series, Psylocke leaves for the refugee colony of New Japan with [[X-23#Age of Apocalypse|Kirika]], [[Silver Samurai]], and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]].

===Days of Future Past===
Psylocke has been present in two [[Days of Future Past]]-storylines, one which took place in ''Wolverine: Days of Future Past'' #1-3 and the other one in ''Excalibur'' (vol. 1) #94. In W: DoFP, Psylocke has not only the Crimson Dawn tattoo over her left eye, but also additional tattoos on the right part of her face. In the E: DoFP story, Psylocke has no tattoos at all and her eyes are completely blue, with no visible iris or pupils. One thing that connects these two storylines with each other and with the original DoFP, is the death of Warren Worthington.

In ''Excalibur (vol. 1) #94'', Psylocke is a member of the underground resistance against [[Black Air]], the British Security Service that rules Britain. She is first seen walking into the computer area under Braddock Mansion. She<U+2019>s part of the Excalibur team that goes on a mission to rescue [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Douglock]] from the Black Air headquarters. Inside the Black Air HQ, Psylocke fights off [[techno-organic material|techno-organic]] [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] replicas and uses her psychic knife to open up a neural linked brain-lock. Inside the lock room, she finds herself trapped together with the rest of the team. What happens to her afterwards is unknown.

In ''Wolverine: Days of Future Past #1'', Psylocke is first seen as a mysterious hooded female that sneaks up undetected behind Logan and telepathically destroys his consciousness. It isn<U+2019>t until the final panel that the mysterious woman is revealed to be Psylocke, the new Red Queen and one of the Lords Cardinal of the new [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. In ''issue 2'', Psylocke is seen by [[Shinobi Shaw]]<U+2019>s side as they watch the trapped [[Scarlet Witch]]. As Shinobi brags about world domination, Betsy reminds him that without her help he wouldn<U+2019>t have been so lucky and warns him about celebrating a victory in advance. He tells her that her name is never far away from his thoughts and that they will rule the world side by side. Suddenly, Psylocke cries out in pain and informs Shinobi that Wolverine has reawakened and that [[Emma Frost]] is responsible for bringing him back.

Psylocke summons Midnight (the female ninja that accompanied her to Moscow in ''issue 1'') and she instructs her to kill Wolverine. Betsy asks her if she has any problems with betraying Logan considering their past together, to which Midnight responds that betrayal comes easily nowadays. Elisabeth doesn<U+2019>t respond and instead smiles at Midnight, reminding her that they all have known defeat in the past. 

In ''issue 3'', [[Baron Zemo]] makes his way back to Shinobi and Elisabeth to celebrate their victory, just as [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] makes his way into their base. A panicking Betsy yells to Shinobi to do something, and he tells her that the computer-defenses will soon be activated. Suddenly Betsy senses betrayal from one of the workers, whom she stuns with her psychic knife. She smiles as she finds out that the worker was [[Jubilation Lee#Days of Future Past|Jubilee]] in disguise. As she<U+2019>s preparing to kill Jubilee, [[Synch (comics)|Synch]] and [[Leech (comics)|Leech]] use their combined powers against Psylocke to intervene. Wolverine finally knocks her down with one punch, commenting that during the years she has grown a bit <U+201C>rusty<U+201D> with her martial arts skills. She<U+2019>s taken back to Emma Frost<U+2019>s base of operation and Emma later tells Jubilee and the rest of the team, that Betsy will be transferred back to her brother in England as soon as her recuperation is completed.

===Earth X===
It is unknown if the Betsy Braddock version of the Earth X future timeline never switched bodies with the Asian assassin Kwannon or if the effect was undone somehow, but she was entirely Caucasian when she was brought to Otherworld to further hone her telepathic and precognitive powers under Merlyn<U+2019>s and Roma<U+2019>s tutelage. Her abilities boosted, Psylocke<U+2019>s telepathic signature, the butterfly image, was much bigger than before and constantly <U+201C>on,<U+201D> bathing her head in bright, pink light. Her training completed, she rejoined her brother, King Britain, on Earth at some later point, as she, Merlyn and Doctor Strange used their powers to weaken Mephisto, allowing Brian to kill him.

===House of M===
In the [[House of M]] reality created by the Scarlet Witch, Betsy found herself as Princess Royal, sister to the monarch of England. In fact, Betsy was actually the rightful heir of the throne, being a few minutes older than her twin brother Brian, but she had stepped down in his favor, as she preferred traveling and adventuring with her [[lady-in-waiting]], [[Rachel Grey]].

===[[MC2]]===
Although not seen on-panel, Psylocke<U+2019>s counterpart of the MC2 universe was at least mentioned. Apparently, this Psylocke acted as a godmother to [[Wild Thing (comics)|Wild Thing]], the daughter of Wolverine and [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], and she also trained her in the use of her psychic powers. Wild Thing had no real claws but psionic ones that she could use in similar ways as Psylocke her psychic katana.

===Ultimate Psylocke===

In the World Tour story arc of ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'', Agent Betsy Braddock, along with her partner Agent Dai Thomas, was introduced as a Colonel for the British Secret Service. She is a telepath and, judging by her own assertion, the most powerful in England. The "psychoblast" power she possessed in her British form in the "616" universe was manifested as a "psychic grenade" that she "detonated" in the minds of others. Agents Betsy Braddock and Dai Thomas, were assigned to aid Xavier in his search for his son, David (known in the mainstream Marvel universe as [[Proteus (comics)#Ultimate Proteus|Proteus]]), a powerful mutant who could physically possess the bodies of others and manipulate reality. During the investigation, however, Agent Thomas was killed and Betsy's body was possessed by David, who set about wreaking havoc and killing innocent humans while in her body. She eventually managed to resist his control, albeit briefly, and pleaded with Xavier to kill her. Xavier could not bring himself to do so, but Colossus dropped a car on her, killing both Betsy and David Xavier.

Betsy's consciousness survived, however, somehow moving into the comatose body of an Asian girl called Kwannon. Kwannon was glad to be able to move on to the afterlife, and willingly gave Betsy her body. This body switch was actually a blessing in disguise, as Betsy had breast cancer which was potentially fatal. She regarded her near-death experience as intensely fascinating. The change has also led her to bear a less formal look, as she was seen after her body-switch with a number of cosmetic piercings. She somehow retained her telepathic powers in Kwannon's body and even gained the new ability to create a blade that can cut through most materials, even a Sentinel. She was said to be aiding in the formation of [[S.T.R.I.K.E.#Ultimate S.T.R.I.K.E.|S.T.R.I.K.E.]], the British division of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.#Ultimate S.H.I.E.L.D.|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. Recently, though, she was revealed to have been working undercover for Charles Xavier as a spy investigating the activities of [[Fenris (comics)#Ultimate Fenris|Fenris]].

Betsy officially joined the X-Men as Psylocke in Ultimate X-Men #83. Her employment with S.T.R.I.K.E. had ended because the body she currently inhabits is that of a minor, making her too young to serve as a government agent. She was recruited by [[Bishop (comics)#Ultimate Bishop|Bishop]] into his new X-Men after angrily informing Cyclops that he had turned his back on the X-Men and the good they can achieve after he refused to help a group of mutants being attacked by [[Sentinel (comics)#Ultimate Sentinels|Sentinels]] solely because he thought it would make the Xavier Institute look bad. 
 
As in the mainstream Marvel Universe, Betsy is the twin sister of Brian Braddock, who is now a member of the European Defense Initiative (the [[European Union]]'s equivalent of [[The Ultimates]]), code named [[Captain Britain#Ultimate Captain Britain|Captain Britain]]. Her father, Professor Sir James Braddock, is still alive in the Ultimate universe, and oversees the EDI's super-soldier program. In Ultimate X-Men #86, Bishop referred to Psylocke as his wife, when the Fenris twins threatened to kill her. In issue 88, Psylocke confronts Bishop about his comments about their future marriage, and from what he says, it is implied that Psylocke was killed before Bishop travelled back in time.

==In other media==
===Television===
[[Image:Psylocke.jpg|225px|thumb|right|Psylocke on ''[[X-Men (TV series)]]'']]
*Psylocke appears during the fourth season of the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' animated series, in the [[Beyond Good and Evil (X-Men episode)|Beyond Good and Evil]] [[story arc]]. She was in episode 51 entitled "[[Beyond Good and Evil (X-Men episode)#Beyond Good and Evil Part 2: Promise of Apocalypse|Promise of Apocalypse]]", and in Episode 53, entitled "[[Beyond Good and Evil (X-Men episode)#Beyond Good and Evil Part 4: End and Beginning|End and Beginning]]". In this storyline, Psylocke appears to be a lone warrior who practices theft with a cause (a la [[Robin Hood]]). She comes into direct conflict with Archangel and, later on, Sabretooth and Mystique. She refers to her brother as fighting to help mutants, but does not name him as Captain Britain. This incarnation of Psylocke had the notable ability to use her psi-blades as projectiles, incapacitating opponents from a distance. She also makes two quick cameos: during Season 2 in Episode 18, "[[Repo Man (X-Men episode)|Repo Man]]", and Episode 24, "[[Mojovision]]".

===Film===
*In the film ''[[X2 (film)|X2: X-Men United]]'', her name appears on a list of names [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] scrolls through on Stryker's computer while looking for Magneto's file, and in the X2 [[novelization]], Psylocke made a cameo as one of the mutants affected by Dark [[Cerebro]]. In it, she is in [[Vatican City]] during a fashion show and is seen waking up from her coma <U+2014>induced by Dark Cerebro<U+2014> when the machine begins affecting humans. She uses her telepathy to sense what is going on.
[[Image:Psylocke-X-Men 3.jpg|frame|109px|right|[[Meiling Melan<U+00E7>on]] as Psylocke]]
*Psylocke appears in the [[feature film]] ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', played by actress [[Meiling Melan<U+00E7>on]]. In the film, she fights against the X-Men as a member of the Brotherhood. During an interview with ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine, Melan<U+00E7>on said that in ''X3'', Psylocke has the power to turn into shadows and create psi-blades.  However, in the film, she doesn't appear to create psi-blades (and the rumor that said the DVD would have a deleted scene in which Psylocke used her psi-blades was proven wrong), but she appears out of nowhere. There were, however, no shadows visible when she did so. In the film, Psylocke is killed alongside [[Arclight (comics)|Arclight]] and [[Quill (comics)|Quill]] by the Dark Phoenix's disintegration wave. The film's novelization makes no mention of what happens to Psylocke, Quill, and Arclight after their unsuccessful attempt to kill Angel's father. According to scriptwriter [[Zak Penn]], the character played by Melan<U+00E7>on was not named as Psylocke in the original script.  In a Q&A on thexverse.com, he claimed that: "There was some switching of character names later in production, and I'm not exactly sure how Psylocke got thrown into the mix."<ref>[http://www.thexverse.com/community/showpost.php?p=38406&postcount=89 www.thexverse.com]</ref>. On the DVD Commentary of the film it was stated by Brett Ratner that the character played by [[Meiling Melan<U+00E7>on]] is Psylocke.

===Video games===
