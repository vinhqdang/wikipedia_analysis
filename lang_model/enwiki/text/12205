'''''Pinguicula moranensis''''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|p|<U+026A>|<U+014B>|<U+02C8>|<U+0261>|w|<U+026A>|k|j|<U+028A>|l|<U+0259>|_|<U+02CC>|m|<U+0252>r|<U+0259>|<U+02C8>|n|<U+025B>|n|s|<U+0268>|s}}) is a perennial [[rosette (botany)|rosette]]-forming [[carnivorous plant|insectivorous]] [[herbaceous plant|herb]] native to [[Mexico]] and [[Guatemala]].<ref>Ruiz 2001, pg. 153; Casper (1966) included [[San Salvador]] in the range of the species. Those populations south and east of Guatemala, however, have since been assigned to ''P. mesophytica'' <small>Zamudio</small>.</ref>  A species of [[butterwort]], it forms summer [[Rosette (botany)|rosettes]] of flat, [[succulent]] leaves up to 10&nbsp;centimeters (4&nbsp;in) long, which are covered in [[mucilaginous]] (sticky) glands that attract, trap, and digest [[arthropod]] prey. Nutrients derived from the prey are used to supplement the nutrient-poor [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] that the plant grows in.  In the winter the plant forms a non-carnivorous rosette of small, fleshy leaves that conserves energy while food and moisture supplies are low.  Single pink, purple, or violet flowers appear twice a year on upright stalks up to 25 centimeters long. 

The species was first collected by [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]] and [[Aim<U+00E9> Bonpland|Bonpland]] on the outskirts of Mina de Mor<U+00E1>n in the [[Sierra de Pachuca]] of the modern-day Mexican state of [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]] on their [[Alexander von Humboldt#Latin American expedition|Latin American expedition]] of 1799<U+2013>1804.<ref name=Zamudio1999>Zamudio, S. 1999</ref> Based on these collections, Humboldt, Bonpland and [[Carl Sigismund Kunth]] described this species in ''Nova Genera et Species Plantarum'' in 1817. The extremely variable species has been redefined at least twice since,<ref name=Zamudio1999 /><ref name=Casper1966>Casper, S.J. 1966</ref><ref name=Ruiz2001>Ruiz, S.J. 2001</ref> while several new species have been segregated from it based on various geographical or [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] distinctions, although the legitimacy of some of these is still debated.<ref>As an example, see Speta 1989. Of the three species described by Speta & Fuchs, two (''P. rectifolia'' and ''P. potosiensis'') were rejected as synonyms by Zamudio 2001, while ''P. rectifolia'' was supported by Ciezlak et al.'s phylogenetic study in 2005.</ref>  ''P. moranensis'' remains the most common and most widely distributed member of the [[List of Pinguicula species#Section Orcheosanthus|Section ''Orcheosanthus'']].<ref name=Zamudio1999 /> It has long been cultivated for its carnivorous nature and attractive flowers, and is one of the most common [[butterwort]]s in cultivation.

The generic name ''Pinguicula'' is derived from the Latin ''pinguis'' (meaning "fat") due to the buttery texture of the surface of the carnivorous leaves. The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''moranensis'' refers to its type location, Mina de Moran.

==Plant characteristics==
[[Image:Pinguicula moranensis dimorphic.jpg|thumb|left|Summer rosette emerging from winter rosette]]

===Habit===
''P. moranensis'' is seasonally dimorphic, in that it undergoes two distinct growth habits throughout the year.  During the summer when rain and insect prey are most plentiful, the plant forms a ground hugging rosette composed of 6<U+2013>8 generally [[Leaf shape|obovate]] leaves, each up to 95&nbsp;millimeters (3<U+00BE>&nbsp;in) long.<ref name=Alcala2005>Alcal<U+00E1>, R.E. & Dominguez, C.A. 2005</ref> These leaves are carnivorous, having a large surface area densely covered with stalked mucilaginous glands with which they attract, trap, and digest arthropod prey, most commonly [[fly|flies]].  These so-called "summer leaves" are replaced by "winter rosettes" of small, glandless succulent leaves with the onset of the dry season in October.  This protective winter rosette allows the plant to undergo winter [[dormancy]] until the first rains begin in May.<ref name=Alcala2005 />  Flowers born singly on upright 10<U+2013>25&nbsp;centimeters (4<U+2013>10&nbsp;in.) [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncle]]s emerge twice during the year (from the summer rosette and again from the winter rosette), a feature rare among the Mexican species.<ref>Peduncle length: Ruiz 2001, pg. 158</ref><ref>According to Cieslak et al. 2005, ''P. moctezumae'', ''P. moranensis'', ''P. emarginata'', ''P. species'' <U+2018>Huahuapan<U+2019> and ''P. rectifolia'' all share this trait.</ref><ref name=Cieslak2005>Cieslak et al., 2005</ref> In the summer these appear in June, peak in August and September, and disappear with the return to the winter rosette in October or November.<ref name=Zamudio1999 />

===Leaves and carnivory===
[[Image:Pinguicula moranensis variation.jpg|thumb|right|350 px|Leaf color can be variable, even within a population. Oaxaca, Mexico]]
The leaf blades of the summer rosettes of ''P. moranensis'' are smooth, rigid, and succulent, varying from bright yellow-green to maroon in colour. The [[leaf|laminae]] are generally [[Leaf shape|obovate]] to [[Leaf shape|orbicular]], between 5.5 and 13&nbsp;centimeters (2<U+2013>5&nbsp;in.) long and supported by a 1 to 3.5&nbsp;centimetre (<U+215C><U+2013>1&nbsp;<U+215C>&nbsp;in.) [[petiole (botany)|petiole]].<ref name=Ruiz2001:158>Ruiz 2001, pg. 158</ref>  

As with all members of the genus, these leaf blades are densely covered by peduncular (stalked) [[mucilaginous]] [[gland]]s and [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]] (flat) digestive glands. The peduncular glands consist of a few secretory cells on top of a single-celled stalk. These cells produce a mucilaginous secretion which forms visible droplets across the leaf surface. This wet appearance probably helps lure prey in search of water; a similar phenomenon is observed in the [[sundew]]s. The droplets secrete only limited enzymes and serve mainly to entrap insects. On contact with an insect, the peduncular glands release additional mucilage from special reservoir cells located at the base of their stalks. The insect struggles, triggering more glands and encasing itself in mucilage. ''P. moranensis'' can bend its leaf edges slightly by [[thigmotropism]], bringing additional glands into contact with the trapped insect. The sessile glands, which lie flat on the leaf surface, serve to digest the insect prey. Once the prey is entrapped by the peduncular glands and digestion begins, the initial flow of nitrogen triggers enzyme release by the sessile glands. These [[enzyme]]s, which include [[amylase]], [[esterase]], [[phosphatase]], [[protease]], and [[ribonuclease]] break down the digestible components of the insect body. These fluids are then absorbed back into the leaf surface through [[Plant cuticle|cuticular]] holes, leaving only the [[chitin]] [[exoskeleton]] of the larger insects on the leaf surface.<ref name=legendre2002>Legendre, L. 2000</ref>

The holes in the [[Plant cuticle|cuticle]] which allow for this digestive mechanism pose a challenge for the plant, since they serve as breaks in the cuticle (waxy layer) that protects the plant from desiccation.<ref name=legendre2002 /> As a result, ''P. moranensis'' is usually found in relatively humid environments. The production of the stalked capture glands and sessile digestive glands is also costly. A recent study found that the density of these respective glands can be correlated to environmental gradients. For example, capture gland density was found to be highest where prey availability was low, whereas digestive glands density showed direct correlation to prey availability.<ref name=Alcala2005 /> These results suggest that the amount of investment in carnivorous features is an adaptation to the environmental gradients.

====Winter rosette====
[[Image:Pinguicula moranensis.jpeg|thumb|right|An inflorescence emerging from a winter rosette]]
The "winter" or "[[aestivation|resting]]" rosette of ''P. moranensis'' is two to three (maximum five) centimeters (<U+00BE><U+2013>2&nbsp;in.) in diameter and consists of 60 to 100 or more small, fleshy, non-glandular leaves.  These are each 10 to 30 millimeters (<U+215C><U+2013>1&nbsp;<U+00BC>&nbsp;in.) long and three to eight millimeters (<U+215B><U+2013>{{Fraction|5|16}}&nbsp;in.) wide, generally [[spatulate]] or oblong-spatulate, and densely covered with fine [[trichome|hairs]]. The rosette is either open or compact and bulb-like, depending on [[variety (botany)|variety]] (see [[Pinguicula moranensis#Varieties|below]]).<ref>Ruiz 2001, pg. 161</ref>

===Flowers===
''P. moranensis'' produces one to eight [[flower]]s during each flowering period.  These are borne singly on upright flower stalks which are green to brown-green in color and usually, like the upper surface of the carnivorous leaves, are densely covered in glandular hairs; the peduncles do, in fact, trap insect prey. The peduncles are 10 to 25&nbsp;centimeters (4<U+2013>10&nbsp;in.) long and taper from two to three millimeters (<U+215B>&nbsp;in.) at the base to one millimeter ({{Fraction|1|16}}&nbsp;in.) at the top.<ref name=Ruiz2001:158 />
[[Image:Pinguicula moranensis flower profile.jpg|thumb|left|''P. moranensis'' flower profile]]

The flowers themselves are composed of five [[petal]]s which are fused at one end. The throat, the portion of the flower near the attachment point which holds the reproductive organs, is funnel shaped, and the petals flare out from there into a five-lobed [[zygomorphic]] [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]]. The flowers 30 to 50 millimeters (1&nbsp;<U+00BC><U+2013>2&nbsp;in.) long.  Below the attachment point to the stem the petals are fused into a 15<U+2013>30&nbsp;millimeter long spur which protrudes backwards roughly perpendicular to the rest of the flower.<ref name=Ruiz2001:158 /><ref>According to Cieslak (2005), the spur length is a diagnostic feature when differentiating this species from ''P. recitoflia''. Cieslak asserts that in ''P. moranensis'' the spur is more than 50% longer than the rest of the corolla.</ref>

The ovary and attached [[pistil]] protrude from the top of the floral tube near its opening, with the receptive stigma surface toward the front. Two 1 millimeter [[anther]]s hang from recurved, 2 millimeter filaments behind the pistil.<ref name=Ruiz2001:159 /> Pollinators exiting after collecting nectar from the spur brush against the anther, transferring pollen to the stigma of the next flower they visit. The flowers can last up to 10 days but will wilt once they are pollinated.<ref>Legendre, L. ''[http://www.pinguicula.org/A_world_of_Pinguicula_2/Pages/Pollenisation_Pinguicula.htm Pollination of Pinguicula flowers]''. Retrieved on January 2, 2007.</ref> Pollinated ovaries ripen into 5&nbsp;millimeter ({{Fraction|3|16}}&nbsp;in.) dehiscent seed capsules containing numerous 1&nbsp;millimeter long seeds.<ref name=Ruiz2001:159 /> The chromosome count for this species is 2n=44.<ref>Ruiz 2001, pg. 60</ref>
[[Image:Pinguicula moranensis flower.jpg|thumb|right|Flower form from [[Quer<U+00E9>taro]], Mexico]]

The color and morphology of the flowers of this species is extremely variable, a source of delight to the [[horticulture|horticulturist]] and headache to the [[taxonomy|taxonomist]]. Some generalizations, however, can be made.

The corolla flares open into five lobes, two upper lobes and three lower lobes. The upper lobes are 7<U+2013>16&nbsp;millimeters (<U+00BC><U+2013><U+215C>&nbsp;in.) long by 4<U+2013>9&nbsp;millimeters ({{Fraction|5|32}}<U+2013><U+215C>&nbsp;in.) wide and generally oblong, obovate, or cuneate. The lower lobes are similarly shaped and are 7<U+2013>20&nbsp;millimeters (<U+00BC><U+2013><U+00BE>&nbsp;in.) long by 4<U+2013>18&nbsp;millimeters ({{Fraction|5|32}}<U+2013><U+00BE>&nbsp;in.) wide. The central lower lobe is usually slightly longer than its neighbors. All of the petal lobes have rounded ends. The floral tube that houses the reproductive organs and is visible at the base of corolla lobes is white or lilac in color and 4<U+2013>6&nbsp;millimeters ({{Fraction|5|32}}<U+2013><U+00BC>&nbsp;in.) long. The white color of the floral tube can extend to a variable distance onto the corolla lobes, particularly in a stripe on the lower middle lobe.<ref name=Ruiz2001:158 /> The color of the corolla lobes generally varies from pink to purple, but has been described by collectors as being "purple, scarlet, rosy-lavender to bluish-purple, dark pink to lavender, pinkish-purple, deep violet-purple, dark purple, bright mauve-pink, bright purple-pink, magenta with [white eye], [and] reddish pale with white eye."<ref name=Ruiz2001:184>Ruiz 2001, pg. 184</ref> A rare white-flowered form is also known.<ref name=Ruiz2001:184 />
[[Image:Pinguicula moranensis flower comparison.jpg|thumb|center|550px|Flower color and morphology can vary greatly even within a population, an unusual feature in the species. Notice the variation in the size and shape of the white and dark markings, as well as the various petal shapes and sizes present. Oaxaca, Mexico.]]

==Taxonomy==
Sergio Zamudio Ruiz, in his 2001 revision of the section ''Orcheosanthus'', called the identity and exact delimitation of ''P. moranensis'' "perhaps the most difficult problem to solve within the genus".<ref>Ruiz 2001, pg. 26; "La identidad de ''Pinguicula moranensis'' y su delimitaci<U+00F3>n precisa es quiz<U+00E1>s el problema m<U+00E1>s dif<U+00CD>cil de resolver dentro del g<U+00E9>nero."</ref> This difficulty is due mainly to the high variability and large geographic distribution of the species, which has given rise to the description of many synonyms since the species was first described nearly 200 years ago. Botanists have attempted to delimitate the species through various morphological, ecological and genetic methods, though to this date some debate remains as to the placement and description of ''P. moranensis'' and its relationship to the species to which it is closely related.

===Botanical history===
[[Image:Alexandre humboldt.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Alexander von Humboldt]]
Prior to [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Aim<U+00E9> Bonpland]]'s [[Alexander von Humboldt#Latin American expedition|Latin American expedition]] in 1799<U+2013>1804, only 8 ''Pinguicula'' species were known to science <U+2014> 5 from Europe, 2 from North America and ''[[Pinguicula involuta|P. involuta]]'' from [[Peru]]. From 1803<U+2013>1805, three additional species from Europe and North America were described, bringing the total of known species to 11.<ref name=Schlauer />  In 1817 [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]], [[Aim<U+00E9> Bonpland|Bonpland]] and [[Carl Sigismund Kunth]] described 3 new species from their Latin American expedition: The Peruvian ''[[Pinguicula calyptrata|P. calyptrata]]'' and the first known Mexican species: ''P. macrophylla'' and ''P. moranensis''.<ref>From Ruiz, S.J. 2001, orig. Humboldt, A., A. Bonpland & C.S. Kunth. 1817</ref>   At this point no infrageneric classification had yet been suggested.

In 1844 a French-Swiss botanist by the name of [[Alphonse Pyrame de Candolle]] (who created the first Code of Botanical Nomenclature) proposed a division of the genus into three [[Section (botany)|sections]] based on floral [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]. He placed in the section ''Orcheosanthus'' those species with purple, deeply bilabiate [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]]s with 5 sub-equal lobes, a short floral tube, and a large spur not protruding past this tube. He included four species in this section, all of them from Mexico: ''[[Pinguicula oblongiloba|P. oblongiloba]]'', ''[[Pinguicula orchidioides|P. orchidioides]]'', '''''P. caudata''''' and ''P. moranensis''.  He excluded ''P. macrophylla'' <small>H.B.K.</small> on the grounds that it was a "dubious species".<ref>From Ruiz, S.J. 2001, orig. Candolle, A.P. De. 1844</ref>

[[Image:Pinguicula caudata print.jpg|thumb|right|A print of ''P. caudata'' from Morren's work (1872)]]
The section ''Orcheosanthus'' grew as [[Charles Jacques <U+00C9>douard Morren|Charles Morren]] described '''''P. flos-mulionis''''' in 1872, [[Eugene Fournier]] added '''''P. sodalium''''' in 1873 and Sander proposed '''''P. bakeriana''''' in 1881.<ref name=Schlauer />  In 1879<U+2013>1888, however, botanist [[William Hemsley (botanist)|William Hemsley]], after studying multiple specimens in herbariums and in culture, came to the conclusion that all the taxa placed in the section ''Orcheosanthus'' up to that point belonged to the same single species. Due to doubts as to the identity of the original two species described by [[Alexander von Humboldt|H.]][[Aim<U+00E9> Bonpland|B.]][[Carl Sigismund Kunth|K.]], Hemsley decided to use the name ''P. caudata'' <small>Schltdl.</small> for his conglomerate species. This name has been "indiscriminately" applied to members of the complex ever since.<ref>Ruiz 2001, pg. 26</ref>

====Twentieth century====
When Barnhart revised the family [[Lentibulariaceae]] in 1916, he recognized six species in the section ''Orcheosanthus'', admitting however that this number was likely to change as others studied the section in the future. Sprague in 1928 proposed that the species joined by Hemsley were probably distinct, but that they were likely so interrelated that distinguishing between them would require observing characteristics that were usually or always indistinct in dried specimens.<ref>The difficulty of basing taxonomical work in the genus ''Pinguicula'' solely on dried specimens has been noted by several frustrated botanists. McVaugh & Mickel in their 1963 notes on the section ''Orcheosanthus'' noted that "Herbarium study of these plants is difficult and frustrating because the leaves and other vegetative and reproductive structures are so fragile that dried specimens are seldom adequately preserved. Usually but a single flower is found on a plant, and the extraordinarily fragile pressed flowers often lose their original color and shape to a very large extent. Often neither vegetative nor reproductive structures can be studied without severe damage to the specimen" (McVaugh, 1963).  Barnhart (1916) had stated that "the range of variation is enormous, but how much is seasonal, how much individual, and how much of taxonomic importance, is (based on herbarium samples alone) at present mere guesswork" (Barnhart, 1916).  This conclusion was echoed by Sprague (1928), Ernst (1961), and McVaugh (1963).</ref> Sprague recognized eight species in the section: ''P. moranensis'' <small>H.B.K</small>, ''P. caudata'' <small>Schltdl.</small>, ''P. oblongiloba'', ''P. flos-mulionis'', ''P. bakeriana'', a ''P. moranensis''-like '''''P. rosei''''' described by Watson in 1911, and the very distinct ''[[Pinguicula gypsicola|P. gypsicola]]''.<ref name=Ruiz2001 />

In 1966 [[Siegfried Jost Casper|Casper]] published the first ever monograph of the genus. He clearly defined his taxonomic organization according to a broad range of morphological and phenotypic characteristics. Casper considered ''P. caudata'', as well as various other taxa, to be synonyms of ''P. moranensis''. He therefore recognized only 6 species for the section ''Orcheosanthus'': ''P. moranensis'', ''P. gypsicola'', ''P. macrophylla'' <small>H.B.K.</small>, ''P. oblongiloba'', and the two recently discovered species ''[[Pinguicula colimensis|P. colimensis]]'' and ''[[Pinguicula cyclosecta|P. cyclosecta]]''.<ref name=Casper1966 />  Since that time 14 additional species have been discovered and assigned to the section.<ref>Ruiz 2001, pg. 29</ref>  When Zamudio redefined the section in 1999, however, he chose to include only 12 species, including all six of Casper's choices.<ref name=Ruiz2001 />  ''P. moranensis'', therefore, remains in the section ''Orcheosanthus'', along with over a dozen synonyms it has inherited in its 200-year taxonomic history.

===Phylogenetics===
[[Image:Pinguicula moranensis flowering.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Phylogenetic studies take into account a broad range of plant characteristics, such as flowering time and morphology]]
The varying importance which different authors have placed on various morphological characteristics when determining the taxonomy of the genus has long made the resulting subdivision of the genus a subject of controversy.<ref name=Cieslak2005 /> Ruiz (2001) supported his revision of the section ''Orcheosanthus'' with a [[phylogenetic]] analysis, using 20 morphological and phenological characteristics.<ref name=Ruiz2001 /> In 2005, Cieslak et al. conducted the first comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the entire [[genus]] ''Pinguicula''.  Using molecular data, they were able to isolate those morphological characteristics that were [[synapomorphy|synapomorphies]] for various groups, providing evidence for a genetically based taxonomic structure. Their overall results did not support the placement of ''P. moranensis'' in the section ''Orcheosanthus'', rather indicating that it should be placed in the section ''Longitubus'' along with ''P. laueana''.<ref name=Cieslak2005 />

In further disagreement with Ruiz's 2001 revision of the section ''Orcheosanthus'', Cieslak et al.'s phylogenetic data indicated that ''P. rectifolia'' and several unnamed taxa that had been treated as synonyms of ''P. moranensis'' are in fact a distinct complex.  They isolated several morphological characteristics that could be used to differentiate between the complexes, including floral spur length (longer in ''P. moranensis''), flower color (never with a blue tinge in ''P. moranensis''), and the shape of the lateral corolla lobe (exhibiting a twist in ''P. rectifolia'').<ref name=Cieslak2005 /> A more thorough study analyzing numerous ''P. moranensis'' populations and other members of closely related taxa is needed to resolve this complex.

===Varieties===
After extensively studying ''P. moranensis'' in habitat, Ruiz (1999) came to the conclusion that the species could be divided into two distinct [[Variety (biology)|varieties]], mainly on the basis of the shape of the leaves composing their winter (resting) rosettes:<ref name=Zamudio1999 />

*'''''Pinguicula moranensis''''' <small>Kunth in [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humb.]], [[Aim<U+00E9> Bonpland|Bonpl.]] et Kunth.</small> var. '''''moranensis'''''
This variety has open winter rosettes composed of leaves which are spatulate in shape and have an obtuse or rounded end. It tends to grow in limestone-based substrates.
*'''''Pinguicula moranensis''''' <small>Kunth in [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humb.]], [[Aim<U+00E9> Bonpland|Bonpl.]] et Kunth.</small> var. '''''neovolcanica'''''
This variety has a closed, bulb-like rosette of winter leaves which are acicular (pointy) at the tip. It tends to grow on igneous substrates.

Ruiz also noted that these subspecies differed in their preference of soil substrate. He first noted this while attempting to find the population of plants from which [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]] and [[Aim<U+00E9> Bonpland|Bonpland]] had collected their type specimens in 1803. Although Ruiz was able to find many populations of the species growing in the areas that Humboldt and Bonpland had visited in the vicinity if Mina de Moran, only one population, the only one growing on limestone, matched H.B.K.'s description and their type and isotype specimens now housed in the [[herbarium]] of the [[Mus<U+00E9>um national d'histoire naturelle|French national museum of natural history]]. The other populations in the area grew on substrate of igneous origin and more closely matched [[William Jackson Hooker|Hooker's]] 1846 description of ''P. orchidioides''.<ref>Ruiz 2001, pg. 177;  The modern day ''[[Pinguicula orchidioides|P. orchidioides]]'' was described two years earlier (in 1844) by [[Alphonse Pyrame de Candolle|A. De Candolle]]. Hooker described a plant he saw growing at Kew Botanical Gardens and, thinking it to be similar to Candolle's ''P. orchidioides'', applied that name.</ref> These latter plants then became the new variety, ''P. moranensis'' ssp. ''neovolcanica''.<ref name=Zamudio1999 />

==Distribution and habitat==
[[Image:Pinguicula moranensis distribution.svg|thumb|left|300px|Distribution of ''P. moranensis'' in Mexico and Guatemala]]
''P. moranensis'' is the most widely distributed member of the [[List of Pinguicula species#Section Orcheosanthus|Section ''Orcheosanthus'']].<ref name=Zamudio1999 /> It is also the most common and widely distributed ''Pinguicula'' species in Mexico, being found in all the major mountain ranges except Sierra Madre Occidental and Baja California.<ref name=Ruiz2001:159>Ruiz 2001, pg. 159</ref> Locations are known from the Mexican states of [[Tamaulipas]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Nuevo Le<U+00F3>n]],  [[Campeche]], [[Chiapas]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Puebla]], [[Mexican Federal District|Distrito Federal]], [[Veracruz]], [[State of Mexico|M<U+00E9>xico]], [[Quer<U+00E9>taro]], [[San Luis Potos<U+00ED>]], [[Morelos]], [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], [[Guerrero]], [[Zacatecas]], [[Tlaxcala]], [[Quintana Roo]], and [[Michoac<U+00E1>n]] and the [[Guatemala]]n [[Departments of Guatemala|departments]] of [[Huehuetenango]], [[Quich<U+00E9> Department|Quich<U+00E9>]], [[San Marcos, Guatemala|San Marcos]], [[Quetzaltenango]], [[Totonicap<U+00E1>n]], [[Solol<U+00E1>]], [[Chimaltenango]], [[Baja Verapaz Department|Baja Verapaz]], [[Guatemala Department|Guatemala]] and [[El Progreso Department|El Progreso]].<ref name=Ruiz2001 /> Here it grows in mountainous regions between 800 and 3200&nbsp;meters (2600<U+2013>10500&nbsp;ft) in altitude. Generally, the species tends to follow [[sedimentary]] outcrops of the [[Cretaceous]] period.  ''P. moranensis'' var. ''neovolcanica'', however, tends to grow on [[igneous]] rocks of the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]].<ref name=Ruiz2001:159 />[[Image:Pinguicula moranensis tree.png|thumb|180px|''P. moranensis'' growing on a tree trunk in [[Tamaulipas]]]]

''P. moranensis'' most often grows in oak, [[Madrean pine-oak woodlands|pine-oak]], or temperate montane woodlands. However, its distribution penetrates into tropical forests and [[xerophyte|xerophytic]] shrublands, as well as in gorges and canyon walls with high environmental [[humidity]]. ''P. moranensis'' prefers humid and shady environments, such as slopes by streams, gullies, or road cuts, or among leaf litter in sandy soil high in organic matter. Its ability to gather nutrients from the arthropod prey it catches allows it to grow in low-nutrient environments where other plants would usually out-compete it. As a result, it is often found in disturbed areas or on steep cliffs or hillsides.  Since its roots do little more than provide anchorage, the plant requires little or no soil, and dense clusters can be found clinging onto boulders, moss or crags in rock faces, or even [[epiphyte|epiphytically]] on tree trunks. Common companion plants include [[moss]]es, ''[[Selaginella]]'', [[fern]]s and other herbaceous plants, as well as canopy trees such as [[pine]]s and [[oak]]s.<ref name=Ruiz2001:159 />

==Cultivation==
''P. moranensis'' is one of the most popular and commonly cultivated ''Pinguicula'',<ref name=DAmato1998>D'Amato P. 1998, pg. 203<U+2013>205</ref> in part due to its large size, large and pretty flowers, and the ease with which it can be grown as a container plant. Most growers use an open soil mix composed of some combination of washed [[sand]], [[perlite]], [[vermiculite]], [[peat moss]], [[gypsum]] and/or decomposed granite. Soil should be kept well drained, but watered regularly with [[distilled water]] in the summer and only very rarely once the plant enters its winter rosette. The species grows readily on well-lit windowsills, under fluorescent lights, or in warm to hot greenhouses.<ref name=DAmato1998 />

===Hybrids and cultivars===
Although no natural hybrids involving ''P. moranensis'' have been reported, the species is known to hybridize quite readily in cultivation.  As a result, a number of [[cultivar]]s involving the species have been registered and are recognized by the [[International Carnivorous Plant Society]]:<ref>International Carnivorous Plant Society, ''[http://carnivorousplants.org/cultivars/pincult.html Registered Cultivar Names <U+2014> Pinguicula]''.
