The '''durian''' ({{pron-en|<U+02C8>dj<U+028A>ri<U+0259>n}})<ref>Pronunciation common to {{cite book | title = Oxford English Dictionary | publisher = Oxford University Press | edition = 2 }} and {{cite web | title = Random House Dictionary | publisher = dictionary.com | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/durian?r=75 | date = 2008-10-09 }}</ref> is the [[fruit]] of several [[tree]] [[species]] belonging to the [[genus]] ''Durio'' and the [[Malvaceae]] [[Family (biology)|family]]<ref name="GRIN"/><ref name=APW>{{cite web | url = http://www.mobot.org/mobot/research/APweb/orders/malvalesweb.htm#Malvales | title = Angiosperm Phylogeny Website&nbsp;<U+2014> Malvales | publisher = [[Missouri Botanical Garden]]}}</ref> (although some taxonomists place ''Durio'' in a distinct family, Durionaceae<ref name="GRIN"/>). Widely known and revered in [[southeast Asia]] as the "king of fruits", the durian is distinctive for its large size, unique [[odor|odour]], and formidable [[Spine (botany)|thorn]]-covered [[husk]]. The fruit can grow as large as {{convert|30|cm|in}} long and {{convert|15|cm|in|0}} in diameter, and it typically weighs one to three&nbsp;kilograms (2 to 7&nbsp;lb). Its shape ranges from oblong to round, the colour of its husk green to brown, and its flesh pale yellow to red, depending on the species.

The edible flesh emits a distinctive odour, strong and penetrating even when the husk is intact. Some people regard the durian as fragrant; others find the aroma overpowering and offensive. The smell evokes reactions from deep appreciation to intense disgust, and has been described variously as [[almond]]s, rotten onions, [[turpentine]] and gym socks. The odour has led to the fruit's banishment from certain hotels and public transportation in southeast Asia.

The durian, native to [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]],<!--Please do not include the Philippines; according to Michael J. Brown there is some debate as to whether the durian is native to the country, or was introduced, meaning the claim is inconclusive.--> has been known to the Western world for about 600&nbsp;years. The 19th-century British [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] famously described its flesh as "a rich custard highly flavoured with almonds". The flesh can be consumed at various stages of ripeness, and it is used to flavour a wide variety of savoury and sweet edibles in Southeast Asian cuisines. The seeds can also be eaten when cooked.

There are 30 recognised ''Durio'' species, at least nine of which produce edible fruit. ''Durio zibethinus'' is the only species available in the international market: other species are sold in their local regions. There are hundreds of durian [[cultivar]]s; many consumers express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher prices in the market.

Durian [[tree]]s are large, growing to 25<U+2013>50&nbsp;metres (80<U+2013>164&nbsp;ft) in height depending on the species.<ref name=Brown/> The leaves are [[evergreen]], elliptic to oblong and 10<U+2013>18&nbsp;centimetres (4<U+2013>7&nbsp;in) long. The flowers are produced in three to thirty clusters together on large branches and directly on the trunk with each flower having a calyx ([[sepals]]) and five (rarely four or six) [[petal]]s. Durian trees have one or two flowering and fruiting periods per year, though the timing varies depending on the species, cultivars, and localities.

===Cultivars===
[[Image:D101 and random stock.jpg|thumb|right|Different cultivars of durian often have distinct colours. D101 (right) has rich yellow flesh, clearly distinguishable from another variety (left).]]

Over the centuries, numerous durian [[cultivar]]s propagated by vegetative [[Cloning|clone]]s have arisen in southeast Asia. They used to be grown with mixed results from seeds of trees bearing superior quality fruit, but are now propagated by [[layering]], [[marcotting]], or more commonly, by [[grafting]], including bud, veneer, wedge, whip or U-grafting onto seedlings of randomly selected [[rootstock]]s. Different cultivars can be distinguished to some extent by variations in the fruit shape, such as the shape of the spines.<ref name=Brown/> Durian consumers express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher prices in the market.<ref name=ST/>

Most cultivars have a common name and a code number starting with "D". For example, some popular clones are Kop (D99 {{lang-th|<U+0E01><U+0E1A>&nbsp;<U+2014> "frog"}} {{IPA-th|k<U+00F2>p|}}), Chanee (D123, {{lang-th|<U+0E0A><U+0E30><U+0E19><U+0E35>&nbsp;<U+2014> gibbon}} {{IPA-th|t<U+0255><U+02B0><U+00E1>ni<U+02D0>|}}), Berserah or Green Durian or Tuan Mek Hijau (D145 {{lang-th|<U+0E17><U+0E38><U+0E40><U+0E23><U+0E35><U+0E22><U+0E19><U+0E40><U+0E02><U+0E35><U+0E22><U+0E27>&nbsp;<U+2014> Green Durian}} {{IPA-th|t<U+02B0><U+00FA>ri<U+02D0><U+0259>n k<U+02B0><U+01D0>ow|}}), Kan Yao (D158, {{lang-th|<U+0E01><U+0E49><U+0E32><U+0E19><U+0E22><U+0E32><U+0E27>&nbsp;<U+2014> Long Stem}} {{IPA-th|k<U+00E2><U+02D0>n ja<U+02D0>w|}}), Mon Thong (D159, {{lang-th|<U+0E2B><U+0E21><U+0E2D><U+0E19><U+0E17><U+0E2D><U+0E07>&nbsp;<U+2014> Golden Pillow}} {{IPA-th|m<U+0254><U+030C><U+02D0>n t<U+02B0><U+0254><U+02D0><U+014B>|}}), Kradum Thong ({{lang-th|<U+0E01><U+0E23><U+0E30><U+0E14><U+0E38><U+0E21><U+0E17><U+0E2D><U+0E07>&nbsp;<U+2014> Golden Button}} {{IPA-th|kr<U+00E0>dum t<U+02B0><U+0254><U+02D0><U+014B>|}}), and with no common name, D24 and D169. Each cultivar has a distinct taste and odour. More than 200 cultivars of ''D. zibethinus'' exist in [[Thailand]]. Mon thong is the most commercially sought after for its thick, full-bodied creamy and mild sweet tasting flesh with relatively moderate smell emitted and smaller seeds while Chanee is the best in terms of its resistance to infection by ''[[Phytophthora palmivora]]''.

The durian is a seasonal fruit, unlike some other non-seasonal tropical fruits such as the [[papaya]], which are available throughout the year. In Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore, the season for durians is typically from June to August, which coincides with that of the [[mangosteen]].<ref name=Brown/> Prices of durians are relatively high as compared with other fruits. For example, in Singapore, the strong demand for high quality cultivars such as the D24, ''Sultan'', and ''Mao Shan Wang'' has resulted in typical retail prices of between [[S$]]8 to S$15 ([[US$]]5 to US$10) per kilogram of whole fruit.<ref name=ST>{{cite web | url = http://www.stomp.com.sg/stfoodiesclub/taste/03/index.html | title = ST Foodies Club&nbsp;<U+2014> Durian King | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2007-07-25 | publisher = [[The Straits Times]] | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071215124752/http://www.stomp.com.sg/stfoodiesclub/taste/03/index.html | archivedate = 2007-12-15 }}</ref> With an average weight of about {{convert|1.5|kg}}, a durian fruit would therefore cost about S$12 to S$22 (US$8 to US$15).<ref name=ST/> The edible portion of the fruit, known as the [[aril]] and usually referred to as the "flesh" or "pulp", only accounts for about 15-30% of the mass of the entire fruit.<ref name=Brown>{{cite book | author=Brown, Michael J. | title=Durio&nbsp;<U+2014> A Bibliographic Review | publisher=International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI), at p35 | year=1997 | url = http://www.bioversityinternational.org/fileadmin/bioversity/publications/pdfs/654.pdf | format = PDF | isbn=92-9043-318-3 | accessdate = 2011-06-12}}</ref> Many consumers in Singapore are nevertheless quite willing to spend up to around S$75 (US$50) in a single purchase of about half a dozen of the favoured fruit to be shared by family members.<ref name=ST/>

==Flavour and odour==
[[Image:Singapore MRT Fines.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Sign forbidding durians on Singapore's [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Mass Rapid Transit]]]]

The unusual flavour and odour of the fruit have prompted many people to express diverse and passionate views ranging from deep appreciation to intense disgust. Writing in 1856, the British [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] provides a much-quoted description of the flavour of the durian:

{{cquote|The five cells are silky-white within, and are filled with a mass of firm, cream-coloured pulp, containing about three seeds each. This pulp is the edible part, and its consistence and flavour are indescribable. A rich custard highly flavoured with almonds gives the best general idea of it, but there are occasional wafts of flavour that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine, and other incongruous dishes. Then there is a rich glutinous smoothness in the pulp which nothing else possesses, but which adds to its delicacy. It is neither acid nor sweet nor juicy; yet it wants neither of these qualities, for it is in itself perfect. It produces no nausea or other bad effect, and the more you eat of it the less you feel inclined to stop. In fact, to eat Durians is a new sensation worth a voyage to the East to experience. ... as producing a food of the most exquisite flavour it is unsurpassed.<ref name=Wallace>{{cite web | author = Wallace, Alfred Russel | title = On the Bamboo and Durian of Borneo | year = 1856 | url = http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S027.htm | accessdate = 2008-11-20 | authorlink = Alfred Russel Wallace}}</ref>{{Ref_label|a|a|none}}}}

The natives give it honourable titles, exalt it, and make verses on it".<ref name=Wallace1886p74/>

While Wallace cautions that "the smell of the ripe fruit is certainly at first disagreeable", later descriptions by westerners are more graphic.

Durians from different species or clones can have significantly different aromas; for example, red durian (''D. dulcis'') has a deep [[caramel]] flavour with a [[turpentine]] odour while red-fleshed durian (''D. graveolens'') emits a fragrance of roasted [[almond]]s.<ref name=ACIAR2>{{cite web | url = http://www.cababstractsplus.org/google/abstract.asp?AcNo=20053008326| title = Occurrence, Distribution and Utilisation of Durian Germplasm | year = 2004 | accessdate = 2008-11-20 | format = PDF |author = O'Gara, E., Guest, D.

This strong odour can be detected half a mile away by animals, thus luring them. In addition, the fruit is extremely appetising to a variety of animals, including [[squirrel]]s, [[Chevrotain|mouse deer]], [[pig]]s, [[orangutan]], [[elephant]]s, and even carnivorous [[tiger]]s. While some of these animals eat the fruit and dispose of the seed under the parent plant, others swallow the seed with the fruit and then transport it some distance before excreting, with the seed being dispersed as a result.<ref>{{cite book | author=Marinelli, Janet (Ed.) | title=Brooklyn Botanic Garden Gardener's Desk Reference | publisher=Henry Holt and Co. | year=1998 | isbn = 0-8050-5095-7 | page = 691 }}</ref> The thorny, armoured covering of the fruit discourages smaller animals; larger animals are more likely to transport the seeds far from the parent tree.<ref name=McGee>{{cite book | author = McGee, Harold | title= On Food and Cooking (Revised Edition) | publisher=Scribner | year=2004 | isbn = 0-684-80001-2 | page = 379 | authorlink = Harold McGee}}</ref>

===Ripeness and selection===
[[Image:Durian customer.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A customer in Malaysia sniffs durian before purchasing it.]]

According to ''[[Larousse Gastronomique]]'', the durian fruit is ready to eat when its husk begins to crack.<ref>{{cite book | title = [[Larousse Gastronomique]] | author = Montagne, Prosper (Ed.) | publisher = Clarkson Potter | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-609-60971-8 | page = 439}}</ref> However, the ideal stage of ripeness to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast Asia and by species. Some species grow so tall that they can only be collected once they have fallen to the ground, whereas most cultivars of ''D. zibethinus'' are nearly always cut from the tree and allowed to ripen while waiting to be sold. Some people in [[southern Thailand]] prefer their durians relatively young when the clusters of fruit within the shell are still crisp in texture and mild in flavour. For some people in [[northern Thailand]], the preference is for the fruit to be soft and aromatic. In Malaysia and Singapore, most consumers prefer the fruit to be as ripe and pungent in aroma as possible and may even risk allowing the fruit to continue ripening after its husk has already cracked open. In this state, the flesh becomes richly creamy, slightly alcoholic,<ref name=Davidson/> the aroma pronounced and the flavour highly complex.

The various preferences regarding ripeness among consumers make it hard to issue general statements about choosing a "good" durian. A durian that falls off the tree continues to ripen for two to four days, but after five or six days most would consider it overripe and unpalatable.<ref name=Morton>{{cite book | author=Morton, J. F. | url = http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/durian_ars.html | title=Fruits of Warm Climates | publisher=Florida Flair Books | year=1987 | isbn = 0-9610184-1-0}}</ref> The usual advice for a durian consumer choosing a whole fruit in the market is to examine the quality of the [[plant stem|stem]] or stalk which loses moisture as it ages: a big, solid stem is a sign of freshness.<ref name=tech>{{cite web | url = http://www.proscitech.com.au/trop/d.htm | title = Durian & Mangosteens | publisher = Prositech.com | accessdate = 2008-11-20 }}</ref> Reportedly, unscrupulous merchants wrap, paint, or remove the stalks altogether. Another frequent piece of advice is to shake the fruit and listen for the sound of the seeds moving within, indicating the durian is very ripe and the pulp has dried out a bit.<ref name=tech/>

The durian has been known and consumed in southeastern Asia since [[Prehistory|prehistoric times]], but has only been known to the western world for about 600 years. The earliest known European reference to the durian is the record of [[Niccol<U+00F2> Da Conti]], who travelled to southeastern Asia in the 15th century.<ref>{{cite book |author=Brown, Michael J. |title=Durio&nbsp;<U+2014> A Bibliographic Review |publisher=International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) |year=1997 |url= http://www.bioversityinternational.org/fileadmin/bioversity/publications/pdfs/654.pdf |isbn=92-9043-318-3 |page=3 |format = PDF |accessdate = 2011-06-12}}</ref> The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] physician [[Garcia de Orta]] described durians in ''[[Col<U+00F3>quios dos simples e drogas da India]]'' published in 1563. In 1741, ''Herbarium Amboinense'' by the German botanist [[Georg Eberhard Rumphius]] was published, providing the most detailed and accurate account of durians for over a century. The genus ''Durio'' has a complex [[taxonomy]] that has seen the subtraction and addition of many species since it was created by Rumphius.<ref name=ACIAR/> During the early stages of its taxonomical study, there was some confusion between durian and the [[soursop]] (''Annona muricata''), for both of these species had thorny green fruit.<ref name=Brown_006/> It is also interesting to note the Malay name for the soursop is ''durian Belanda'', meaning ''Dutch durian''.<ref>{{cite book | author=Davidson, Alan | title=The Oxford Companion to Food | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1999 | isbn = 0-19-211579-0 | page= 737}}</ref> In the 18th century, [[Johann Anton Weinmann]] considered the durian to belong to [[Chestnut|Castaneae]] as its fruit was similar to the horse chestnut.<ref name=Brown_006>{{cite book |author=Brown, Michael J. |title=Durio&nbsp;<U+2014> A Bibliographic Review |publisher=International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) |year=1997 |url= http://www.bioversityinternational.org/fileadmin/bioversity/publications/pdfs/654.pdf |isbn=92-9043-318-3 |page=6 |format = PDF |accessdate = 2011-06-12}}</ref>

[[Image:Durio Zibethinus Van Nooten.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Durio zibethinus''. [[Chromolithograph]] by Hoola Van Nooten, circa 1863]]
''D. zibethinus'' was introduced into [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] by the Portuguese in the 16th century and was reintroduced many times later. It has been planted in the Americas but confined to [[botanical garden]]s. The first seedlings were sent from the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], to [[Auguste Saint-Arroman]] of [[Dominica]] in 1884.<ref name = Agro>{{cite web | url = http://www.worldagroforestry.org/SEA/Products/AFDbases/AF/asp/SpeciesInfo.asp?SpID=715 | title = Agroforestry Tree Database&nbsp;<U+2014> ''Durio zibethinus'' | publisher = International Center for Research in Agroforestry | accessdate = 2008-11-20}}</ref>

In southeastern Asia the durian has been cultivated for centuries at the village level, probably since the late 18th century, and commercially since the mid-20th century.<ref name=Brown/> In ''My Tropic Isle'', [[Australia]]n author and [[naturalist]] [[Edmund James Banfield]] tells how, in the early 20th century, a friend in Singapore sent him a durian seed, which he planted and cared for on his tropical island off the north coast of [[Queensland]].<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Edmund James Banfield|Banfield, E.

In 1949, the British botanist [[E. J. H. Corner]] published ''The Durian Theory, or the Origin of the Modern Tree''. His theory was that [[Zoochorous|endozoochory]] (the enticement of animals to transport seeds in their stomach) arose before any other method of [[Biological dispersal|seed dispersal]], and that primitive ancestors of ''Durio'' species were the earliest practitioners of that dispersal method, in particular red durian (''D. dulcis'') exemplifying the primitive fruit of flowering plants.

Since the early 1990s, the domestic and international demand for durian in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ([[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]]) region has increased significantly, partly due to the increasing affluence of Asia.<ref name=Brown/>

==Uses==
===Culinary===
[[Image:Es Durian.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A street side durian ice cream in [[Bogor]]]]
Durian fruit is used to flavour a wide variety of sweet edibles such as traditional Malay candy, [[ice kacang]], [[dodol]], rose biscuits, and, with a touch of modern innovation, [[ice cream]], [[milkshake]]s, [[mooncake]]s, [[Yule log]]s and [[cappuccino]]. ''Es durian'' (durian ice cream) is a popular dessert in Indonesia, sold at street side stall in Indonesian cities, especially in Java. Pulut Durian is [[glutinous rice]] steamed with [[coconut milk]] and served with ripened durian.

[[Image:Tempoyak.jpg|thumb|left|''Tempoyak'', made from fermented durian]]
In Thailand, durian is often eaten fresh with sweet sticky rice, and blocks of durian paste are sold in the markets, though much of the paste is [[Adulterant|adulterated]] with [[pumpkin]].<ref name=Morton/> Unripe durians may be cooked as a vegetable, except in the Philippines, where all uses are sweet rather than savoury. Malaysians make both sugared and salted preserves from durian. When durian is minced with salt, onions and vinegar, it is called ''boder''. The durian seeds, which are the size of chestnuts, can be eaten whether they are boiled, roasted or fried in [[coconut oil]], with a texture that is similar to [[taro]] or [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], but stickier. In [[Java]], the seeds are sliced thin and cooked with sugar as a confection. Uncooked durian seeds are toxic due to [[cyclopropene]] [[fatty acid]]s and should not be ingested.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.science.edu.sg/ssc/detailed.jsp?artid=3452&type=6&root=4&parent=4&cat=49 | publisher = Singapore Science Centre | title = Question No. 18085: Is it true that durian seeds are poisonous? | accessdate = 2008-11-20 | year = 2006| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080220083720/http://www.science.edu.sg/ssc/detailed.jsp?artid=3452&type=6&root=4&parent=4&cat=49| archivedate = February 20, 2008}}</ref> Young leaves and [[shoot]]s of the durian are occasionally cooked as [[greens (vegetable)|greens]].

In the 1920s, Durian Fruit Products, Inc., of New York City launched a product called "Dur-India" as a health food supplement, selling at [[US$]]9 for a dozen bottles, each containing 63 tablets.

The company promoted the supplement saying that it provides "more concentrated healthful energy in food form than any other product the world affords".<ref name=Morton/>

==Customs and beliefs==

Southeast Asian folk beliefs, as well as [[traditional Chinese medicine]], consider the durian fruit to have warming properties liable to cause [[excessive sweating]].<ref>{{cite book | title = The Pharmacology of Chinese Herbs (Second Edition) | author = Huang, Kee C. | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | page = 2 | isbn = 0-8493-1665-0 | year = 1998}}</ref> The traditional method to counteract this is to pour water into the empty shell of the fruit after the pulp has been consumed and drink it.<ref name=Davidson/> An alternative method is to eat the durian in accompaniment with [[mangosteen]], which is considered to have cooling properties. Pregnant women or people with [[high blood pressure]] are traditionally advised not to consume durian.<ref name="Fuller"/><ref>{{cite book | title = Medical Anthropology in Ecological Perspective | author = McElroy, Anne and  Townsend, Patricia K. | publisher = Westview Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-8133-3821-2 | page = 253}}</ref>

Another common local belief is that the durian is harmful when eaten with [[coffee]]<ref name=Davidson/> or alcoholic beverages.<ref name=Brown/> The latter belief can be traced back at least to the 18th century when [[Rumphius]] stated that one should not drink alcohol after eating durians as it will cause indigestion and [[Halitosis|bad breath]]. In 1929, J. D. Gimlette wrote in his ''Malay Poisons and Charm Cures'' that the durian fruit must not be eaten with [[brandy]]. In 1981, J. R. Croft wrote in his ''Bombacaceae: In Handbooks of the Flora of Papua New Guinea'' that "a feeling of morbidity" often follows the consumption of alcohol too soon after eating durian. Several medical investigations on the validity of this belief have been conducted with varying conclusions,<ref name=Brown/> though a study by the [[University of Tsukuba]] finds the fruit's high sulphur content caused the body to inhibit the activity of [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]], causing a 70% reduction of the ability to clear toxins from the body.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327253.200-durians-and-booze-worse-than-a-stinking-hangover.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&nsref=online-news | title = Durians and booze: worse than a stinking hangover | date = 2009-09-16 | accessdate = 2009-10-15 | publisher = ''[[New Scientist]]'' }}</ref>

The [[Javanese people|Javanese]] believe durian to have [[aphrodisiac]] qualities, and impose a set of rules on what may or may not be consumed with it or shortly thereafter.<ref name=Davidson/> A saying in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], ''durian jatuh sarung naik'', meaning "the durians fall and the [[sarong]]s come up", refers to this belief.<ref>{{cite book | title = A Comprehensive Indonesian-English Dictionary  | first = Alan M. | last = Stevens | coauthors = A.

[[Image:Durian with sharp thorns.jpg|left|thumb|Durian fruit is armed with sharp thorns, capable of drawing blood.]]
A durian falling on a person's head can cause serious injuries because it is heavy, armed with sharp thorns, and can fall from a significant height. Wearing a [[hardhat]] is recommended when collecting the fruit. [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] writes that death rarely ensues from it, because the copious [[effusion]] of blood prevents the inflammation which might otherwise take place.<ref name=Wallace/> A common saying is that a durian has eyes and can see where it is falling because the fruit allegedly never falls during daylight hours when people may be hurt.<ref>{{cite web | title = Encyclopedia of Asian Food | url = http://www.asiafood.org/glossary_1.cfm?alpha=D&startno=27&endno=51 | year = 1998 | accessdate = 2008-11-20 | publisher = Periplus | first = Charmaine | last = Solomon }}</ref> A saying in Indonesian, ''ketiban durian runtuh'', which translates to "getting a fallen durian", means receiving an unexpected luck or fortune.<ref>{{cite book | title = An Indonesian-English Dictionary | first = John M. |last = Echols| coauthors = Hassan Shadily |publisher= Cornell University Press |year = 1989 |isbn = 0-8014-2127-6| page = 292}}</ref> Nevertheless, signs warning people not to linger under durian trees are found in Indonesia.<ref>{{cite book | title = Indonesia (Lonely Planet Travel Guides) | first = Justine |last = Vaisutis | coauthors = Neal Bedford, Mark Elliott, Nick Ray, Ryan Ver Berkmoes | pages = 393<U+2013>394 | publisher = Lonely Planet Publications | isbn = 1-74104-435-9 | year = 2007}}</ref>

A naturally spineless variety of durian growing wild in [[Davao]], Philippines, was discovered in the 1960s; fruits borne from these seeds also lacked spines.<ref name=Brown/> Since the bases of the scales develop into spines as the fruit matures, sometimes spineless durians are produced artificially by scraping scales off immature fruits.<ref name=Brown/>

[[Image:The Esplanade 4, Singapore, Dec 05.JPG|right|thumb|Singapore's [[Esplanade <U+2013> Theatres on the Bay|Esplanade]] building, nicknamed "The Durian"]]
The durian is commonly known as the "King of the Fruits",<ref name=Heaton/> a label that can be attributed to its formidable look and overpowering odour.<ref>The [[mangosteen]], called the "queen of fruits", is petite and mild in comparison. The mangosteen season coincides with that of the durian and is seen as a complement, which is probably how the mangosteen received the complementary title.</ref> In its native southeastern Asia, the durian is an everyday food and portrayed in the local media in accordance with the cultural perception it has in the region. The durian symbolised the subjective nature of ugliness and beauty in [[Hong Kong]] director [[Fruit Chan]]'s [[2000 in film|2000 film]] ''[[Durian Durian]]'' (<U+69B4><U+69E4><U+98C4><U+98C4>, ''lau lin piu piu''), and was a nickname for the reckless but lovable protagonist of the eponymous Singaporean TV comedy ''Durian King'' played by [[Adrian Pang]].<ref name=STB>{{cite web | title = Uniquely Singapore&nbsp;<U+2014> July 2006 Issue | url = http://www.visitsingapore.com/publish/stbportal/en/home/about_singapore/ezine_home/Jul06/local_speak/Durain_Story.html | year = 2006 | publisher = Singapore Tourism Board| accessdate = 2007-07-31 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070823005745/http://www.visitsingapore.com/publish/stbportal/en/home/about_singapore/ezine_home/Jul06/local_speak/Durain_Story.html | archivedate=2007-08-23}}</ref> Likewise, the oddly shaped [[Esplanade <U+2013> Theatres on the Bay|Esplanade]] building in Singapore is often called "The Durian" by locals,<ref name=STB/> and "The Big Durian" is the nickname of [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/yesterdaydetail.asp?fileid=20070622.B10 |
