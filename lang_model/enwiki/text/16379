Tel Aviv is located on Israel's [[Israeli Coastal Plain|Mediterranean coastline]] over an area covering 50,553 [[dunam]]s ({{convert|19.5|sqmi|sqkm|1}}). It is the main city of the largest and most populous [[metropolitan area]] in Israel, the [[Gush Dan]] (Dan Bloc), whose population numbers 3.04 million as of 2005<!--2007 est. 3.150.800)-->.<ref>{{cite web |title=Localities, Population and Density per sq. km., by Metropolitan Area and Selected Localities |work=Statistical Abstract of Israel 2006 |publisher = [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]] |url=http://www1.cbs.gov.il/shnaton57/st02_15.pdf | accessdate=2007-05-31 | date=2006-12-31}}</ref> Tel Aviv is recognised as a [[global city#GaWC Inventory of World Cities, 1999|strong candidate global city]], and has been named the most expensive [[Middle East]]ern city to live in.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercerhr.com/referencecontent.jhtml?idContent=1268475|title=Worldwide Cost of Living Survey 2007 <U+2013> city rankings|publisher=[[Mercer Human Resource Consulting]]|date=2007-06-18 | accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref>

The City of Tel Aviv was originally founded in the 1909 by Jewish immigrants as an alternative to expensive housing in the neighbouring historic port city of [[Jaffa]] ({{lang-he|<U+05D9><U+05E4><U+05D5>}}, ''Yafo''; {{lang-ar|<U+064A><U+0627><U+0641><U+0627>}}, ''Yafa''). Tel Aviv's extensive growth eventually overtook its [[Arab]]-majority neighbour, and the two towns were united into the municipality of Tel Aviv-Yafo in 1950, two years after the [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|establishment of the State of Israel]]. Tel Aviv is today considered the center of Israel's globally oriented economy, and is the anchor of the area popularly known as "[[Silicon Wadi]]". It is also considered Israel's cultural capital due to its vibrant, modern, cosmopolitan character.<ref name="GAWC">{{cite web| url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/rb/rb57.html| title=Tel Aviv, Israel - A World City in Evolution:

==Etymology==

In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the name Tel Aviv translates as "Hill (''[[tell|tel]]'') of [[Spring (season)|Spring]] (''aviv'')". This is the title given by [[Nahum Sokolow]] to his Hebrew translation of [[Theodor Herzl]]'s book ''Altneuland'' ([[German language|German]]: "[[The Old New Land]]"). There is an account that Sokolow came up with the Hebrew title "Tel Aviv" to allude to the destruction of the ancient Jewish state and its hoped-for restoration: ''aviv'' = "spring" to symbolize renewal, and ''tel'' to symbolize the destruction of the ancient state, following not the usual Hebrew meaning of the word "tel" but its use in [[archaeology]], meaning "mound of accumulated ruins".<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vie/Telaviv.html | title=Tel Aviv | accessdate=2007-07-18 | publisher=Jewish Virtual Library}}</ref> Sokolow took the name from the [[Book of Ezekiel]] {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Ezekiel|chapter=3|verse=15|nobook=}} : "Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel Aviv, that lived by the river Chebar, and to where they lived; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days." (The spelling in the [[King James Version of the Bible]] is ''Telabib''.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://king-james-bible.classic-literature.co.uk/the-book-of-the-prophet-ezekiel/ebook-page-03.asp | title=The Book of the Prophet Ezekiel | publisher=King James Bible | accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref>) The ''[[Abib|Aviv]]'' referred to is possibly an indirect reference to a [[Mesopotamian mythology|Mesopotamian god or goddess]] believed to bring forth the season of spring.

Jaffa in Hebrew is ''Yafo'', which may be derived from ''yafah''/''yofi'', meaning "beautiful". Tradition holds that Jaffa was founded by and named after [[Japheth]], son of [[Noah]]. The city is also mentioned in the [[book of Jonah]], and, by the name of "Japo", on an ancient Egyptian tax register clay tablet found at Tel el-[[Amarna]].<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.israelmybeloved.com/channel/israel_today/section/cities_towns | title=Cities & Towns:Israel Today | quote=The name Yafo comes from the name of Noah's son Japheth, or Yafet | accessdate=2007-07-18}}</ref><ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.joppadesign.com/joppa.html | title=What does Joppa mean? | accessate=2007-07-18 | publisher=Joppa Design | quote=Joppa, meaning beautiful in Greek, was the word that seemed to fit.}}</ref>

[[Image:TelAviv-paam4.jpg|thumb|Early Tel Aviv]]

{{see|Jaffa#History}}

The gulf of Jaffa has been the site of a fortified port town for at least 4000 years, and as such is the oldest port in the world. During the 19th century, the town<U+2019>s population grew from about 2,500 in 1806 to 17,000 in 1886. The old city walls could no longer contain the population, and they were destroyed in the 1870s, allowing for newer, more spacious neighborhoods to be constructed.<ref name="yahoo">{{Citeweb | url=http://uk.holidaysguide.yahoo.com/p-travelguide-122544-tel_aviv_history-i | title=Tel Aviv History |  accessdate=2007-07-18 | publisher=Yahoo UK Travel}}</ref>

Settlement in the area of modern southern Tel Aviv (the neighbourhoods of [[Neve Tzedek]] and [[Neve Shalom (Tel Aviv)|Neve Shalom]]<!--not to be confused with the much later Arab-Jewish cooperative village by the same name-->) began in the 1880s as a substitute for the relatively expensive Arab neighbourhoods of Jaffa by some of the town's distinguished Jewish residents.<ref name="yahoo" />

In 1908 the ''Ahuzat Bayit'' (<U+05D0><U+05D7><U+05D5><U+05D6><U+05EA> <U+05D1><U+05D9><U+05EA>) homebuilders association bought land north of Jaffa. Building commenced in 1909, and the association admitted members of two suburbs established nearby.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.israel.org/MFA/History/Modern%20History/Centenary%20of%20Zionism/Lexicon%20of%20Zionism | title=Lexicon of Zionism - Ahuzat Bayit | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs}}</ref> In 1910, the common name of Tel Aviv was adopted.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.akhlah.com/israel/cities/telaviv.php | title=Akhlah: Cities & Sites in Israel | quote="In 1910, the name was changed to Tel Aviv | accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref> At its founding, Tel Aviv was intended only to be a [[bedroom community]] of Jaffa. The founders envisaged a European-style [[Garden city movement|garden suburb]] with wide streets and boulevards.<ref name="brit">{{citeweb | url=http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9071570 | title=Tel Aviv-Yafo | publisher=Britannica Concise Encyclopedia | accessdate-2007-07-19}}</ref>

Tel Aviv's growth was halted in 1914 when the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] authorities expelled its inhabitants. However, its residents returned and resumed development following the British conquest. The period of [[British Mandate of Palestine|British administration]] saw increasing political friction between Jews and Arabs throughout Palestine, and in May 1921, dozens of Jews were killed by an Arab mob in the [[Jaffa riots]]. Soon after, thousands of the 16,000 Jews of Jaffa moved north to Tel Aviv. Following the violence, the inhabitants of Tel Aviv created a new [[central business district]]. The [[Urban planning|master plan]] for development of the city, based on a framework of central routes and [[boulevard]]s, was designed in 1925 by [[Patrick Geddes]] and adopted by the city council under [[Meir Dizengoff]]. Owing to its proximity to the port of Jaffa, and its status as the first Jewish community that immigrants saw when coming into the country, Tel Aviv quickly grew to become the centre of Israeli urban life, which it remains to this day. Due to the [[1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936-1939 Arab rioting]], a local port was opened in 1938, which was an important milestone marking its independence from Jaffa.

According to the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181|1947 UN Partition Plan]], Palestine was to be partitioned into Jewish and Arab states. Tel Aviv was to be part of the Jewish state, while Jaffa, was to become an [[enclave]] belonging to the Arab state. The plan was rejected by the Arabs, and violence erupted immediately. During an offensive on Jaffa that started in April 1948, many of its Arab residents [[Palestinian exodus|fled]] through the harbor. When Jaffa was taken on May 14, only about 4,100 out of its 70,000 Arab residents remained.<ref name="brit" />

Israel's [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|Declaration of Independence]] took place in Tel Aviv on [[May 14]], [[1948]], and it served as Israel's provisional capital throughout the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] due to the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1948)|Arab blockade of Jerusalem]], which was proclaimed capital in December 1949. Due to the international dispute over the status of Jerusalem, most embassies stayed in the Tel Aviv area. Thirteen more returned there in the early eighties as part of the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 478|UN's punitive measures]] responding to Israel's 1980 [[Jerusalem Law]].<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.icaj.nl/nieuwsbrief/sep2005/25_jaar_ambassade.htm | title=Vijfentwintig jaar Ambassade Wonderen | accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign%20Relations/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947/1979-1980/119%20Foreign%20Ministry%20reaction%20to%20the%20transfer%20of%20t |title=Foreign Ministry reaction to the transfer of the Dutch embassy from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv | date=1980-08-26 |accessdate=2007-06-03 |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |work=Israel's Foreign Relations: Selected Documents}}</ref> Today all but two of the international embassies to Israel are in Tel Aviv or the surrounding district.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.science.co.il/Embassies.asp|title=Embassies and Consulates in Israel |accessdate=2007-07-18 |publisher=Israel Science and Technology|work=Israel Science and Technology Homepage}}</ref> In April, 1949, Tel Aviv and Jaffa were united in the single municipality Tel Aviv-Yafo, and the lands of neighboring villages such as [[al-Shaykh_Muwannis]], Jammasin and Sumail, which were depopulated during the war, were incorporated into the united municipality.<ref name="EJ">{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Tel Aviv-Jaffa |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] |publisher=[[Thomson Gale]]}}</ref> Tel Aviv thus grew to {{convert|42|sqkm|sqmi|1}}.

Tel Aviv has suffered violence and terrorism at the hands of [[:Category:Palestinian militant groups|Palestinian militant groups]] over the course of several decades. The first [[suicide attack]] in Tel Aviv occurred on [[October 19]], [[1994]], when a [[Tel Aviv bus 5 massacre|suicide bomber exploded on the Line 5 bus]] killing himself and 25 civilians, as part of a [[Hamas]] suicide campaign. This was followed, on [[March 4]], [[1996]], when another [[Dizengoff Center massacre|suicide bomber exploded nearby at an ATM]] during [[Purim]] holiday festivities and killed 18 civilians. <U+041E>n [[June 1]], [[2001]], during the [[Second Intifada]], a suicide bomber [[Dolphinarium massacre|exploded in a line for a discotheque]] and 32 were killed and more than 100 were injured. On [[January 25]], [[2002]], [[Tel-Aviv central bus station massacres|20 were killed in a suicide attack]] near the old [[Tel Aviv Central Bus Station|Central Bus Station]], and on [[January 5]], [[2003]], in two nearly simultaneous attacks, 23 were killed. On [[17 April]], [[2006]], 10 people were killed and dozens wounded in another suicide attack in the same location, with many of the victims in these attacks being foreign labourers.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.adl.org/Israel/israel_attacks.asp | title=Major Terrorist Attacks in Israel | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=Anti-Defamation League}}</ref>

Today, Tel Aviv-Yafo represents the heart of a thriving Israeli metropolis; the [[Gush Dan]] greater metropolitan area comprises a number of separate municipalities with approximately 1.1 million people living in a {{convert|15|sqkm|sqmi|1}} long stretch of Mediterranean coast. Tel Aviv-Yafo's population of 360,400 makes it the second largest city in Israel after Jerusalem. It is bordered by the [[satellite town|satellite cities]] of [[Rishon LeZion]], [[Petah Tikva]], [[Holon]], [[Bnei-Brak]], [[Bat Yam]], [[Herzliya]], [[Ramat Gan]], [[Giv'atayim]], and [[Ramat HaSharon]].

== Geography==

===Topography and climate===

Tel Aviv is located around {{Coor dm|32|5|N|34|48|E|}} on the [[Israeli Coastal Plain|Israeli Mediterranean Coastal Plain]], the [[Via Maris|historic land bridge]] between [[Europe]], [[Africa]], and [[Asia]]. Immediately north of Jaffa, Tel Aviv is situated on land which used to be sand dunes, and as such has relatively poor soil fertility. It is now on flat land with no notable gradients. As such, its most notable geographical feature are the bluffs above the Mediterranean coastline and the [[Yarkon River]]'s mouth. In modern times, due to the expansion of Tel Aviv and the Gush Dan region in general, absolute borders between Tel Aviv and Jaffa, and between the city's neighbourhoods do not exist. The city is located some 60 kilometers (37 mi) northwest of [[Jerusalem]], Israel's capital city, and some {{convert|90|km|mi|1}} south of the northern port city of [[Haifa]]. 

Tel Aviv has a [[subtropical]], [[mediterranean climate]] with hot summers, pleasant springs and autumns, and cool, rainy, mild winters. Humidity tends to be high all year round, and rain usually occurs between October to May. In winter, temperatures seldom drop below 5<U+00B0>C and are more likely to be in the region of 10<U+00B0> to 15<U+00B0>C , while in summer the average is 26<U+00B0>C. The average annual rainfall is {{convert|530|mm|in|1}}.<ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.wordtravels.com/Cities/Israel/Tel+Aviv/Climate | title=Tel Aviv Climate and Weather | publisher=World Travels | accessdate=2007-07-10}}</ref> Tel Aviv boasts on average over 300 sunny days a year. The autumn and spring periods are short, and with climate change appear to be shrinking. Many see the best time of year in Tel Aviv as April when the sun is bright, temperatures are moderate, humidity is down, and the flowers are in bloom.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.ess.co.at/SUTRA/CITIES/telaviv.html | title=Tel Aviv, Israel | accessdate=2007-07-10}}</ref>

===Districts===

{{see|Neighborhoods of Tel Aviv}}

Tel Aviv is made up of a large number of districts which have formed naturally over the city's short history. The most notable of these is [[Jaffa]], the ancient port city which Tel Aviv grew out of. This area is traditionally made up demographically of a greater percentage of Arabs, but recent [[gentrification]] is finding them replaced by a [[yuppie]] population. Similar processes are occurring in nearby [[Neve Tzedek]], the original Jewish neighbourhood outside of Jaffa. [[Ramat Aviv]], a neighbourhood north of the city centre largely made up of luxury apartments, is currently undergoing extensive expansion and is set to absorb the beachfront property of [[Sde Dov Airport]] after its decommissioning.<ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3420369,00.html | title=Tel Aviv airport to make way for luxury project | accessdate=2007-07-03 | date=2007-07-03 | author=Ofer Petersburg}}</ref>

===Architecture===
[[Image:86cj.jpg|thumb|right|The pagoda house in central Tel Aviv]]
[[Image:TLVGYS 060PAN.JPG|thumb|Central Tel Aviv Panorama]]

Modern Tel Aviv is notable for two of its architectural styles. Of greatest international notability is the [[White City (Tel Aviv)|White City]] which was designated by [[UNESCO]] in July 2003 as a [[World Heritage Site]] due to its 2500 structures constructed in the [[Bauhaus]], or [[International style (architecture)|International Style]].<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&id_site=1096 | title=White City of Tel Aviv | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=UNESCO}}</ref> These buildings were built largely between the 1930s and 1950s as the modernist art movement reached its apogee in Europe by many Jewish architects who had trained in the style in pre-Nazi era Germany. Tel Aviv now boasts the largest collection of such buildings anywhere in the world,<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.gemsinisrael.com/index000004872.htm | title=tel aviv bahaus | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=Gems in Israel}}</ref> which tie in with its [[Garden City]] styling and the city's many wide-boulevards.

More recently, Tel Aviv has become a hub of modern [[high-rise]] architecture due to astronomically high land values and the concurrent deterioration of many low-quality buildings constructed in the 1960s to cope with Israel's [[aliyah|mass-immigration]]. [[Shalom Meir Tower|Shalom Tower]], [[Azrieli Center]], and the [[YOO Towers]], designed by [[Phillipe Stark]] and currently under construction, are among the city's internationally significant [[skyscraper]]s.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/?id=100280 | title=Tel Aviv-Yaffo Buildings | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=Emporis}}</ref>

==Demographics==

The city itself has a population of 382,500 over an area covering 50,553 [[dunam]]s ({{convert|50.6|sqkm|sqmi|1}}) giving a population density of 7,445 people per km<U+00B2>. According to the [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]] (CBS), as of June [[2006]], Tel Aviv's population is growing at an annual rate of 0.9%. It consists of 91.8% [[Jew]]s, 4.2% [[Arab]]s and 4.0% "other".<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www1.cbs.gov.il/webgis/website/yishuvim/yishuvim_2005/XLS/bycode.xls | title=Tel Aviv Ethnic Breakdown | publisher=Israel Central Bureau of Statistics | date=2005-12-31 | accessdate=2007-07-07}}"Others" refers to non-Arab Christians and unclassified.</ref> According to some estimates, about 50,000 unregistered [[foreign worker]]s live in Tel Aviv.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://migration.ucdavis.edu/MN/more.php?id=1041_0_5_0 | title=Migration News | accessdate=2007-05-22}}</ref>  

According to December 2001 statistics, Tel Aviv's socio-economic status was classified as high (8 out of 10) and 63.1% percent of twelfth grade students received graduation certificates in 2000. In 2000, the average monthly wage stood at 6,773 NIS, which is roughly equal to the national average. In the city the population was spread out with 22.2% aged under 20, 18.5% aged 20-29, 24% aged 30-44, and 16.2% aged between 45 and 59. 19.1% of the city's population is aged over 60.

===Religion===

Whilst Jerusalem is regarded as Israel's religious hub, Tel Aviv is percieved as a secular, culturally open coastal city. Despite this, Tel Aviv still has about 500 [[synagogue]]s, of which some 350 are active. Tel Aviv, especially in Jaffa, has a sizable Muslim population and contains a number of Mosques. Furthermore, in part due to the many embassies and foreign diplomatic staff located in Tel Aviv-Yafo and the surrounding areas, and the Christian Arab population of Yafo, a number of churches have been established in and around the city.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.dailyjews.com/articles/482_holy_tel_aviv_tours.htm | title=Holy Tel Aviv tours  | publisher=www.dailyjews.com | accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref>

== Culture==
===Arts and theatre===
[[Image:Mishkan.jpg|thumb|One of the Tel Aviv performing arts centre entrances]]
[[Image:800px-Tel Aviv Beachs.jpg|thumb|Tel Aviv's coastline]]

Many see Tel Aviv as Israel's cultural capital.<ref name=GAWC/> Cultural centers in Tel Aviv include the [[Opera House (Tel Aviv)|Opera House]] where [[Pl<U+00E1>cido Domingo]] was the house tenor between 1962 and 1965, as well as the [[Hall of Culture (Tel Aviv)|Hall of Culture]], a 3,000 seat theatre. The Israeli National Theater, [[Habima Theater]] ("The Stage") is the most recognized of its many theatre companies and theatre halls, but the Tel Aviv Municipal [[Cameri Theater]], the Jaffa-based Gesher Theater, and Beit Lessin Theater are also popular. Tzavta and Tmuna are smaller theaters used mainly for musical and fringe productions. In Jaffa, the Simta and Notzar theaters specialize in fringe.

===Museums===
Israel has the highest number of museums per capita of any country, many of them in Tel Aviv.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.israeliconsulatela.org/culture/Science.asp | title=Science & Technology | publisher=Consulate General of Israel in Los Angeles | accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> Among the most notable are the [[Eretz Israel Museum]] which is known for its rich collection of archaeology and history exhibits dealing with the [[Land of Israel]], and the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]] which is one of the major art museums in Israel. Housed on the campus of [[Tel Aviv University]] is the [[Beit Hatefutsot]], a museum of the international Jewish diaspora. Containing both historical documents and art, the museum tells the story of Jewish prosperity and persecution throughout the [[Jewish diaspora|centuries of exile]]. [[Batey Haosef Museum]] is a showcase of the [[Israel Defense Forces]]' [[military history]], containing rare exhibits and authentic pieces from Israel's history as well as a wide variety of firearms and pictures. Meanwhile, the [[Palmach|Palmach Museum]] near Tel Aviv University gives visitors a multimedia experience of the history of the Palmach, as well as vast archives, depicting the lives of young self-trained Jewish soldiers who eventually became the first defenders of Israel. Near [[Charles Clore]]'s garden in north Jaffa is a small museum of the [[Irgun|Etzel]] Jewish militant organization, one of whose achievements was conquering Jaffa for Israel in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]]. The [[Tel Aviv Exhibition Centre]] which is located in one of the northern sides of the city, hosts over 60 major events every year. Many offbeat museums and galleries are located in the city's artsy southern areas including the Tel Aviv Raw Art contemporary art gallery.

===Tourism and recreation===

Tel Aviv is a major tourist destination, combining a mediterranean feel with culture and complexity. The city has several public parks and gardens, the largest being [[the Yarkon Park]]. Gan Meir, named after first mayor [[Meir Dizengoff]], is on King George Street. Tel Aviv hosts the largest [[Pride parade|Gay Pride Parade]] in Israel (the only country to do so in the Middle East), drawing upwards of 100,000 people.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?c=JPArticle&cid=1181228573535&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull | title=Thousands join Tel Aviv gay pride parade | publisher=Jerusalem Post | date=2007-06-08 | accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref> Tel Aviv is known for its openness as well as its thriving night life.<ref name="night">{{citeweb | url=http://www.tel-aviv-insider.com/nightlife-1.php | title=bars in Tel Aviv | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=Tel Aviv Insider}}</ref> It holds many malls, such as Dizengoff Center (Israel's first mall) and the Azrieli Center. The city has many hotels, such as the Tel-Aviv King David Hotel, Sheraton, Four Seasons, Dan and Hilton. There is also buildings the Opera Tower where inside there is a mall. Tel-Aviv has been known in Israel as the city that never sleeps.<ref name="night" />

Tel Aviv-Yafo is known for its lively [[nightlife]] and around the clock culture. Its beachfront [[promenade]]s are especially a focal point of that atmosphere due to its myriad [[nightclub]]s and [[Bar (establishment)|Bar]]s.

Home to a large number of schools, colleges, and universities, Tel Aviv is a center for education in Israel with two universities, [[Tel Aviv University]], and [[Bar-Ilan University]] (with its campus in neighbouring [[Ramat Gan]]). These two universities give a combined student population of Tel Aviv reaching well over 50,000, of whom a sizeable number are international students.<ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.topuniversities.com/school_search/school_profile/?voidsess&sch_id=758 | title=Tel Aviv Univeristy | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=QS Top Universities}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Education/higher_ed.html | title=Higher Education | publisher=Jewish Virtual Library | accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref>

[[Tel Aviv University]] was founded in 1953 and is now the largest [[university]] in Israel with an excellent reputation internationally, especially for its [[physics]], [[computer science]], [[chemistry]] and [[linguistics]] departments, and is located in the [[Ramat Aviv]] neighbourhood. [[Bar-Ilan University]] was founded in 1955 and is located in the suburb of [[Ramat Gan]]. It is Israel's largest academic community.

===Sports===

Tel Aviv is home to some of the top sports teams in Israel, including a world-class basketball team. Tel Aviv is the only city with three teams in the [[Israeli football]] premier league. [[Maccabi Tel Aviv|Maccabi Tel Aviv Sports Club]] was founded in 1906 and competes in over ten sports including [[Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv Basketball Club]] which has forty-seven Israeli titles, won thirty-six editions of the Israel cup, and has five European Championships and [[Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C.]] which has eighteen Israeli league titles, won twenty-two editions of the Israel cup, two Israel Toto cup and two Asia cups. Maccabi's [[Judo]] club athlete Yael Arad won a silver medal in the 1992 [[Olympic Games]].<ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.databaseolympics.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=ARADYAE01 | title=Yael Arad | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=Olympic Database}}</ref>

[[Hapoel Tel Aviv]] Sports Club was founded in 1923, and over the years has included over eleven sports,<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/il@hapta.html | title=Hapoel Tel Aviv | accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref> including the [[Hapoel Tel Aviv B.C.|Hapoel Tel Aviv Basketball Club]] (five Israeli championships, four Israeli cups) and the [[Hapoel Tel Aviv F.C.|Hapoel Tel Aviv Football Club]] (thirteen Israeli championships, eleven Israeli cups, one Toto cup and once Asia champion), kayaking Club, women's basketball club and more that have always been amongst the top Israeli clubs.

[[Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv F.C.|Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv]]'s football club (once Israeli champion, twice Israeli cup holder and twice Israeli Toto cup holder) is the only Israeli football team in the top division (''Ligat Ha'al'') that represents a neighbourhood - ''Shechunat Hatikva'' ("The Hope Neighbourhood") in Tel Aviv - and not a city.

Other football clubs which used to play in the top division were [[Shimshon Tel Aviv F.C.|Shimshon Tel Aviv]] and [[Beitar Tel Aviv F.C.|Beitar Tel Aviv]], which are now merged into one team ([[Beitar/Shimshon Tel Aviv F.C.|Beitar/Shimshon Tel Aviv]] that plays in the third division ([[Liga Artzit]]). [[Maccabi Jaffa F.C.|Maccabi Jaffa]] is another former 1st division team that currently plays in the lower divisions.

Tel Aviv is also the home of many other sports. Two [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] clubs operate in Tel Aviv. The Tel Aviv Rowing Club, which was established as early as 1935 on the banks of the Yarkon River, is the biggest rowing club in Israel.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.rowersalmanac.com/profiles/israel.asp | title=Rowers Almanac | accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref> Meanwhile, the beaches of Tel Aviv provide arguably the most vibrant [[Matkot]] scene in the world.<ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.telaviv-insider.co.il/sports.php | title=Sports in the Tel-Aviv | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=Tel Aviv Insider}}</ref>

The [[Israel Baseball League]] begins it's inaugural season in June, with the [[Tel Aviv Lightning]] representing the city.

==Economy==

The economy of Tel Aviv has developed dramatically over the past decades, and as well as being Israel's economic capital, the bustling city has now been described as a flourishing technological center by [[Newsweek]] and a "miniature [[Los Angeles]]" by [[The Economist]].<ref name="Newsweek">Levy, Stephen & Matt Rees, "Focus on Technology: The Hot New Tech Cities"; ''[[Newsweek]]'', [[1998]]-[[11-09]] <!-- (online: 1998-11-04) "Massive immigration from Russia in the early '90s brought the country a flood of computer scientists with advanced theoretical knowledge." --></ref><ref name="Economist">{{citeweb | url=http://www.economist.com/cities/findStory.cfm?city_id=TLV&folder=Facts-Figures#Economic_profile | title=Tel Aviv City Guide | accessdate=2007-05-28 | publisher=The Economist}}</ref> Many computer scientists now live and work in Tel Aviv. Their numbers increased as a result of immigration from the former Soviet Union since the early 1990s. The city is considered by Newsweek to be one of the top ten most technologically influential cities in the world. Actually, it is the [[metropolitan area]] (including suburbs such as [[Herzlia]] and [[Petah Tikva]]) that contains much of Israel's high-tech muscle which has become known as [[Silicon Wadi]].<ref name="Newsweek" />

Historically, Tel Aviv struggled to find a niche economic position. The city's location on sand dunes was not suited for agricultural usage, and its sea shore poorly suited for a seaport, a role assumed by nearby [[Haifa]] and [[Ashdod]]. Slowly, the city developed a reputation as a centre for scientific and technical research. In 1974, [[Intel]] opened its first overseas research and development operation in Israel, and Tel Aviv finally emerged in the high-tech map in the 1990s following an economic boom.<ref name="Economist" />

Tel Aviv is home to the [[Tel Aviv Stock Exchange]], (TASE), Israel's only stock exchange, which in recent times has reached record heights,<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jun2007/gb20070621_251927.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_global+business | title=Israel: A Hotbed of...Investment | publisher=[[BusinessWeek]] | date=[[2007]]-[[06-21]] | accessdate=2007-07-07 | last=Sandler |first=Neal}}</ref> as well as many international headquarters of venture-capital firms, scientific research institutes, and high-tech companies. Having said this, there is some industry in the Tel Aviv area, and goods such as chemicals, textiles and food are exported from factories here.<ref name="Economist" /> Also important to the Tel Aviv economy is tourism, and people travel from around the world to this city not only because of the plethora of cultural sites which Israel can offer, but also because of its legendary nightlife, atmosphere, and architecture.<ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.thomsonfly.com/en/destination_3863.html | title=Tel Aviv | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=Thomsonfly}}</ref>

The Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network (GaWC) at [[Loughborough University]]  constructed an inventory of [[world cities]] based upon their level of advanced producer services. The inventory includes Tel Aviv as having "strong evidence" of world city formation<U+2014>the highest ranking for a Middle Eastern city with the exception of partly-European [[Istanbul]].<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/citylist.html | title=Inventory of World Cities | publisher=Loughborough University | accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref>

Seven out of the nine Israeli [[billionaire]]s reside in Israel; of them, at least four live in Tel Aviv or its suburbs (according to [[Forbes]]).<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/10/07billionaires_The-Worlds-Billionaires_CountryOfCitizen_10.html | title=The World's Billionaires | accessdate=2007-07-07 | publisher=Forbes}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/81/biz_06israel_Israels-Richest_land.html | title=Israel's 40 Richest | date=2006-12-09 | accessdate=2007-07-07 | publisher=Forbes | author=Boaz Bin-Nun}}</ref> According to [[Mercer Human Resource Consulting|Mercer]], as of 2007, Tel Aviv is considered the most expensive city in the Middle East to live, and seventeenth most in the world. It falls just short of [[New York City]] and [[Dublin]] and right ahead of [[Rome]] and [[Vienna]].<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/06/15/pf/most_expensive_cities/index.htm?eref=rss_topstories | title=World's most expensive cities | publisher=CNNMoney | date=[[2007]]-[[06-18]] | accessdate=2007-06-18 | author=Sahadi, Jeanne}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.mercerhr.com/referencecontent.jhtml?idContent=1268475 | title=Worldwide Cost of Living Survey 2007 <U+2013> city rankings | date=[[2007]]-[[06-18]] | publisher=Mercer HR Consulting | accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref>

== Transportation ==
[[Image:Kirya bridge Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|Multimodal traffic in Tel Aviv: pedestrians, private vehicles, buses, trucks and taxis (and accessible from the other side of the building shown is also a train station).]]
[[Image:BenGuOut.jpg|thumb|Ben Gurion Airport is a destination served by many international airlines as well as Israeli carriers who fly from here to destinations across the world]]

===Road===

The main road access route to Tel Aviv is the [[Highway 20 (Israel)|Ayalon Highway]] (a.k.a. Highway 20), which runs along the eastern side of the city from north to south along the Ayalon River riverbed, divinding for the most part, Tel Aviv and [[Ramat Gan]]. Driving south on the Ayalon gives access to Highway 1, leading to [[Ben Gurion International Airport]] and [[Jerusalem]]. Within the city, the main routes are King George Street, [[Allenby Street]], [[Ibn Gabirol Street]], [[Dizengoff Street]], [[Rothschild Boulevard]] and in [[Jaffa]], Jerusalem Boulevard. Other access routes include Namir Road (which connects to Highway 2, and provides access from the North) and Begin/Jabotinsky Road (which provides access from the east, through Ramat Gan, Bnei Brak and Petach Tiqva).

===Rail===

Tel Aviv has four [[Israel Railways|train stations]] all located along the Ayalon Highway. The stops are from north to south: Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv Merkaz (Tel Aviv Central Train Station), Tel Aviv Hashalom (near [[David Azrieli|Azrieli]] Center shopping mall) and Tel Aviv Hahaganah (near the [[Tel Aviv Central Bus Station]]). It is estimated that over a million people use the train from the surrounding cities to Tel Aviv each month.

Furthermore, the first phase of the [[Tel Aviv Subway]] is planned to be completed by 2012, which is expected to improve public transportation in the city dramatically.<ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.subways.net/israel/telaviv.htm | title=Tel Aviv Subway (Planned) | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=Subways.net}}</ref>

===Bus===

The [[Tel Aviv Central Bus Station]], a large central [[bus]] station, is located in the south of the city. The main bus network in Tel Aviv is operated by [[Dan Bus Company]] whilst the [[Egged Bus Cooperative]], the world's second-largest bus company, provides intercity transportation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2001/11/Facets%20of%20the%20Israeli%20Economy-%20Transportation |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |title=Facets of the Israeli Economy &ndash; Transportation |date=[[2001-11-01]] |last=Solomon |first=Shoshanna |accessdate=2007-07-17}}</ref>

===Air===

Tel Aviv's airport is [[Sde Dov Airport|Dov Hoz Airport]] ''Sde Dov'' (code: SDV) which is located in the north-western side of the city and serves as a major airport for domestic flights. Sde Dov is, however, slated to close, as the land it is constructed on is prime-coastal real estate in the upscale [[Ramat Aviv]] neighbourhood.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/793988.html | title=Sde Dov to be vacated, state gets half of Big Bloc | accessdate=2007-07-17 | publisher=Haaretz| last=Bar-Eli |first=Avi| date=[[2006-11-30]]}}</ref> As such, sometime in the near future, all services to Sde Dov will transfer to [[Ben Gurion International Airport]] (code: TLV), Israel's main international airport, which is located 15km {{convert|15|km|mi|1}} south-east of Tel Aviv, close to the city of [[Lod]]. Because of its proximity to Tel Aviv and its location within the metropolitan area of Tel Aviv, Ben Gurion International Airport is often referred to as ''Tel Aviv International Airport'' despite the fact that the airport is not included in any municipal jurisdiction.
