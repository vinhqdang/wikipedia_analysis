{{Basic forms of government}}
'''Dictatorship''' is a [[form of government]] where political authority is  monopolized by a single person or political entity, and exercised through various mechanisms to ensure the entity's power remains strong.{{R|Encyclopaedia Britannica|quote1=dictatorship, form of government in which one person or a specific group possesses absolute power without effective constitutional limitations.}}<ref name="Power2008">{{cite book|author=Margaret Power|editor=Bonnie G. Smith|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EFI7tr9XK6EC&pg=RA1-PA55|accessdate=14 December 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-514890-9|pages=1<U+2013>|chapter=Dictatorship and Single-Party States }}</ref>

A dictatorship is a type of [[authoritarianism]], in which politicians regulate nearly every aspect of the public and private behavior of normal people. Dictatorships and totalitarianism generally employ political propaganda to decrease the influence of proponents of alternative governing systems, as is the nature of nationalism of any governing system.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, traditional [[monarchies]] gradually declined and disappeared. Dictatorship and [[constitutional democracy]] emerged as the world's two major forms of [[government]].{{R|Encyclopaedia Britannica}}

==History==
Between the two world wars, four types of dictatorships have been described: constitutional, communist (nominally championing "dictatorship of the proletariat"), counterrevolutionary, and fascist, and many have questioned the distinctions among these prototypes. Since [[World War II]] a broader range of dictatorships have been recognized including Third World dictatorships, theocratic or religious dictatorships and dynastic or family-based dictatorships.<ref name="Coppa2006">{{cite book|author=Frank J. Coppa|title=Encyclopedia of Modern Dictators: From Napoleon to the Present|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gTv99LBYSL4C|accessdate=25 March 2014|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-0-8204-5010-0|page=xiv|quote=In the period between the two world wars four types of dictatorships were described by a number of scholars: constitutional, the communist (nominally championing "dictatorship of the proletariat"), the counterrevolutionary, and the fascist. Many have rightfully questioned the distinctions between these prototypes. In fact, since World War II, we have recognized that the range of dictatorship is much broader than earlier posited and includes so-called Third World dictatorships in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East and religious dictatorships....They are also family dictatorships ....}}</ref>

=== Roman Empire ===
In the [[Roman Empire]], a [[Roman dictator]] was the incumbent of a political office of legislate of the [[Roman Republic]]. Roman dictators were allocated absolute power during times of emergency. Their power was originally neither arbitrary nor unaccountable, being subject to [[law]] and requiring retrospective justification. There were no such dictatorships after the beginning of the 2nd century BC, and later dictators such as [[Sulla]] and the [[Roman Emperor]]s exercised power much more personally and arbitrarily.

=== 19th century Latin America caudillo ===
After the collapse of Spanish colonial rule, various dictators emerged in many liberated countries. Often leading a private army, these [[Caudillo]] or self-appointed political-military leaders, attacked weak national governments once they control a regional political and economic powers, with examples such as [[Antonio L<U+00F3>pez de Santa Anna]] in [[Mexico]] and [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] in [[Argentina]]. Such dictators have been also referred to as "[[personalismo]]"{{R|Encyclopaedia Britannica}}.

The wave of [[military dictatorship]]s in [[Latin America]] in the second half of the twentieth century left a particular mark on Latin American culture. In [[Latin American literature]], the [[dictator novel]] challenging dictatorship and ''[[caudillo|caudillismo]]'', is a significant genre. There are also many [[films depicting Latin American military dictatorships]].

=== Stalinism and fascism in the 20th century dictatorships ===

[[File:Stalin birthday2.jpg| thumb | upright | 180px | [[People's Republic of China]] celebrate [[Joseph Stalin]]'s 70th birthday]]
In the first half of the 20th century, [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] and [[Fascism|fascist]] dictatorship regimes appeared in a variety of scientifically and technologically advanced countries, which are distinct from the dictatorship in Latin America and the post-colonial dictatorships in Africa and Asia. Leading examples of modern totalitarian dictatorship include: {{R|Encyclopaedia Britannica}}. 
* [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany]], [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Italy]], and other fascist dictatorships;
* [[Joseph Stalin]]'s  [[Soviet Union]], and other Stalinist and Soviet-style communist dictatorships that appeared after World War II in [[Central Europe]], [[Eastern Europe]], [[China]] and other countries.

===Dictatorships of Africa and Asia after World War II===
[[File:Mobutu Sese Seko 1973.jpg|thumb|[[Mobutu Sese Seko]], Zaire's longtime dictator.]]
After World War II, dictators established themselves in the several new states of Africa and Asia, often at the expense or failure of the constitutions inherited from the colonial powers. These constitutions often failed to work without a strong middle class or work against the preexisting autocratic rule. Some elected presidents and prime ministers captured power by suppressing the opposition and installing one-party rule, and some established military dictatorships through army.{{R|Encyclopaedia Britannica}}

The often-cited exploitative dictator is the regime of [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], who ruled [[Zaire]] from 1965 to 1997, embezzling over $5 billion from his country.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9709/07/mobutu.wrap/ Mobutu dies in exile in Morocco]</ref> Another classic case is the  [[Philippines]] under the rule of [[Ferdinand Marcos]].<ref name="AutoJF-17"/> He is reputed to have stolen some US$5<U+2013>10 billion.<ref name="AutoJF-18"/> More than $400 billion were stolen from the treasury by [[Nigeria]]'s leaders between 1960 and 1999.<ref name="AutoJF-19"/>

===Democratization===
The global dynamics of [[democratization]] has been a central question for political scientists.<ref name="Huntington2012">{{cite book|author=Samuel P. Huntington|title=The Third Wave: Democratization in the Late 20th Century|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IMjyTFG04JYC|date=6 September 2012|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-8604-7}}</ref><ref name="Brown2011">{{cite book|author=Nathan J.

==Measuring dictatorships==
[[File:Democracy Index 2011 green and red.svg|thumb|250px|right|[[Democracy Index]] by the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]], 2011.<ref name="AutoJF-1"/> Countries that are more red are authoritarian, and most often dictatorships. Most current dictatorships are in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]].]]
The conceptual and methodological differences in the [[political science]] literature exist with regards to measuring and classifying regimes into dictatorships and/or democracies, with prominent examples such as [[Freedom House]], [[Polity IV]]
and [[DD index]], and their [[validity]] and [[Reliability (research methods)|reliability]] being discussed.<ref name="ClarkGolder2014">{{cite book|author1=William Roberts Clark|author2=Matt Golder|author3=Sona N Golder|title=Principles of Comparative Politics|url=http://college.cqpress.com/sites/principlescp/Home/chapter5.aspx|date=23 March 2012|publisher=CQ Press|isbn=978-1-60871-679-1|chapter=Chapter 5. Democracy and Dictatorship: Conceptualization and Measurement}}</ref>

Roughly two research approaches exist: (1) the minimalist approach focuses on whether a country has continued elections that are competitive, and (2) the substantive approach expands the concept of democracy to include [[human rights]], [[freedom of the press]], the [[rule of law]], etc.<ref name="AutoJF-3"/><ref name="M<U+00F8>llerSkaaning2012"/><ref name="ClarkGolder2009"/>  The [[DD index]] is seen as an example of the minimalist approach, whereas the [[Polity data series]], relatively more substantive.<ref name="AutoJF-4"/>

==Types==
The most general term is [[despotism]], a form of government in which a single entity rules with absolute power.  That entity may be an individual, as in an [[autocracy]], or it may be a group,<ref name="AutoJF-6"/> as in an [[oligarchy]]. Despotism can mean [[tyrant|tyranny]] (dominance through threat of punishment and violence), or [[absolutism (European history)|absolutism]]; or dictatorship (a form of government in which the ruler is an absolute dictator, not restricted by a constitution, laws or opposition, etc.).<ref name="AutoJF-7"/> Dictatorship may take the form of [[authoritarianism]] or [[totalitarianism]].

Dictatorship is 'a form of government in which absolute power is concentrated in a dictator or a small clique' or 'a government organisation or group in which absolute power is so concentrated',<ref name="AutoJF-8"/>  whereas [[democracy]], with which the concept of dictatorship is often compared, is defined by most people as a form of government where those who govern are selected through contested elections. Authoritarian dictatorships are those where there is little political mobilization and "a small group exercises power within formally ill-defined limits but actually quite predictable ones".<ref name="AutoJF-9"/> Totalitarian dictatorships involve a "single party led by a single powerful individual with a powerful secret police and a highly developed ideology." Here, the government has "total control of mass communications and social and economic organizations".<ref name="AutoJF-10"/> [[Hannah Arendt]] labelled totalitarianism a new and extreme form of dictatorship involving "atomized, isolated individuals" in which ideology plays a leading role in defining how the entire society should be organised.<ref name="AutoJF-11"/> [[Juan Linz]] argues that the distinction between an authoritarian regime and a totalitarian one is that while an authoritarian one seeks to suffocate politics and political mobilization (depoliticization), a totalitarian one seeks to control politics and political mobilization.<ref name="AutoJF-12"/>

Dictatorships may be classified in a number of ways, such as:
* [[Military dictatorship]]
**"arbitrator" and "ruler" types may be distinguished; arbitrator regimes are professional, civilian-oriented, willing to give up power once problems have been resolved, and support the existing social order; "ruler" types view civilians as incompetent and have no intention of returning power to them, are politically organised, and have a coherent ideology<ref name="AutoJF-13"/>
* [[Single-party state]]
** "weak" and "strong" versions may be distinguished; in weak single-party states, "at least one other actor eclipses the role of the party (like a single individual, the military, or the president)."<ref name="AutoJF-14"/> [[Joseph Stalin]] era in [[Soviet Union]] <ref name="AutoJF-15"/> and [[Mao Zedong]] era in [[China]], [[Mustafa Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk]] and [[<U+0130>smet <U+0130>n<U+00F6>n<U+00FC>]] era in [[Turkey]] can be given as example.<ref name="AutoJF-16"/>
* [[Personalist]]
* Hybrid
** Some combination of the types above.

===Origins of power===
Dictators may rise to power in a number of ways.
* [[Family dictatorship]] - inheriting power through family ties
* [[Military dictatorship]] - through military force or [[coup d'etat]]. In Latin America, military dictatorships were often ruled by committees known as [[military junta]]s.
* [[Constitutional dictatorship]] - dictatorial powers provided for by constitutional means (often as a provison in case of emergency)
* [[Self-coup]] - by suspending existing democratic mechanisms after attaining office by constitutional means.
[[File:Marcos in Washington 1983.jpg|thumb|[[Ferdinand Marcos]], the dictator of the [[Philippines]]]]

===Stable dictatorship===
A '''stable dictatorship''' is a dictatorship that is able to remain in power for long periods. The stable dictatorship theory concerning the [[Soviet Union]] held that after the succession crisis following [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death, the victorious leader assumed the status of a Stalinist dictator without Stalin's [[Great Purge|terror apparatus]].<ref name="AutoJF-20"/> [[Chile under Pinochet|Chile]] and [[Paraguay]] were considered to be stable dictatorships in the 1970s.<ref name="AutoJF-21"/> It has been argued that stable dictatorships behave differently than unstable dictatorships. For instance, Maria Brouwer opines that "[[expansionary]] policies can fail and undermine the authority of the leader. Stable dictators, would therefore, be inclined to refrain from [[military aggression]]. This applies to [[History of China#Imperial era|imperial China]], [[Byzantium]] and [[Japan]], which refrained from expanding their empire at some point in time. Emerging dictators, by contrast, want to win the people<U+2019>s support by promising them riches from appropriating domestic or foreign wealth. They have not much to lose from failure, whereas success could elevate them to positions of wealth and power."<ref name="AutoJF-22"/>
