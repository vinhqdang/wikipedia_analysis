'''Charlotte Bront<U+00EB>''' ({{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|b|r|<U+0252>|n|t|i}} or {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|b|r|<U+0252>|n|t|e<U+026A>}}; 21 April 1816&nbsp;<U+2013> 31 March 1855) was an English novelist and poet, the eldest of the three [[Bront<U+00EB> family|Bront<U+00EB>]] sisters who survived into adulthood and whose novels have become classics of English literature. She published her best known novel, ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', under the pen name Currer Bell.

==Early life and education==
Charlotte was born in [[Thornton, West Yorkshire|Thornton]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], in 1816, the third of the six children of [[Maria Branwell|Maria]] (n<U+00E9>e Branwell) and [[Patrick Bront<U+00EB>]] (formerly surnamed Brunty or Prunty), an Irish [[Anglican]] clergyman. In 1820 her [[Bront<U+00EB>|family]] moved a few miles to the village of [[Haworth]], where her father had been appointed [[perpetual curate]] of St Michael and All Angels Church. Her mother died of cancer on 15 September 1821, leaving five daughters, Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte, [[Emily Bront<U+00EB>|Emily]] and [[Anne Bront<U+00EB>|Anne]] plus a son, [[Branwell Bront<U+00EB>|Branwell]], to be taken care of by her sister, [[Elizabeth Branwell]].

In August 1824 Patrick Bront<U+00EB> sent Charlotte, Emily, Maria and Elizabeth to the Clergy Daughters' School at [[Cowan Bridge]] in [[Lancashire]]. Charlotte maintained that the school's poor conditions permanently affected her health and physical development, and hastened the deaths of Maria (born 1814) and Elizabeth (born 1815), who both died of [[tuberculosis]] in June 1825. After the deaths of her older sisters her father removed Charlotte and Emily from the school.{{sfn|Fraser|2008|p=261}} Charlotte used the school as the basis for Lowood School in ''[[Jane Eyre]]''.

At home in [[Haworth Parsonage]] Charlotte acted as "the motherly friend and guardian of her younger sisters".<ref>{{cite book|last=Cousin|first=John|title=A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature|year=1910|publisher=E.P. Dutton & Co.}}</ref>  She and her surviving siblings&nbsp;<U+2014> Branwell, Emily and Anne&nbsp;<U+2013> created their own fictional worlds, and began chronicling the lives and struggles of the inhabitants of their imaginary kingdoms. Charlotte and Branwell wrote [[Lord Byron|Byronic]] stories about their jointly imagined country, Angria, and Emily and Anne wrote articles and poems about [[Gondal (fictional country)|Gondal]]. The sagas they created were elaborate and convoluted, and exist in incomplete manuscripts. They provided them with an obsessive interest during childhood and early adolescence, which prepared them for literary vocations in adulthood.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=5}}
[[File:Roe Head, Mirfield - geograph.org.uk - 55901.jpg|thumb|Roe Head School]]
Between 1831 and 1832 Charlotte continued her education at Roe Head in [[Mirfield]], where she met her lifelong friends and correspondents [[Ellen Nussey]] and Mary Taylor.{{sfn|Fraser|2008|p=261}} In 1833 she wrote a novella, ''The Green Dwarf'', using the name Wellesley. She returned to Roe Head as a teacher from 1835 to 1838.

In 1839 she took up the first of many positions as [[governess]] to families in [[Yorkshire]], a career she pursued until 1841. In particular, from May to July 1839 she was employed by the Sidgwick family at their summer residence, Stone Gappe, in Lothersdale, where one of her charges was John Benson Sidgwick (1835<U+2013>1927), an unruly child who on one occasion threw a Bible at Charlotte, an incident that may have been the inspiration for that part of the opening chapter of ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' in which John Reed throws a book at the young Jane.{{sfn|Phillips-Evans|2012|pp=260<U+2013>261}}

==Brussels==
[[File:Pensionnat Heger plaque.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque in Brussels]]
In 1842 Charlotte and Emily travelled to [[Brussels]] to enrol at the boarding school run by [[Constantin Heger]] (1809<U+2013>96) and his wife Claire Zo<U+00E9> Parent Heger (1804<U+2013>87). In return for board and tuition Charlotte taught English and Emily taught music. Their time at the school was cut short when their aunt Elizabeth Branwell, who had joined the family in Haworth to look after the children after their mother's death, died of internal obstruction in October 1842. Charlotte returned alone to Brussels in January 1843 to take up a teaching post at the school. Her second stay was not happy: she was homesick and deeply attached to Constantin Heger. She returned to Haworth in January 1844 and used the time spent in Brussels as the inspiration for some of the events in ''[[The Professor (novel)|The Professor]]'' and ''[[Villette (novel)|Villette]]''.

==First publication==
In May 1846 Charlotte, Emily and Anne self-financed the publication of a joint collection of poems under their assumed names Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. The pseudonyms veiled the sisters' gender while preserving their initials; thus Charlotte was Currer Bell. "Bell" was the middle name of Haworth's curate, [[Arthur Bell Nicholls]], whom Charlotte later married. Of the decision to use ''noms de plume'', Charlotte wrote:
{{quote| Averse to personal publicity, we veiled our own names under those of Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell; the ambiguous choice being dictated by a sort of conscientious scruple at assuming Christian names positively masculine, while we did not like to declare ourselves women, because&nbsp;<U+2014> without at that time suspecting that our mode of writing and thinking was not what is called "feminine"&nbsp;<U+2013> we had a vague impression that authoresses are liable to be looked on with prejudice; we had noticed how critics sometimes use for their chastisement the weapon of personality, and for their reward, a flattery, which is not true praise.<ref>"Biographical Notice of Ellis And Acton Bell", from the preface to the 1910 edition of ''Wuthering Heights''.</ref>}}
Although only two copies of the collection of poems were sold, the sisters continued writing for publication and began their first novels, continuing to use their ''noms de plume'' when sending manuscripts to potential publishers.

==''Jane Eyre''==
{{main|Jane Eyre}}
[[File:Jane Eyre title page.jpg|thumb|Title page of the first edition of ''[[Jane Eyre]]'']]
Charlotte's first manuscript, ''The Professor'', did not secure a publisher, although she was heartened by an encouraging response from Smith, Elder & Co. of Cornhill, who expressed an interest in any longer works Currer Bell might wish to send.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=14}} Charlotte responded by finishing and sending a second manuscript in August 1847. Six weeks later ''Jane Eyre: An Autobiography'' was published. It tells the story of a plain governess, Jane, who, after difficulties in her early life, falls in love with her employer, Mr Rochester. They marry, but only after Rochester's insane first wife, of whom Jane initially has no knowledge, dies in a dramatic house fire. The book's style was innovative, combining [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] with gothic [[melodrama]], and broke new ground in being written from an intensely evoked first-person female perspective.{{sfn|Miller|2002|pp=12<U+2013>13}} Charlotte believed art was most convincing when based on personal experience; in ''Jane Eyre'' she transformed the experience into a novel with universal appeal.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=13}}

''Jane Eyre'' had immediate commercial success and initially received favourable reviews. [[George Henry Lewes|G. H. Lewes]] wrote that it was "an utterance from the depths of a struggling, suffering, much-enduring spirit," and declared that it consisted of "''suspiria de profundis''!" (sighs from the depths).{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=13}}Speculation about the identity and gender of the mysterious Currer Bell heightened with the publication  of ''Wuthering Heights'' by Ellis Bell (Emily)  and ''Agnes Grey'' by Acton Bell (Anne).{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=15}} Accompanying the speculation was a change in the critical reaction to Charlotte's work, as accusations were made that the writing was "coarse",{{sfn|Fraser|2008|p=24}} a judgement more readily made once it was suspected that Currer Bell was a woman.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=17}} However, sales of ''Jane Eyre'' continued to be strong and may even have increased as a result of the novel developing a reputation as an "improper" book.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=North American Review |date=October 1848}}, cited in {{cite book |title=The Bront<U+00EB>s: The Critical Heritage |editor-last=Allott |editor-first=M |publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul |year=1974}} cited in {{harvnb|Miller|2002|p=18}}.</ref>

==''Shirley'' and bereavements==
In 1848 Charlotte began work on the manuscript of her second novel, [[Shirley (novel)|''Shirley'']]. It was only partially completed when the Bront<U+00EB> family suffered the deaths of three of its members within eight months. In September 1848 Branwell died of [[chronic bronchitis]] and [[marasmus]], exacerbated by heavy drinking, although Charlotte believed that his death was due to [[tuberculosis]]. Branwell was also a suspected "[[opium]] eater"; a [[laudanum]] addict. Emily became seriously ill shortly after Branwell's funeral and died of pulmonary tuberculosis in December 1848. Anne died of the same disease in May 1849. Charlotte was unable to write at this time.

After Anne's death Charlotte resumed writing as a way of dealing with her grief,<ref>Letter from Charlotte to her publisher, 25 June 1849, from {{cite book |title=The Letters of Charlotte Bront<U+00EB>: Volume Two, 1848 <U+2013> 1851 |editor-last=Smith |editor-first=M |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1995}} cited in {{harvnb|Miller|2002|p=19}}</ref> and ''Shirley'', which deals with themes of industrial unrest and the role of women in society, was published in October 1849. Unlike ''Jane Eyre'', which is written in the first person, ''Shirley'' is written in the third person and lacks the emotional immediacy of her first novel,{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=19}} and reviewers found it less shocking.

==In society==
In view of the success of her novels, particularly ''Jane Eyre'', Charlotte was persuaded by her publisher to make occasional visits to London, where she revealed her true identity and began to move in more exalted social circles, becoming friends with [[Harriet Martineau]] and [[Elizabeth Gaskell]], and acquainted with [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] and G.H. Lewes. She never left Haworth for more than a few weeks at a time, as she did not want to leave her ageing father. Thackeray<U+2019>s daughter, writer [[Anne Isabella Thackeray Ritchie]], recalled a visit to her father by Charlotte:
[[File:CBRichmond.png|thumb|Portrait by [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]]]]
{{quote|... two gentlemen come in, leading a tiny, delicate, serious, little lady, with fair straight hair and steady eyes. She may be a little over thirty; she is dressed in a little ''bar<U+00E8>ge'' dress with a pattern of faint green moss. She enters in mittens, in silence, in seriousness; our hearts are beating with wild excitement. This then is the authoress, the unknown power whose books have set all London talking, reading, speculating; some people even say our father wrote the books&nbsp;<U+2013> the wonderful books. ...  The moment is so breathless that dinner comes as a relief to the solemnity of the occasion, and we all smile as my father stoops to offer his arm; for, genius though she may be, Miss Bront<U+00EB> can barely reach his elbow. My own personal impressions are that she is somewhat grave and stern, specially to forward little girls who wish to chatter. ...  Everyone waited for the brilliant conversation which never began at all. Miss Bront<U+00EB> retired to the sofa in the study, and murmured a low word now and then to our kind governess ... the conversation grew dimmer and more dim, the ladies sat round still expectant, my father was too much perturbed by the gloom and the silence to be able to cope with it at all ... after Miss Bront<U+00EB> had left, I was surprised to see my father opening the front door with his hat on. He put his fingers to his lips, walked out into the darkness, and shut the door quietly behind him ... long afterwards ... Mrs Procter asked me if I knew what had happened. ... It was one of the dullest evenings [Mrs Procter] had ever spent in her life ... the ladies who had all come expecting so much delightful conversation, and the gloom and the constraint, and how finally, overwhelmed by the situation, my father had quietly left the room, left the house, and gone off to his club.<ref>Anne Isabella Thackeray Ritchie. Chapters from Some Memoirs. cited in Sutherland, James (ed.) ''The Oxford Book of Literary Anecdotes''. OUP, 1975. ISBN 0-19-812139-3.</ref>}}
Charlotte's friendship with Elizabeth Gaskell, while not particularly close, was significant in that Gaskell wrote the first biography of Charlotte after her death in 1855.

==''Villette''==
Charlotte's third novel, the last published in her lifetime, was ''[[Villette (novel)|Villette]]'', which appeared in 1853. Its main themes include isolation, how such a condition can be borne,<ref>Reid Banks, L., ''Path to the Silent Country'', Penguin, 1977, p113</ref> and the internal conflict brought about by social repression of individual desire.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=47}} Its main character, Lucy Snowe, travels abroad to teach in a boarding school in the fictional town of Villette, where she encounters a culture and religion different from her own, and falls in love with a man (Paul Emanuel) whom she cannot marry. Her experiences result in a breakdown but eventually she achieves independence and fulfilment through running her own school. ''Villette'' marked Charlotte's return to writing from a first-person perspective (that of Lucy Snowe); the technique she had used in ''Jane Eyre''. Another similarity to ''Jane Eyre'' lies in the use of aspects of her own life as inspiration for fictional events;{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=47}} in particular her reworking of the time she spent at the ''pensionnat'' in Brussels. ''Villette'' was acknowledged by critics of the day as a potent and sophisticated piece of writing although it was criticised for "coarseness" and for not being suitably "feminine" in its portrayal of Lucy's desires.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=52}}

==Marriage==
Before the publication of ''Villette'' Charlotte received a proposal of marriage from [[Arthur Bell Nicholls]], her father's [[curate]], who had long been in love with her. She initially turned down his proposal and her father objected to the union at least partly because of Nicholls's poor financial status.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=54}} Elizabeth Gaskell, who believed that marriage provided "clear and defined duties" that were beneficial for a woman,{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=54}} encouraged Charlotte to consider the positive aspects of such a union and tried to use her contacts to engineer an improvement in Nicholls's finances.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=54}} Charlotte meanwhile was increasingly attracted to Nicholls and by January 1854 she had accepted his proposal. They gained the approval of her father by April and married in June.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=55}} They took their honeymoon in Kilkee, County Clare, Ireland.

==Death==
Charlotte became pregnant soon after her wedding, but her health declined rapidly and, according to Gaskell, she was attacked by "sensations of perpetual nausea and ever-recurring faintness".<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2007/LIVING/worklife/09/25/mf.plot.twists/ | title = Real life plot twists of famous authors | publisher=CNN | date = 25 September 2007|accessdate=12 June 2013}}
</ref> She died, with her unborn child, on 31 March 1855, aged 38. Her death certificate gives the cause of death as [[tuberculosis|phthisis]], but many biographers{{who|date=February 2012}} suggest that she died from dehydration and malnourishment due to vomiting caused by severe [[morning sickness]] or [[hyperemesis gravidarum]]. There is also evidence that she died from [[typhus]], which she may have caught from Tabitha Ackroyd, the Bront<U+00EB> household's oldest servant, who died shortly before her.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Charlotte was interred in the family vault in the Church of St Michael and All Angels at Haworth.

''The Professor'', the first novel Charlotte had written, was published posthumously in 1857. The fragment of a new novel she had been writing in her last years has been twice completed by recent authors, the more famous version being ''[[Emma Brown]]: A Novel from the Unfinished Manuscript by Charlotte Bront<U+00EB>'' by [[Clare Boylan]] in 2003. Most of her writings about the imaginary country Angria have also been published since her death.

==''The Life of Charlotte Bront<U+00EB>''==
[[File:CharlotteBrontePortrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait by J. H. Thompson at the Bronte Parsonage Museum]]
Elizabeth Gaskell's biography ''[[The Life of Charlotte Bront<U+00EB>]]'' was published in 1857. It was an important step for a leading female novelist to write a biography of another,{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=57}} and Gaskell's approach was unusual in that, rather than analysing her subject's achievements, she concentrated on private details of Charlotte's life, emphasising those aspects that countered the accusations of "coarseness" that had been levelled at her writing.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=57}} The biography is frank in places, but omits details of Charlotte's love for Heger, a married man, as being too much of an affront to contemporary morals and a likely source of distress to Charlotte's father, widower and friends.{{sfn|Lane|1953|pp= 178<U+2013>83}} Mrs Gaskell also provided doubtful and inaccurate information about Patrick Bront<U+00EB>, claiming that he did not allow his children to eat meat. This is refuted by one of Emily Bront<U+00EB>'s diary papers, in which she describes preparing meat and potatoes for dinner at the parsonage.<ref>[[Juliet Barker]], ''The Bront<U+00EB>s''</ref> It has been argued that Gaskell's approach transferred the focus of attention away from the 'difficult' novels, not just Charlotte's, but all the sisters', and began a process of sanctification of their private lives.{{sfn|Miller|2002|pp=57<U+2013>58}}

==Heger letters==
On 29 July 1913 ''The Times'' of London printed four letters Charlotte had written to Constantin Heger after leaving Brussels in 1844.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=109}} Written in French except for one postscript in English, the letters broke the prevailing image of Charlotte as an angelic martyr to Christian and female duties that had been constructed by many biographers, beginning with Gaskell.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=109}} The letters, which formed part of a larger and somewhat one-sided correspondence in which Heger frequently appears not to have replied, reveal that she had been in love with a married man, although they are complex and have been interpreted in numerous ways, including as an example of literary self-dramatisation and an expression of gratitude from a former pupil.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=109}}

''The Green Dwarf, A Tale of the Perfect Tense'' was written in 1833 under the pseudonym Lord Charles Albert Florian Wellesley. It shows the influence of [[Walter Scott]], and Charlotte's modifications to her earlier gothic style have led Christine Alexander to comment that, in the work, "it is clear that Bront<U+00EB> was becoming tired of the gothic mode ''per se''".{{sfn|Alexander|1993|pp=430<U+2013>432}}
