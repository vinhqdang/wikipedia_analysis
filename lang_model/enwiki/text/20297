'''Aaliyah Dana Haughton''' (January 16, 1979 <U+2013> August 25, 2001), who performed under the mononym '''Aaliyah''' ({{IPAc-en|a:|<U+02C8>|l|i<U+02D0>|<U+0259>}}), was an American recording artist, dancer, actress, and model. She was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York, and  raised in [[Detroit]], Michigan. At the age of 10, she appeared on the television show ''[[Star Search]]'' and performed in concert alongside [[Gladys Knight]]. At age 12, Aaliyah signed with [[Jive Records]] and her uncle [[Barry Hankerson]]'s [[Blackground Records]]. Hankerson introduced her to [[R. Kelly]], who became her mentor, as well as lead songwriter and producer of her debut album, ''[[Age Ain't Nothing but a Number]]''. The album sold three million copies in the United States and was certified double platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). After facing allegations of an illegal marriage with [[R. Kelly]], Aaliyah ended her contract with Jive and signed with [[Atlantic Records]].

Aaliyah worked with record producers [[Timbaland]] and [[Missy Elliott]] for her second album,  ''[[One in a Million (Aaliyah album)|One in a Million]]''; it sold 3.7 million copies in the United States and over eight million copies worldwide. In 2000, Aaliyah appeared in her first major film, ''[[Romeo Must Die]]''. She contributed to the film's soundtrack, which spawned the single "[[Try Again (Aaliyah song)|Try Again]]". The song topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] solely on [[airplay]], making Aaliyah the first artist in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' history to achieve this feat. "Try Again" earned Aaliyah a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for Best Female R&B Vocalist. After completing ''Romeo Must Die'', Aaliyah filmed her part in ''[[Queen of the Damned (film)|Queen of the Damned]]''. She released her third and final album, ''[[Aaliyah (album)|Aaliyah]]'', in July 2001.

On August 25, 2001, Aaliyah and eight others were killed in a plane crash in [[The Bahamas]] after filming the music video for the single "[[Rock the Boat (Aaliyah song)|Rock the Boat]]". The [[aviator|pilot]], Luis Morales III, was unlicensed at the time of the accident and had traces of [[cocaine]] and alcohol in his system. Aaliyah's family later filed a [[wrongful death claim|wrongful death]] lawsuit against [[Blackhawk International Airways]], which was settled out of court. Aaliyah's music has continued to achieve commercial success with several posthumous releases. Aaliyah sold 52 million records worldwide. She has been credited for helping redefine [[contemporary R&B]] and [[hip hop music|hip hop]], earning her the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|nicknames]] "Princess of R&B" and "Queen of Urban Pop". She is listed by ''Billboard'' as the tenth most successful female R&B artist of the past 25 years, and 27th most successful R&B artist in history.
