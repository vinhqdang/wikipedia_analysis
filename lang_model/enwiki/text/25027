'''Mauthausen''' (which was known from the summer of [[1940]] onward as '''Mauthausen-Gusen'''; {{lang-de|Konzentrationslager Mauthausen-Gusen}}) grew to become a large group of [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]]s that were built around the villages of [[Mauthausen]] and [[Gusen]] in [[Upper Austria]] (roughly 20 kilometres east of the city of [[Linz]]). 

Though initially it consisted of a single camp at Mauthausen, with time it was expanded to become one of the largest [[labour camp]] complexes in German-occupied Europe<ref name="Dobosiewicz_W_obronie">{{pl icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Stanis<U+0142>aw Dobosiewicz]] | title =Mauthausen-Gusen; w obronie <U+017C>ycia i ludzkiej godno<U+015B>ci | year =2000 | pages =191-202 | publisher =Bellona | location =Warsaw | id =ISBN 8311090483 }}</ref><ref name="Bischof">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Gunter Bischof]] | coauthors =[[Anton Pelinka]] | title =Austrian Historical Memory and National Identity | year =1996 | pages =185-190 | publisher =Transaction Publishers | location = | id =ISBN 1560009020| url =http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN1560009020&id=75l45XlpXTsC&pg=PA185&lpg=PA185&dq=Mauthausen&sig=bkPrYRhv5wuk1RG9fcmO-p6kYnU }}</ref>. Apart from the four main sub-camps at Mauthausen and nearby Gusen, more than 50 sub-camps of the camp complex, located in all parts of Austria and southern Germany used the inmates as [[slave labour]]. Several [[List of subcamps of Mauthausen|subordinate camps of the KZ Mauthausen]] complex included quarries, [[munition]]s factories, mines, arms factories and [[Messerschmitt Me 262|Me 262]] fighter-plane assembly plants.

In January of [[1945]], the camps <U+2014> directed from the central office in Mauthausen <U+2014> had a total of roughly 85,000 inmates<ref name="Dobosiewicz">{{pl icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Stanis<U+0142>aw Dobosiewicz]] | title =Mauthausen/Gusen; ob<U+00F3>z zag<U+0142>ady (Mauthausen/Gusen; the Camp of Doom) | year =1977 | pages =449 | publisher =Ministry of National Defence Press | location =Warsaw | id =ISBN 8311063680 }}</ref>. The [[#Death toll|death toll]] remains unknown, although most sources place it between 122,766 and 320,000 for the entire complex. The camps formed one of the first massive concentration camp complexes in Nazi Germany, and were the last ones to be liberated by [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]]. The two main camps - Mauthausen and Gusen I - were also the only two camps in the whole of Europe to be labelled as "Grade III" camps <U+2014> meaning that they were intended to be the toughest camps for the "Incorrigible Political Enemies of the [[Reich]]"<ref name="Dobosiewicz_W_obronie"/>.

==History==
=== KZ Mauthausen ===

On [[August 8]], [[1938]], prisoners from [[Dachau concentration camp]] were sent to the town of Mauthausen near [[Linz]], [[Austria]], to begin the construction of a new camp. The location was chosen due to its proximity to the transport-hub of Linz, but also because the area was sparsely-populated<ref name="Dobosiewicz"/>. Although the camp was <U+2014> from the beginning of its existence <U+2014> controlled by the German state, it was founded by a private company as an economic enterprise. The owner of the Wiener-Graben quarry (the Marbacher-Bruch, and Bettelberg quarries) which were located in, and around, Mauthausen <U+2014> was the [[DEST]] Company; an acronym for ''Deutsche Erd- und Steinwerke Gmbh''. The company, led by [[Oswald Pohl]] - who was also a high-ranking official of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] - bought the quarries from the city of [[Vienna]] and started the construction of the Mauthausen camp. A year later, the company ordered the construction of the first camp at Gusen. The [[granite]] mined in the quarries had previously been used to pave the streets of Vienna, but the Nazi authorities envisioned a complete reconstruction of major German towns in accordance with the plans of [[Albert Speer]] and other architects of [[Nazi architecture]]<ref name=Speer">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Albert Speer]] | title =Inside The Third Reich | year =1970 | publisher =The Macmillan Company | location =New York | id =ISBN 70119132 }}</ref>, for which large quantities of granite were needed.

The money needed for the construction of the Mauthausen camp was gathered from a variety of sources, including: 
Commercial loans from [[Dresdner Bank]] and [[Prague]]-based [[Escompte Bank]], the so-called [[Reinhardt's fund]] (meaning money stolen from the inmates of the concentration camps themselves) and from the [[German Red Cross]]<ref name="Dobosiewicz"/><ref name="Red Cross">Oswald Pohl, apart from being a high-ranking SS member, owner of DEST and several other companies, chief of administration and treasurer of various Nazi organizations, was also the managing director of the German Red Cross. In 1938, he transferred 8,000,000 RM from member-fees to one of the accounts of the SS (SS-Spargemeinschaft e.V.), which in turn donated all the money to DEST in 1939.</ref>.

Mauthausen initially served as a strictly-run prison camp for common criminals, prostitutes<ref name="<U+017B>eromski">{{pl icon}} {{cite book | author =Tadeusz <U+017B>eromski | title =Mi<U+0119>dzynarod<U+00F3>wka strace<U+0144>c<U+00F3>w | year =1983 | pages = 76+| publisher =Ksi<U+0105><U+017C>ka i Wiedza | location =Warsaw | id =ISBN 830511175X }}</ref> and other categories of "Incorrigible Law Offenders"<ref name="Heydrich">As stated in [[Reinhard Heydrich]]'s memo of [[January 1]], [[1941]]; in: Dobosiewicz, Stanis<U+0142>aw, op.cit., p.12</ref>. On [[May 8]], [[1939]] it was converted to a labour camp which was mainly used for the incarceration of political prisoners<ref name="Marsalek">{{de icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Hans Mar<U+0161><U+00E1>lek]] | title =Die Geschichte des Konzentrationslagers Mauthausen (History of Mauthausen Concentration Camp) | year =1995 | publisher =<U+00D6>sterreichischen Lagergemeinschaft Mauthausen u.

===KL Gusen===
[[Image:GusenII aerial.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Aerial view of the Gusen II camp]]
In late 1939, the Mauthausen camp, with its Wiener-Graben quarry, that supplied [[granite]] was already overcrowded with prisoners. Their numbers rose from 1,080 in late 1938, to over 3,000 a year later. About that time the construction of a new camp in [[Gusen]] <U+2014> about 4.5 kilometres away <U+2014> was started. The new camp (later named '''Gusen I'''), and its Kastenhofen quarry, was completed in May of 1940. The first inmates were put in the first two huts (No. 7 and 8) on [[April 17]] [[1940]], while the first transport of prisoners - mostly from the camps in [[Dachau]] and [[Sachsenhausen]] - arrived on [[May 25]] of the same year<ref name="Dobosiewicz"/>. 

Like nearby Mauthausen, the Gusen camp also used its inmates as slave labour in the granite quarries, but they also rented them out to various local businesses. In October of 1941, several huts were separated from the Gusen sub-camp by [[barbed wire]] and turned into a separate ''Prisoner of War Labour Camp'' ({{lang-de|Kriegsgefangenenarbeitslager}}), where a large number of [[prisoners of war]] <U+2014> mostly Soviet officers <U+2014> were imprisoned. By 1942, the production capacity of both Mauthausen and Gusen had reached its peak. Gusen was expanded to include the central depot of the [[SS]], where various goods which had been stolen from occupied territories were sorted and then dispatched to Germany<ref name="Dobosiewicz2">Dobosiewicz, op.cit., p.26</ref>. Local quarries and businesses were in constant need of a new source of labour as more and more Germans were drafted into the [[Wehrmacht]]. 

In March of 1944, the former SS depot was converted to a new sub-camp, and was named '''Gusen II'''. Until the end of the war the depot served as an improvised concentration camp, which contained from 12,000 to 17,000 inmates, who were deprived of even the most basic facilities<ref name="Dobosiewicz_W_obronie"/>. In December of 1944, yet another part of Gusen was opened in nearby [[Lungitz]], where parts of the factory infrastructure were converted into the third sub-camp of Gusen <U+2014> '''Gusen III'''<ref name="Dobosiewicz_W_obronie"/>. The rise in the number of sub-camps could not catch up with the rising number of inmates, which led to tragic overcrowding of the huts in all of the sub-camps of Mauthausen-Gusen. In late 1940, there were roughly 2 inmates per bed, but in 1944, the number rose to 4 per bed<ref name="Dobosiewicz_W_obronie"/>.

=== Mauthausen-Gusen camp system ===
[[Image:Austria Mauthausen sub-camps.png|thumb|right|250px|Map showing location of some of the most notable [[List of Mauthausen sub-camps|sub-camps of Mauthausen-Gusen]]]]
{{seealso|List of subcamps of Mauthausen}}
As the production in all of the sub-camps of Mauthausen-Gusen complex was constantly rising, so was the number of prisoners and the number of the sub-camps themselves. Although initially the camps of Gusen and Mauthausen mostly served the local quarries, from 1942, and onwards, they began to be included into the German [[war machine]]. To accommodate the ever-increasing number of slave workers, additional sub-camps ({{lang-de|Au<U+00DF>enlager}}) of Mauthausen were started to be built in all parts of Austria. At the end of the war the list included 101 camps (including 49 major sub-camps<ref name="Waller">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =[[James Waller]] | title =Becoming Evil: How Ordinary People Commit Genocide and Mass Killing | year =2002 | pages =3-5 | publisher =[[Oxford University Press]] | location =Oxford | id =ISBN 0195148681| url =http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN0195148681&id=dHBB4TJpcx0C&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4&dq=Mauthausen&sig=40Bj2HNIG1t24SjCpEIzLNHJzdE }}</ref>) which covered most of modern [[Austria]], from [[Mittersill]] south of [[Salzburg]] to [[Schwechat]] west of [[Vienna]] and from [[Passau]] on the pre-war Austro-German border to the [[Loibl Pass]] on the border with [[Yugoslavia]]. The sub-camps were divided onto several categories, depending on their main function: ''Produktionslager'' for factory workers, ''Baulager'' for construction, ''Aufr<U+00E4>umlager'' for cleaning the rubble in Allied-bombed towns and ''Kleinlager'' (small camps) where the inmates were working specifically for the SS. 

===Mauthausen-Gusen as a business enterprise===
The production output of Mauthausen-Gusen exceeded that of each of the five other large slave labour centres, including: [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]], [[Flossenb<U+00FC>rg concentration camp|Flossenb<U+00FC>rg]], [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp|Gross-Rosen]], [[Marburg]] and [[Natzweiler-Struthof]], in terms of both production quota and profits<ref name="Memoriales">{{es icon}} {{cite book | author =various authors | title =Memoriales hist<U+00F3>ricos, 1933-1945 | year =2005 | chapter = Historia de los campos de concentraci<U+00F3>n: El sistema de campos de concentraci<U+00F3>n nacionalsocialista, 1933-1945: un modelo europeo | url =http://www.memoriales.net/ }}</ref>. The list of companies using slave labour from the Mauthausen-Gusen camp system was long, and included both national corporations and small, local firms and communities. Some parts of the quarries were converted into a [[Mauser]] [[machine pistol]] assembly plant. In 1943, an underground factory for the [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]] company was built in Gusen. A similar factory for the [[Messerschmitt]] aeroplane-producer was opened near the village of [[Sankt Georgen an der Gusen|St. Georgen]]. Altogether, 45 larger companies took part in making [[Konzentrationslager|KZ]] Mauthausen-Gusen one of the most profitable concentration camps of Nazi Germany, with more than 11,000,000 [[Reichsmark]]<ref name="Reichsmark">11,000,000 Reichsmark was equivalent to roughly 4,403,000 [[US dollar]]s or almost 1 million [[pound sterling|UK pounds]] by [[1939]] exchange rates; as per: {{en icon}} {{cite web | author=Micha<U+0142> Derela | title=The prices of Polish armament before 1939 | publisher= | year=2005 | work=The PIBWL military site | url=http://derela.republika.pl/prices.htm | accessdate=2006-05-22 }}.

Prisoners were also <U+00B4>rented-out<U+00B4> as slave-labour, and were exploited in various ways, such as working for local farms, for road construction, reinforcing and repairing the banks of the Danube, and the construction of large residential areas in Sankt Georgen as well as being forced to excavate archaeological sites in Spielberg.

When the Allied [[strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing campaign]] started to target the German war industry, German planners decided to move production to underground facilities that were impenetrable to enemy aerial bombardment. In Gusen I the prisoners were ordered to build several large tunnels beneath the hills surrounding the camp (code-named ''Kellerbau''). By the end of [[World War II]] the prisoners had dug 29,400 m<U+00B2> to house a small arms factory. After 1944, similar tunnels were also built beneath the village of Sankt Georgen by the inmates of Gusen II sub-camp (code-named ''Bergkristall''). They dug roughly 50,000 m<U+00B2> so the Messerschmitt company could build an assembly plant to produce the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] and [[V-2 rocket]]s. In addition to planes, some 7,000 m<U+00B2> of Gusen II tunnels served as factories for various war materials<ref name="Bergkristall">{{en icon}} {{cite web | author=Rudolf Haunschmied, Harald Faeth | title=B8 "BERGKRISTALL" (KL Gusen II) | publisher= | year=1997 | work=Tunnel and Shelter Researching | url=http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/1325/berg.htm | accessdate=2006-04-26 }}</ref>. In late 1944, roughly 11,000 of the Gusen I and II inmates were working in underground facilities<ref name="Dobosiewicz-tunnels">Stanis<U+0142>aw Dobosiewicz, ''W obronie <U+017C>ycia...'', op.cit., p.194</ref>. An additional 6,500 worked on expanding the underground network of tunnels and halls. In 1945, the Me 262 works was already finished and they were able to assemble 1,250 planes a month. This was the second largest plane factory in Germany after the [[Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp]], which was also underground<ref name="Dobosiewicz-tunnels"/>.

=== Extermination through labour ===

The political function of the camp continued in parallel with its economic role. Until at least 1942, it was used for the imprisonment and murder of Germany's political, and ideological, enemies, both real and imagined<ref name="Bischof"/><ref name="Richardson">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Elizabeth Richardson]] | title =Administrative Law and Procedure | year =1995 | pages =162-164 | chapter =United States vs. Leprich | chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN0827374682&id=8iBCkpR1MqMC&pg=PA162&lpg=PA162&dq=Mauthausen&sig=uS5RYlmOR7sqvkU-C-Ff3Hgq_hU | publisher =Thomson Delmar Learning | id =ISBN 0827374682 }}</ref>. The camp served the needs of the German war machine and also carried out [[Vernichtung durch Arbeit|exterminations through labour]]. When the inmates were totally exhausted - after having worked in the quarries for 12 hours a day, or if they were too ill, or too weak to work - they were then transferred to the [[Revier]] ("Krankenrevier", sick barrack) or other places for extermination. Initially, the camp did not have a [[gas chamber]] of its own and the so-called [[Muzulman]]s, or prisoners who were too sick to work, after being maltreated, under-nourished or totally exhausted, were then transferred to other concentration camps for extermination (mostly to the infamous [[Hartheim Castle]]<ref name="Traveler's Guide">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Marc Terrance]] | title =Concentration Camps: A Traveler's Guide to World War II Sites | year =1999 | publisher =Universal Publishers | location = | id =ISBN 1581128398| url =http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN1581128398&id=TNt9IVBVeNQC&pg=PA142&lpg=PA142&dq=Mauthausen&vq=Mauthausen&sig=LICy2j9fVQHMJS7anXJDGm7tTDs }}</ref>), which was 40.7 km (25.3 miles) away, or killed by lethal injection and cremated in the local [[crematorium]]. The growing number of prisoners made the system too expensive and from 1940, Mauthausen was one of the few camps in the West to use a gas chamber on a regular basis. In the beginning, an improvised [[mobile gas chamber]] - a van with the exhaust pipe connected to the inside - shuttled between [[Mauthausen]] and [[Gusen]]. By December of 1941, a permanent gas chamber that could supposedly kill about 120 prisoners at a time was completed<ref name="Abzug">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Robert Abzug]] | title =Inside the Vicious Heart | year =1987 | pages =106-110 | publisher =Oxford University Press | location =Oxford | id =ISBN 0195042360 | url =http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN0195042360&id=CMfGlx3jDLIC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107&dq=Mauthausen&sig=Gm0Bv_k8PLp4hFKnxl-9cVWlwk8 }}</ref><ref name="Shermer">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Michael Shermer]] | coauthors =[[Alex Grobman]] | title =Denying History: Who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and Why Do They Say It? | year =2002 | pages =168-175 | chapter =The Gas Chamber at Mauthausen | chapterurl =http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN0520234693&id=Q-0B9-D5Vz4C&pg=PA168&lpg=PA168&dq=Mauthausen&sig=CNT1pOFaaBiIbNkcYl1YWbDgOso | publisher =[[University of California]] Press | id =ISBN 0520234693 }}</ref>.

{{seealso|List of notable Mauthausen-Gusen inmates}}
Until early 1940, the largest group of inmates consisted of German, Austrian and Czechoslovak socialists, communists, [[anarchists]], homosexuals, and people of [[Roma people|Roma]] origin. Other groups of people to be persecuted solely on religious grounds were the ''Sectarians'', as they were dubbed by the Nazi regime; meaning [[Bible Students]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. The reason for their imprisonment was their total rejection of giving the loyalty oath to Hitler and their absolute refusal to participate in any kind of military service<ref name="Marsalek"/>. 

In early 1940, a large number of Poles were transferred to the Mauthausen-Gusen complex. The first groups were mostly composed of artists, scientists, [[Zwi<U+0105>zek Harcerstwa Polskiego|Boy Scouts]], teachers, and university professors<ref name="Dobosiewicz"/><ref name="Nogaj">{{pl icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Stanis<U+0142>aw Nogaj]] | coauthors = | title =Gusen; Pami<U+0119>tnik dziennikarza (Gusen: Memories of a Journalist) | year =1945 | pages =64 | publisher =Komitet by<U+0142>ych wi<U+0119><U+017A>ni<U+00F3>w obozu koncentracyjnego Gusen | location =Katowice-Chorz<U+00F3>w }}</ref>, who were arrested during the course of the [[AB Action]].

Later in the war all new arrivals were from every category of the "unwanted", but educated people, and so-called political prisoners constituted the largest part of all inmates until the end of the war. During [[World War II]], large groups of [[Spanish Civil War|Spanish Republicans]] were also transferred to Mauthausen and its sub-camps. Most of them were former Republican soldiers or activists who had fled to France after [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s victory and then were captured by German forces after the [[Battle of France|French defeat]] in 1940 or handed over to the Germans by the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] authorities. The largest of these groups arrived at Gusen in January of 1941<ref name="Wnuk">{{pl icon}} {{cite book | author =W<U+0142>odzimierz Wnuk | title =By<U+0142>em z wami (I Were With You) | year =1972 | pages =100-105 | chapter =Z Hiszpanami w jednym szeregu (With the Spaniards in One Line) | publisher =[[PAX]] | location =Warsaw }}</ref>. In early 1941, almost all the Poles and Spaniards, except for a small group of specialists working in the quarry's stone mill, were transferred from Mauthausen to Gusen<ref name="Grzesiuk">{{pl icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Stanis<U+0142>aw Grzesiuk]] | title =Pi<U+0119><U+0107> lat kacetu (Five Years of KZ) | year =1985 | pages =392 | publisher =Ksi<U+0105><U+017C>ka i Wiedza | location =Warsaw | id =ISBN 8305111083 }}</ref>. Following the outbreak of the [[Operation Barbarossa|Soviet-German War]] in 1941 the camps started to receive a large number of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[prisoners of war|POW]]s. Most of them were kept in huts separated from the rest of the camp. The Soviet prisoners of war were a major part of the first groups to be gassed in the newly-built gas chamber in early 1942. In 1944, a large group of [[Hungary|Hungarian]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Jews was also transferred to the camp<ref name="Hungarian Jews">Roughly 8,000 people altogether</ref>. Much like all the other large groups of prisoners that were transferred to Mauthausen-Gusen, most of them either died as a result of the hard labour and poor conditions, or were thrown down the sides of the Mauthausen quarry (nick-named the ''Parachutists<U+00B4> Wall'' by the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] guards and [[Kapos]]). This name was a sick joke because it made fun of the prisoners by calling them "Parachutists without a parachute". 

Throughout the years of World War II, the camps of Mauthausen-Gusen received new prisoners in smaller transports on a daily basis; mostly from other concentration camps in German-occupied Europe. Most of the prisoners in the sub-camps of Mauthausen were kept in various detention sites prior to transportation to their final destination. The most notable of such centres for Mauthausen-Gusen were the infamous camps at [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] and [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. The first transports from Auschwitz arrived in February of 1942. The second transport in June of that year was much larger and numbered some 1,200 prisoners. Similar groups were sent from Auschwitz to Gusen and Mauthausen in April and November of 1943, and then in January and February of 1944. Finally, after [[Adolf Eichmann]] visited Mauthausen in May of that year, KZ Mauthausen-Gusen received the first group of roughly 8,000 Hungarian Jews from Auschwitz; the first group to be evacuated from that camp before the Soviet advance. Initially, the groups evacuated from Auschwitz consisted of qualified workers for the ever-growing industry of the Mauthausen-Gusen camp complex, but as the evacuation proceeded other categories of people were also transported to Mauthausen, Gusen, Vienna or [[Melk]].

Over time Auschwitz had to almost stop accepting new prisoners and most were directed to Mauthausen instead. The last group - roughly 10,000 prisoners - was evacuated in the last wave in January of 1945, only a few weeks before the Soviet capture of the area of the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex<ref name="KARTA">{{pl icon}} {{cite web | author=Piotr Filipkowski  | title=Auschwitz w drodze do Matchausen (Auschwitz on its Way to Mauthausen) | year=2005 | work=Europe According to Auschwitz | url=http://www.reporter.edu.pl/europa_wg_auschwitz/kronika_reportaz/konferencja_historia_mowiona_a_kronika_reportaz/auschwitz_w_drodze_do_matchausen | accessdate=2006-04-11 }}</ref>. Among them was a large group of civilians arrested by the Germans after the failure of the [[Warsaw Uprising]]<ref name="Kirchmayer">{{pl icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Jerzy Kirchmayer]] | title =Powstanie warszawskie | year =1978 | pages =576 | publisher =Ksi<U+0105><U+017C>ka i Wiedza | location =Warsaw | id =ISBN 830511080X }}</ref>, but by the liberation not more than 500 of them were still alive<ref name="Dobosiewicz-evacuation">Stanis<U+0142>aw Dobosiewicz, op.cit., pp.365-367</ref>. Altogether, during the final months of the war, 23,364 prisoners from other [[concentration camp]]s arrived at the camp complex<ref name="Dobosiewicz-evacuation"/>. Many more perished during [[death march]]es; where they dropped dead because of pure exhaustion, or in railway wagons, where the prisoners were confined at sub-zero temperatures - without adequate food or water - for several days prior to their arrival. Prisoner transports were considered to be less important than other important services. 

Many of those who survived the journey died before they could be registered, whilst others were given the camp numbers of prisoners who had already been killed<ref name="Dobosiewicz-evacuation"/>. Most were then accommodated in the camps or in the newly-established tent camp ({{lang-de|Zeltlager}}) just outside the Mauthausen sub-camp, where roughly 2000 people were forced into tents intended for not more than 800 inmates, and then starved to death<ref name="Freund">{{de icon}} {{cite web | author=Florian Freund, Harald Greifeneder | title=Zeltlager | publisher= | year=2005 | work= | url=http://www.mauthausen-memorial.at/db/admin/de/show_article.php?carticle=343&topopup=1 | accessdate=2006-05-16 }}</ref>. 

As in all other [[German concentration camps]], not all the prisoners were equal. Their treatment depended largely on the [[Nazi concentration camp badges|category assigned to each inmate]], as well as their nationality and rank within the system. The so-called [[Kapo (Arbeitslager)|kapo]]s, or prisoners who had been recruited by their captors to police their fellow prisoners, were given more food and higher pay in the form of concentration camp coupons which could be exchanged for cigarettes in the canteen, as well as a separate room inside most barracks. In addition, following [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]]'s order in June, 1941, a [[brothel]] was opened for them in 1942, in the Mauthausen and Gusen I camps<ref name="nizkor">{{cite web | author=KZ Gusen Memorial Committee | title=KZ Gusen I Concentration Camp

The Kapos formed the main part of the so-called ''Prominents'' ({{lang-de|Prominenz}}), or prisoners who were given a much better treatment than the average inmate.

====Women and children in Mauthausen-Gusen====

Although the Mauthausen-Gusen camp complex was mostly a labour camp for men, a women's camp was opened in Mauthausen, in September of 1944, with the first transport of female prisoners from [[Auschwitz]]. Eventually, more women and children came to Mauthausen from [[Ravensbruck]], [[Bergen Belsen]], [[Gross Rosen]], and [[Buchenwald]]. With them came some female guards. Twenty are known to have served in the Mauthausen camp, and sixty in the whole camp complex. Female guards also staffed the Mauthausen sub-camps at [[Hirtenberg]], [[Lenzing]] (the main women's sub-camp in Austria), and [[St. Lambrecht]]. The Chief Overseers at Mauthausen were firstly [[Margarete Freinberger]], and then [[Jane Bernigau]]. Of all the female Overseers who served in Mauthausen, almost all of them were recruited between September 1944, and November 1944, from Austrian cities and towns. In early April of 1945, at least 2,500 more female prisoners came from the female sub-camps at [[Amstetten (Lower Austria)|Amstetten]], St. Lambrecht, Hirtenberg, and the [[Flossenb<U+00FC>rg concentration camp|Flossenb<U+00FC>rg]] sub-camp at [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]]. It is rumoured that [[Hildegard Lachert]] also served at Mauthausen<ref name="Brown">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Daniel Patrick Brown]] | title =The Camp Women: The Female Auxiliaries Who Assisted the SS in Running the Nazi Concentration Camp System | year =2002 | pages =288 | publisher =Schiffer Publishing | location = | id =ISBN 0764314440 }}</ref>.

The number of imprisoned children increased 6.2 times, whereas the total number of adult prisoners during the same period multiplied by a factor of only four.

====The treatment of inmates and methodology of crime====

Although not the only concentration camp where the German authorities implemented their [[extermination through labour]] (''Vernichtung durch Arbeit''), Mauthausen-Gusen was one of the most brutal and severe. The conditions within the camp were considered exceptionally hard to bear, even by concentration camp standards<ref name="HolocaustMuseum">{{en icon}} {{cite web | author=Simon Wiesenthal Center | title=Selected Holocaust Glossary: Terms, Places and Personalities | publisher=Florida Holocaust Museum | work=Florida Holocaust Museum webpage | url=http://www.flholocaustmuseum.org/frameworks/glossary.htm | accessdate=2006-04-12 }}</ref><ref name="Bloxham">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Donald Bloxham]] | title =Genocide on Trial: War Crimes Trials and the Formation of Holocaust History and Memory | pages =210 | publisher =Oxford University Press | location =Oxford | id =ISBN 0199259046 | url =http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN0199259046&id=ab4ZL8h5dFMC&pg=PA210&lpg=PA210&dq=extermination+through+labour&vq=Mauthausen&sig=horhgVquFxTIFvA02FbZGzzi4x0 }}</ref><ref name="Burleigh">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Michael Burleigh]] | title =Ethics and Extermination: Reflections on Nazi Genocide | year =1997 | pages =210-211 | publisher =Cambridge University Press | location =Cambridge | id =ISBN 0521588162 | url =http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN0521588162&id=y-tbb8Yx3ooC&pg=RA1-PA211&lpg=RA1-PA211&dq=extermination+through+labour&vq=Mauthausen&sig=FF-Nujc2T9wvayl-lFdQ8hWaJPU }}</ref>. The inmates suffered not only from [[malnutrition]], overcrowded huts and constant abuse and beatings by the guards, and [[Kapo (Arbeitslager)|kapo]]s<ref name="Grzesiuk"/>, but also from exceptionally hard labour<ref name="Abzug"/>. As there were too many prisoners in Mauthausen to have all of them work in its quarry at the same time, many were put to work in workshops, or had to do other manual work, whilst the unfortunate ones who were selected to work in the quarry were only there because of their so-called "crimes" in the camp. The reasons for sending them to work in the "Punishment-Detail" were trivial, and included such crimes as not saluting a German passing by. 

The work in the quarries <U+2014> often in unbearable heat or in temperatures as low as minus 30 degrees [[Celsius]]<ref name="Grzesiuk"/> <U+2014> led to exceptionally-high mortality rates<ref name="Mortality"> It is often mentioned that the mortality rate reached 58% in 1941, as compared with 36% at Dachau, and 19% at Buchenwald over the same period. Dobosiewicz - who made the most extensive study - compared various factors: his estimations were based on the number of prisoners to arrive in a year as compared to the number of that were murdered during a year.</ref><ref name="Burleigh"/>. The food rations were limited, and during the 1940-1942 period, an average inmate weighed 40 kilograms<ref name="Pike">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =[[David Wingeate Pike]] | title =Spaniards in the Holocaust | year =2000 | pages =97 | publisher =Routledge | location =London | id =ISBN 0415227801 | url =http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN0415227801&id=-9uRoGlfSM8C&dq=Mauthausen-Gusen&lpg=PA95&pg=PA97&sig=C9TJL0A0o9nDqtl8-p_WxWgC128  }}</ref>. It is estimated that the average energy content of food rations dropped from about 1,750 calories a day during the 1940-1942 period, to between 1,150 and 1,460 during the next period. In 1945, the energy content was even lower and did not exceed 600 to 1,000 calories a day; that is less than a third of the energy needed by an average worker in [[heavy industry]]<ref name="Dobosiewicz_W_obronie"/>. This led to [[Muzulman|muzulmanisation]] and the starvation of thousands of inmates.

The inmates of Mauthausen, Gusen I, and Gusen II had access to a separate sub-camp for the sick <U+2014> the so-called ''Krankenlager''. Despite the fact that (roughly) 100 medics from among the inmates were working there<ref name="Krukowski">{{pl icon}} {{cite book | author =Stefan Krukowski | title =Nad pi<U+0119>knym modrym Dunajem; Mauthausen (Mauthausen: At the Blue Danube) | year =1966 | pages =292-297 | chapter =Pami<U+0119>ci lekarzy (Memory of the doctors) | publisher =Ksi<U+0105><U+017C>ka i Wiedza | location =Warsaw }}</ref>, they were not given any medication and could offer only basic first aid<ref name="Krukowski"/><ref name="Dobosiewicz"/>. Thus the ''hospital camp'' - as it was called by the German authorities - was, in fact, the last stop before death for thousands of inmates, and very few had a chance to recover.

[[Image:mauthausen-tablet.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A List of the dead]]

The rock-quarry in Mauthausen was at the base of the infamous "Stairs of Death". Prisoners were forced to carry roughly-hewn blocks of stone <U+2014> often weighing as much as 50 kilograms <U+2014> up the 186 stairs - one behind the other. As a result, many exhausted prisoners collapsed in front of the other prisoners in the line, and then fell on top of the other prisoners, creating a horrific [[domino]] effect; the first prisoner falling onto the next, and so on, all the way down the stairs<ref name="Weissman">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Gary Weissman]] | title =Fantasies of Witnessing: Postwar Efforts to Experience the Holocaust | year =2004 | pages =2-3 | publisher =[[Cornell University]] Press | id =ISBN 0801442532| url =http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN0801442532&id=kXO9wXvYuAQC&dq=Mauthausen&lpg=PA1&pg=PA3&sig=Mmr8_dvGaJIJqrcQJ6j2DJfcyEo }}</ref>.

Such brutality was not accidental. The SS guards would often force prisoners <U+2014> exhausted from hours of hard labour without sufficient food and water <U+2014> to race up the stairs carrying blocks of stone. Those who survived the ordeal would often be placed in a line-up at the edge of a cliff known as "The Parachute Wall" ({{lang-de|Fallschirmspringerwand}})<ref name="Mauthausen-memorial">{{de icon}} {{cite web| author=| coauthors =| url =http://www.mauthausen-memorial.at/db/admin/de/show_article.php?carticle=367&topopup=1| title =Fallschirmspringerwand| format =| work =Mauthausen Memorial| publisher =KZ-Gedenkstaette Mauthausen| accessdate =2006-05-16}}</ref>. At gun-point each prisoner would have the option of being shot, or to push the prisoner in front of them off of the cliff<ref name="Waller"/>. Other common methods of extermination of prisoners, who were either sick, unfit for further labour or as a means of [[Collective responsibility (doctrine)|collective responsibility]] or after escape attempts included:

* Being beaten to death (by the SS and Kapos)
* Icy showers - some 3,000 inmates died of [[hypothermia]] - after having being forced to take an icy cold shower - and who were then left outside in cold weather<ref name="Oskar<U+017C>amy">{{pl icon}} {{cite book | author =various authors | coauthors =W<U+0142>odzimierz Wnuk | title =Oskar<U+017C>amy!

After the war one of the survivors, Dr. [[Antoni Go<U+015B>ci<U+0144>ski]] reported 62 ways of murdering people in the camps of Gusen I and Mauthausen<ref name="Oskar<U+017C>amy"/>. Hans Mar<U+0161>alek estimated that an average [[life expectancy]] of newly-arrived prisoners in Gusen varied from 6 months between 1940 and 1942, to less than 3 months in early 1945<ref name="Marsalek2">Hans Mar<U+0161>alek (1968) ''Konzentrazionslager Gusen''. Vienna, p. 32; cited in: Dobosiewicz, op.cit., pp.192-193</ref>.

Paradoxically, with the growth of forced labour industry in various sub-camps of Mauthausen-Gusen, the situation of some of the prisoners improved significantly. While the food rations were increasingly limited every month, the heavy industry necessitated skilled specialists rather than unqualified workers and the brutality of the camp's SS and Kapos was limited. While the prisoners were still beaten on the daily basis and the [[Muzulman]]s were still exterminated, from early 1943 on some of the factory workers were allowed to receive food parcels from their families (mostly Poles and Frenchmen). This allowed many of them not only to evade the risk of starvation, but also to help other prisoners who had no relatives outside the camps <U+2014> or were not allowed to receive parcels<ref name="Grzesiuk_food">Stanis<U+0142>aw Grzesiuk, op.cit., pp. 252-255 and following</ref>.

==== Death toll ====

Because of the fact that the Germans had destroyed much of the camp files and evidence, as well as having often given newly-arrived prisoners the camp numbers of those who had already been killed<ref name="Abzug"/>, the exact death toll of the Mauthausen-Gusen complex is impossible to estimate. The matter is further complicated by the fact that some of the inmates of Gusen were murdered in Mauthausen, and at least 3,423 were sent to Hartheim Castle - some 40.7 km (25.3 miles) away - whilst several thousands were killed in mobile gas chambers <U+2014> without any mention of the exact number of victims in the surviving files<ref name="Dobosiewicz-Zamordowani">Stanis<U+0142>aw Dobosiewicz, op.cit., pp.418-426</ref>. The SS, before their escape from the camps on [[May 4]], [[1945]] tried to destroy the evidence and only approximately 40,000 victims were identified. During the first days after the liberation the camp's main chancellery was seized by the members of a Polish inmate resistance organization and secured against the wishes of other inmates, who wanted to burn it<ref name="Dobosiewicz-Samoobrona">{{pl icon}} {{cite book | author =Stanis<U+0142>aw Dobosiewicz | title =Mauthausen/Gusen; Samoobrona i konspiracja (Mauthausen/Gusen: self-defence and underground) | year =1980 | pages =486 | publisher =Wydawnictwa MON | location =Warsaw | id =ISBN 8311064970 }}</ref>.

The surviving camp archives include personal files of 37,411 murdered prisoners, including 22,092 Poles, 5,024 Spaniards, 2,843 Soviet prisoners of war and 7,452 inmates of 24 other nationalities<ref name="Wlaz<U+0142>owski">{{pl icon}} {{cite book | author =Zbigniew Wlaz<U+0142>owski | title =Przez kamienio<U+0142>omy i kolczasty drut (Through the Quarries and Barbed Wire) | year =1974 | pages =7-12 | publisher =Wydawnictwo Literackie | location =Krak<U+00F3>w }}</ref>.

# A report by [[J<U+00F3>zef <U+017B>mij]], a survivor who had been working in the Gusen I camp's chancellery. His report is based on personally-made copies of yearly reports from the period between 1940 and 1944, and the camps commander's daily reports for the period between January 1, 1945, and the day of the liberation. 
# Original death register for the sub-camp of Gusen held by the [[International Red Cross]]
# Personal notes of [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Nogaj]], another inmate who had been working in the chancellery of Gusen
# Death register prepared by the SS chief medic of the Mauthausen main chancellery for the sub-camps of Gusen (similar records for the Mauthausen sub-camp itself were destroyed)

Because of that the exact death toll of the entire Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp system varies considerably from source to source. Various scholars place it at between 122,766<ref name="tablet">As evidenced by [[:Image:Mauthausen-tablet.jpg|one of the stone tablets]] commemorating the victims, erected after the war by Austrian authorities.</ref> and 320,000<ref name="Oskar<U+017C>amy"/>, with other numbers also frequently quoted being 200,000<ref name="Pike2">David Wingeate Pike, op.cit., [http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN0415227801&id=-9uRoGlfSM8C&pg=PR12&lpg=PR12&dq=Mauthausen&vq=Mauthausen&sig=d1_lzMojjgGddtkjvK4R_Nl5i1A p.XII]</ref> and "over 150,000"<ref name="Wrogom">{{pl icon}} {{cite book | author =various authors | coauthors = Marian Filip, Miko<U+0142>aj <U+0141>omacki et al.| title =Wrogom ku przestrodze: Mauthausen 5 maja 1945 | year =1962 | pages =56 | publisher =ZG ZBoWiD | location =Warsaw }}</ref>.

Various historians place the total death toll in the four main camps of Mauthausen, Gusen I, Gusen II and Gusen III at between 55,000<ref name="Abzug"/> and 60,000<ref name="Gilbert">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Martin Gilbert]] | title =The Holocaust : A History of the Jews of Europe During the Second World War | year =1987 | pages =976 | publisher =Owl Books | id =ISBN 0805003487 }} According to Martin Gilbert, there were 30,000 deaths in Mauthausen and its sub-camps in the first four months of 1945.

Out of an up to 320,000 prisoners who were incarcerated in various sub-camps of KZ Mauthausen-Gusen throughout its existence only approximately 80,000 survived the war<ref name="Hlav<U+00E1><U+010D>ek">{{cs icon}} {{cite book | author =Stanislav Hlav<U+00E1><U+010D>ek | coauthors = | title =Koncentra<U+010D>n<U+00ED> T<U+00E1>bor Mauthausen; Pam<U+011B>tn<U+00ED> tisk k 55. v<U+00FD>ro<U+010D><U+00ED> osvobozen<U+00ED> KTM (Mauthausen concentration camp: Memorial publication for the 55th anniversary of the liberation) | year =2000 | editor = | pages = | chapter =Historie KTM | chapterurl =http://www.volny.cz/mauthausen/chronologie.html | publisher = | location = | id =ISBN | url =http://www.volny.cz/mauthausen/ | format = | accessdate =2006-05-18 }}</ref>, including between 20,487<ref name="Wlaz<U+0142>owski-numbers"/> and 21,386<ref name="Dobosiewicz-Gusen-numbers">Stanis<U+0142>aw Dobosiewicz, ''Mauthausen/Gusen; Ob<U+00F3>z <U+015B>mierci'', op.cit., p. 397; the difference in numbers given is most probably the result of the fact that Dobosiewicz included roughly 700 inmates who were held in the Revier at the time of liberation</ref> in Gusen I, II and III.

During the final months before liberation, the camp's commander [[Franz Ziereis]] prepared for its defence against a possible Soviet offensive. Most of the inmates of German and Austrian nationality "volunteered" for the [[SS-Freiwillige H<U+00E4>ftlingsdivision]], an SS unit composed mostly of former concentration camp inmates and headed by [[Oskar Dirlewanger]]. The remaining prisoners were rushed to build a line of granite anti-tank obstacles to the east of Mauthausen. The inmates unable to cope with the hard labour and malnutrition were exterminated in large numbers to free space for newly-arrived evacuation transports from other camps, including most of the sub-camps of Mauthausen-Gusen located in eastern Austria. In the final months of the war the main source of calories, that is the parcels of food sent through the [[International Red Cross]], stopped and food rations became catastrophically low. The prisoners transferred to the "Hospital Sub-camp" received one piece of bread per 20 inmates and roughly half a litre of weed soup a day<ref name="Dobosiewicz-food rations">Dobosiewicz, op.cit., pp.374-375</ref>. This made some of the prisoners, previously engaged in various types of resistance activity, begin to prepare plans to defend the camp in case of an SS attempt to exterminate all the remaining inmates. It is not known why the prisoners of Gusen I and II were not exterminated ''en-masse'', despite direct orders from [[Heinrich Himmler]]; Ziereis' plan assumed rushing all the prisoners into the tunnels of the underground factories of Kellerbau and blowing up the entrances. The plan was known to one of the Polish resistance organizations which started an ambitious plan of gathering tools necessary to dig air vents in the entrances. 

On [[April 28]], under cover of a fictional air-raid alarm, some 22,000 prisoners of Gusen were rushed into the tunnels. However, after several hours in the tunnels all of the prisoners were allowed to return to the camp. [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Dobosiewicz]], the author of a monumental monograph of the Mauthausen-Gusen complex explains that one of the possible causes of the failure of the German plan was that the Polish prisoners managed to cut the fuse wires. Ziereis himself stated in his testimony written on [[May 25]] that it was his wife who convinced him not to follow the order from above<ref name="Dobosiewicz-final">Stanis<U+0142>aw Dobosiewicz, op.cit.,pp. 382-388</ref>. Although the plan was abandoned, the prisoners feared that the SS might want to massacre the prisoners by other means. Because of that the Polish, Soviet and French prisoners prepared a plan for an assault on the barracks of the SS guards in order to seize the arms necessary to put up a fight. A similar plan was also devised by the Spanish inmates<ref name="Dobosiewicz-final"/>. 

On [[May 3]], the SS and other guards started to prepare for evacuation of the camp. The following day the guards of Mauthausen were replaced with unarmed [[Volkssturm]] soldiers and an improvised unit formed of elderly police officers and fire fighters evacuated from Vienna. The police officer in charge of the unit accepted the "inmate self-government" as the camp's highest authority and [[Martin Gerken]], until then the highest-ranking kapo prisoner in the Gusen's administration (in the rank of ''Lager<U+00E4>lteste'', or the ''Camp's Elder''), became the new ''de facto'' commander. He attempted to create an International Prisoner Committee that would become a provisional governing body of the camp until it was liberated by one of the approaching armies, but he was openly accused of co-operation with the SS and the plan failed. All work in the sub-camps of Mauthausen stopped and the inmates focused on preparations for their liberation - or defence of the camps against a possible assault by the SS divisions concentrated in the area<ref name="Dobosiewicz-final"/>. The remnants of several German divisions indeed assaulted the Mauthausen sub-camp, but were repelled by the prisoners who took over the camp<ref name="<U+017B>eromski"/>. Out of all the main sub-camps of Mauthausen-Gusen only Gusen III was to be evacuated. On [[May 1]] the inmates were rushed on a [[death march]] towards [[Sankt Georgen]], but were ordered to return to the camp after several hours. The operation was repeated the following day, but called off soon afterwards. The following day the SS guards escaped leaving the prisoners to their own fate<ref name="Dobosiewicz-final"/>.

The camps of Mauthausen-Gusen were the last to be liberated during the [[World War II]]. On [[May 5]], [[1945]] the camp at Mauthausen was approached by soldiers of the 41st Recon Squad of the [[US 11th Armoured Division]], [[3rd US Army]]. The reconaissance squad was led by S/SGT Albert J. Kosiek. His troop disarmed the policemen and left the camp. By the time of its liberation, most of the SS-men of Mauthausen had already fled; however, some 30 who were left were lynched by the prisoners<ref name="Dobosiewicz-liberty">Stanis<U+0142>aw Dobosiewicz, op.cit., pp.395-397</ref>; a similar number were lynched in Gusen II<ref name="Dobosiewicz-liberty"/>. Until [[May 6]] all the remaining sub-camps of the Mauthausen-Gusen camp complex, with the exception of the two camps in the [[Loibl Pass]], were also liberated by American forces.

Among the inmates liberated from the camp was Lieutenant [[Jack Taylor]], an officer of the [[Office of Strategic Services]]<ref name="Taylor">{{en icon}} {{cite web | author= | title= Jack Taylor, American Agent Who Survived Mauthausen | publisher= | year=2006 | work=Jewish Virtual Library | url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/mauth32.html | accessdate=2006-04-28 }}</ref>. He had managed to survive with the help of several prisoners and was later a key witness at the [[Mauthausen-Gusen camp trials]] carried out by the [[Dachau International Military Tribunal]]<ref name="Taylor2">{{en icon}} {{cite journal | author = [[Jack Taylor]] | year = 2003 | month = 3rd Quarter | title = OSS Archives: The Dupont Mission | journal = The BLAST; UDT-SEAL Association | url = http://www.udtseal.org/oss.html | accessdate = 2006-04-28 }}</ref>. Another of the camp's survivors was [[Simon Wiesenthal]], an engineer who spent the rest of his life hunting Nazi [[war criminal]]s.

Following the capitulation of Germany, the Mauthausen-Gusen complex fell within the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet sector of occupation of Austria]].  Initially the Soviet authorities used parts of the Mauthausen and Gusen I camps as [[barracks]] for the [[Red Army]]. At the same time the underground factories were being dismantled and sent to the USSR as a war booty. After that, between 1946 and 1947, the camps were unguarded and many furnishings and facilities of the camp were dismantled, both by the Red Army and by the local population. In the early summer of 1947 the Soviet forces blown the tunnels up and were then withdrawn from the area, while the camp was turned over to Austrian civilian authorities. However, it was not until 1949 that it was declared a national [[memorial]] site. Finally, 25 years after camp's liberation, on [[May 3]], [[1975]] Chancellor [[Bruno Kreisky]] officially opened the Mauthausen Museum<ref name="Bischof"/>.
Unlike Mauthausen, much of what constituted the sub-camps of Gusen I, II and III is now covered by residential areas built there after the war<ref name="Terrance 2">Marc Terrance, op.cit., [http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN1581128398&id=TNt9IVBVeNQC&vq=Mauthausen&dq=Mauthausen&lpg=PA137&pg=PA139&sig=JR-vHriYISIpCknJg7JauymBJ8M pp.138-139]</ref>.
