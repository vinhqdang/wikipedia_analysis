'''''Helicobacter pylori''''' ({{IPA-en|<U+02CC>h<U+025B>l<U+0268>k<U+0275><U+02C8>b<U+00E6>kt<U+0259>r p<U+026A><U+02C8>l<U+0254>ra<U+026A>}}) is a [[Gram-negative]], [[microaerophile|microaerophilic]] [[bacterium]] that can inhabit various areas of the [[stomach]], particularly the [[Pyloric_antrum|antrum]]. It causes a chronic low-level [[inflammation]] of the stomach lining and is strongly linked to the development of duodenal and gastric [[peptic ulcer|ulcer]]s and stomach [[cancer bacteria|cancer]]. Over 80% of individuals infected with the bacterium are [[asymptomatic]].

The bacterium was initially named ''Campylobacter pyloridis'', then renamed ''C. pylori'' (pylori = [[genitive]] of [[pylorus]]) to correct a [[Latin grammar]] error.  When [[16S rRNA]] [[DNA sequencing|gene sequencing]] and other research showed in 1989 that the bacterium did not belong in the genus ''[[Campylobacter]]'', it was placed in its own [[genus]], ''[[Helicobacter]]''. The genus derived from the [[ancient Greek]] ''h<U+011B>lix''/<U+03AD><U+03BB><U+03B9><U+03BE> "spiral" or "coil".<ref name=Liddell1980>{{cite book

[[Image:pylorigastritis.jpg|thumb|right|''H. pylori'' colonized on the surface of regenerative epithelium (image from [[Warthin<U+2013>Starry stain|Warthin-Starry's silver stain]])]]
Diagnosis of infection is usually made by checking for [[dyspepsia|dyspeptic]] symptoms and by tests which can indicate ''H. pylori'' infection.  One can test noninvasively for ''H. pylori'' infection with a [[blood]] [[antibody]] test, stool [[antigen]] [[stool test|test]], or with the [[Urea breath test|carbon urea breath test]] (in which the patient drinks [[carbon-14|<sup>14</sup>C]]- or [[carbon-13|<sup>13</sup>C]]-labelled [[urea]], which the bacterium metabolizes, producing labelled [[carbon dioxide]] that can be detected in the breath).<ref name="Stenstr<U+00F6>m B, Mendis A, Marshall B 2008 608<U+2013>12">{{cite journal

Blood antibody tests, for example, range from 76% to 84% [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]].

==Prevention==
''H. pylori'' is a major cause of diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract.  Eradication of the infection in individuals will improve symptoms including dyspepsia, gastritis and peptic ulcers, and may prevent gastric cancer.  Rising [[antibiotic resistance|antimicrobial resistance]] increases the need for a prevention strategy for the bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal

Studies have recently been published suggesting that ''H. pylori'' activity could be suppressed via dietary methods. A 2009 Japanese study in ''Cancer Prevention Research'' found that eating as little as 70 g (2.5 ounces) of [[broccoli sprouts]] daily for two months reduces the number of colonies of ''H. pylori'' bacteria in the stomach by 40% in mice and humans.  This treatment also seems to help by enhancing the protection of the gastric mucosa against ''H. pylori'', but is relatively ineffective on related gastric cancers.  The previous infection returned within two months after broccoli sprouts were removed from the diet, so an ongoing inclusion in the diet is best for continued protection from ''H. pylori''.<ref>{{cite journal

An article in the ''[[American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]]'' found evidence that "ingesting [[lactic acid bacteria]] exerts a suppressive effect on ''Helicobacter pylori'' infection in both animals and humans," noting that "supplementing with [[Lactobacillus]]- and [[Bifidobacterium]]-containing yogurt (AB-yogurt) was shown to improve the rates of eradication of ''H. pylori'' in humans."<ref>''American Journal of Clinical Nutrition'', found at [http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/abstract/80/3/737 American Journal of Clinical Nutrition website]</ref>

==Prognosis==

''H. pylori'' colonizes the stomach and induces chronic [[gastritis]], a long-lasting inflammation of the stomach. The bacterium persists in the stomach for decades in most people. Most individuals infected by ''H. pylori'' will never experience clinical symptoms despite having chronic gastritis. Approximately 10-20% of those colonized by ''H. pylori'' will ultimately develop gastric and duodenal ulcers.<ref name="pmid16847081"/> ''H. pylori'' infection is also associated with a 1-2% lifetime risk of [[gastric carcinoma|stomach cancer]] and a less than 1% risk of gastric [[MALT lymphoma]].<ref name="pmid16847081"/>

It is widely believed that in the absence of treatment, ''H. pylori'' infection<U+2014>once established in its gastric niche<U+2014>persists for life.<ref name="Brown"/>  In the elderly, however, it is likely infection can disappear as the stomach's mucosa becomes increasingly [[Atrophy|atrophic]] and inhospitable to colonization. The proportion of acute infections that persist is not known, but several studies that followed the natural history in populations have reported apparent spontaneous elimination.<ref name=Goodman_2005>{{cite journal

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of peptic ulcer disease and Helicobacter pylori}}
''Helicobacter pylori'' was first discovered in the stomachs of patients with gastritis and stomach ulcers in 1982 by Dr. [[Barry Marshall]] and Dr. [[Robin Warren]] of [[Perth, Western Australia]]. At the time the conventional thinking was that no bacterium can live in the human stomach as the stomach produced extensive amounts of acid of strength to the acid found in a [[car battery]]. Marshall and Warren rewrote the textbooks with reference to what causes gastritis and gastric ulcers.
In recognition of their  discovery, they were awarded the 2005 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].<ref>{{cite web

Among some rod-like bacteria, he also found bacteria with a characteristic spiral shape, which he called ''Vibrio rugula''. He was the first to suggest a possible role of this organism in the pathogenesis of gastric diseases. This work was included in the ''Handbook of Gastric Diseases'', but it had little impact as it was written in Polish.<ref>{{cite journal

After numerous unsuccessful attempts at culturing the bacteria from the stomach, they finally succeeded in visualizing colonies in 1982 when they unintentionally left their [[Petri dishes]] incubating for 5 days over the [[Easter]] weekend. In their original paper, Warren and Marshall contended that most stomach ulcers and gastritis were caused by infection by this bacterium and not by [[stress (medicine)|stress]] or [[Spice|spicy food]] as had been assumed before.<ref>{{cite journal

Although there was some skepticism initially, within several years numerous research groups verified the association of ''H. pylori'' with gastritis and to a lesser extent ulcers.<ref>{{cite web

He became ill with nausea and vomiting several days later. An [[endoscopy]] ten days after inoculation revealed signs of gastritis and the presence of ''H. pylori''. These results suggested that ''H. pylori'' was the causative agent of gastritis. Marshall and Warren went on to demonstrate that antibiotics are effective in the treatment of many cases of gastritis.  In 1987 the Sydney [[Gastroenterology|gastroenterologist]] [[Thomas Borody]] invented the first triple therapy for the treatment of duodenal ulcers.<ref name=Borody_1989>{{cite journal

Recent research states that [[genetic diversity]] in ''H. pylori'' decreases with geographic distance from [[Eastern Africa|East Africa]], the birthplace of modern humans. Using the genetic diversity data, the researchers have created simulations that indicate the bacteria seems to have spread from East Africa around 58,000 years ago. Their results indicate modern humans were already infected by ''H. pylori'' before their migrations out of Africa, remaining associated with human hosts since that time.<ref>{{cite journal
