'''Chiropractic education''' trains future [[chiropractic|chiropractors]]. The entry criteria, structure, teaching methodology and nature of chiropractic programs offered at chiropractic schools vary considerably around the world{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}. To help standardize chiropractic education, in 2005 the World Health Organization published guidelines for basic training in chiropractic.<ref name=WHO>http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/Chiro-Guidelines.pdf</ref> In general, the World Health Organization lists three potential educational paths involving full<U+2010>time chiropractic education across the globe. This includes: 1 <U+2013> 4 years of pre-requisite training in basic sciences at university level followed by a 4 year full<U+2010>time Doctorate program; DC. A 5 year integrated bachelor degree; BSc (Chiro). A 2 - 3 year Masters program following the completion of a bachelor degree; MSc (Chiro).<ref name=WHO-guidelines/>

Regardless of the model of education utilized, prospective chiropractors without relevant prior health care education or experience, must spend no less than 4200 student/teacher contact hours (or the equivalent) in four years of full<U+2010>time education. This includes a minimum of 1000 hours of supervised clinical training.<ref name=WHO-guidelines>{{cite journal |author= World Health Organization |year=2005 |title= WHO guidelines on basic training and safety in chiropractic |url=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/Chiro-Guidelines.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-03-03}}</ref> Health professionals with advanced clinical degrees, such as medical doctors, can meet the educational and clinical requirements to practice as a chiropractor in 2200 hours, which is most commonly done in countries where the profession is in its infancy.<ref name=WHO /> Upon meeting all clinical and didactic requirements of chiropractic school, a degree in chiropractic medicine is granted.



==Chiropractic Career==

Realistic median annual wage of chiropractors was $67,200 in May 2010<ref>Occupational Outlook Handbook, Bureau of Labor Statistics, March 29, 2012: http://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/chiropractors.htm
</ref>.  According to Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Chiropractic Student Loan Default Rates for October 1999, May 2010, and January 2012 are 54%, 53.8%, and 52.8% respectively<ref>Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), January 2012:  http://www.chirobase.org/03Edu/
</ref>. Chiropractic school graduates default on their loans more often than law school graduates, engineers, medical doctors, and business school graduates.

==Investigations==

=== Spinal dysfunction/subluxation ===
{{Main|Spinal dysfunction}}
Spinal dysfunction, dubbed ''subluxation'' by chiropractors, is hypothesized to interfere with optimal biomechanics, thereby altering proper neurological function. Chiropractic theory suggests spinal dysfunction/subluxation may contribute to neuromusculoskeletal and [[visceral]] disorders via aberrant spinal segmental and suprasegmental reflexes. While spinal manipulation is widely seen as a reasonable treatment option for biomechanical disorders of the spine, such as neck pain and low back pain, the use of spinal manipulation to treat non-musculoskeletal complaints remains controversial.<ref>{{cite journal|coauthors=Bolton PS, Budgell B.|title=Visceral responses to spinal manipulation.|journal=J Electromyogr Kinesiol.|year=2012|month=Oct|volume=22|issue=5|pages=777<U+2013>784|pmid=22440554|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> Chiropractors suggest spinal manipulation normalizes spine biomechanics, and as a consequence, normalizes afferent input to the central nervous system resulting in optimized neurological function and improved health outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal|coauthors=H.

===Safety===
The safe application of spinal manipulation requires a thorough medical history, assessment, diagnosis and plan of management.  Manipulative therapists, including chiropractors, must rule out [[contraindications]] to HVLA spinal manipulative techniques.  Absolute contraindications refers to diagnoses and conditions that put the patient at risk to developing [[adverse events]].  For example, a diagnosis of [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and other conditions that structurally destabilizes joints, is an absolute contraindication of SMT to the upper cervical spine. Relative contraindications, such as [[osteoporosis]] are conditions where increased risk is acceptable in some situations and where mobilization and [[soft-tissue]] techniques would be treatments of choice. Most contraindication apply only to the manipulation of the affected region.<ref name=CCA-CFCREAB-CPG>{{cite journal|journal=J Can Chiropr Assoc|year=2005|volume=49|issue=3|pages=158<U+2013>209|title= Chiropractic clinical practice guideline: evidence-based treatment of adult neck pain not due to whiplash|author= Anderson-Peacock E, Blouin JS, Bryans R ''et al.''|url=http://jcca-online.org/ecms.ashx/PDF/2005/2005-3/Chiropracticclinicalpracticeguideline-evidence-basedtreatmentofadultneckpainnotduetowhiplash.pdf|format=PDF|pmid=17549134|pmc=1839918 }}<br/><U+2022> {{cite journal|journal=J Can Chiropr Assoc|year=2008|volume=52|issue=1|pages=7<U+2013>8|title=A Clinical Practice Guideline Update from The CCA<U+2022>CFCREAB-CPG|author= Anderson-Peacock E, Bryans B, Descarreaux M ''et al.''|url=http://jcca-online.org/ecms.ashx/PDF/2008/2008-1/ClinicalPracticeGuidelineUpdatefromTheCCACFCREABCPG.pdf|format=PDF|pmid=18327295|pmc=2258235 }}</ref>

==Licensure and regulation==
{{see also|List of chiropractic schools}}
Regulations for chiropractic practice vary considerably from country to country. In some countries, such as. the United States of America, Canada and some European countries, chiropractic has been legally recognized and formal university degrees have been established. In these countries, the profession is regulated and the prescribed
educational qualifications are generally consistent, satisfying the requirements of the respective accrediting agencies.  However, many countries have not yet developed chiropractic education or established laws to regulate the qualified practice of chiropractic. In addition, in some countries, other qualified health professionals and lay practitioners may use techniques of spinal manipulation and claim to provide chiropractic services, although they may not have received chiropractic training in an accredited programme.

===United States===
Graduates of [[chiropractic schools]] receive the degree ''Doctor of Chiropractic (DC)'', call themselves [[Doctor (title)|doctor]], although this title is incorrect in a clinical setting, and are eligible to seek licensure in all jurisdictions. The [[Council on Chiropractic Education]] (CCE) sets minimum guidelines for chiropractic colleges,<ref>http://www.cce-usa.org/uploads/2007_January_STANDARDS.pdf</ref> but additional requirements may be needed for a license depending on the [[jurisdiction]] where a chiropractor chooses to practice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} All 18 chiropractic institutions are accredited by the CCE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cce-usa.org/Accredited_Doctor_Chiro.html |title=Doctor of Chiro Programs |publisher=Cce-usa.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}</ref> The minimum prerequisite for enrollment in a chiropractic college set forth by the CCE is 90 semester hours, and the minimum cumulative GPA for a student entering is 3.0 on a 4.0 scale.<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome from the Council Chair|url=http://www.cce-usa.org/|publisher=Council on Chiropractic Education}}</ref>{{verify source|date=February 2013}} Common prerequisite classes include those of the biological, chemical, & physical sciences, including: [[human anatomy]] and [[human physiology|physiology]], [[embryology]], [[genetics]], [[microbiology]], [[immunology]], [[cellular biology]], [[exercise physiology]], [[kinesiology]], [[general chemistry]], [[organic chemistry]], [[analytical chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], [[pharmacology|toxicology/pharmacology]], [[nutrition]], [[nuclear medicine]], [[physics]], [[biomechanics]], and [[statistics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palmer.edu/PrerequisitesDC/ |title=Admissions Requirements - D.C |publisher=Palmer.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}</ref> American chiropractic schools tend to have lower entry requirements than medical or dental schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chiroweb.com/archives/ahcpr/uschiros.PDF|title=Chiropractic in the United States: Training, Practice, and Research|last=Cherkin|coauthors=Mootz|accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref> In 2005, only one chiropractic college required a bachelors degree as an admission requirement.<ref name="wyatt">{{cite journal|last=Wyatt|first=Lawrence H|coauthors=Stephen M Perle, Donald R Murphy, and Thomas E Hyde|date=2005-07-07|title=The necessary future of chiropractic education: a North American perspective|journal=Chiropractic & Osteopathy|volume=13|issue=10|doi=10.1186/1746-1340-13-10|page=10|pmid=16001976|pmc=1181629}}</ref>

===Australia===
In Australia, a minimum of five-years worth of chiropractic education is needed before one may register as a practicing chiropractor.

===United Kingdom===
In 1993, HRH Princess Diana visited the [[Anglo-European College of Chiropractic]] and became its patron. She also appeared at a news conference that launched a report calling for legislation to prevent unqualified individuals from practicing Chiropractic in the UK.<ref name=patron>{{cite journal|last=Staff|first=|title=Chiropractic Report Calls for Registry of DCs in United Kingdom|journal=Dynamic Chiropractic |volume=11|page=|issue=13|date=June 18, 1993|url=http://www.chiroweb.com/mpacms/dc/article.php?id=42352}}</ref> In 1994, Parliament passed legislation regulating the practice of Chiropractic, like other health care professions, and creating the [[General Chiropractic Council]] as the regulatory board. Since that time, it is illegal to call oneself a Chiropractor in the UK without being registered with the General Chiropractic Council.<ref>{{cite web| title = Regulation of chiropractic| url = http://www.chiropractic-uk.co.uk/default.aspx?m=3&mi=19&ms=8&title=Regulation+of+chiropractic | accessdate = 12/02/2009 }}</ref>
There are three UK chiropractic colleges with chiropractic courses recognised by the [[General Chiropractic Council]] (GCC), the statutory governmental body responsible for the regulation of chiropractic in the UK.<ref>[http://www.gcc-uk.org/page.cfm?page_id=25 GCC Criteria for Recognition of Degrees in Chiropractic]</ref>

===New Zealand===
The College was formed in 1994 by the New Zealand Chiropractors<U+2019> Association (NZCA) to address the demand created by a shortage of chiropractors in New Zealand. Its first location was in Auckland city and its founding President was Dr Jim Stinear. By the end of 1999 New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) approval of the BSc (Chiropractic) /BSc qualification had been gained and College ownership was transferred to the NZCA Chiropractic Education Trust, a not-for-profit organisation. In 2002 the College was renamed the New Zealand College of Chiropractic. In 2005 the College obtained its first accreditation by the CCEA (Council on Chiropractic Education Australasia). The College was re-accredited in 2007 and in the same year moved to its new campus in Mount Wellington.

==Fellowships and scholarly designations==
Chiropractors, like other health care professionals, can pursue [[post-graduate]] education in various chiropractic specialties such as [[veterinary chiropractic|animal chiropractic]], [[sports chiropractic]] as well as clinical sciences, radiology and others. There are some other chiropractic credentials, however, that are not recognized by the major health care organizations, medical or chiropractic communities. The following is a [[list of chiropractic credentials|comprehensive list]] of the various designations that chiropractors can attain with further continuing and post-graduate education programmes.

==Accreditation==
{{main|Councils on Chiropractic Education International}}
Chiropractic is governed internationally by the Councils on Chiropractic Education International (CCEI). This body is officially recognized by the [[World Federation of Chiropractic]] and the [[World Health Organization]] as the accrediting agency for schools of chiropractic across the world. In 2005, in efforts to improving the consistency and equivalency in chiropractic schools, the basic training and safety were developed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Basic training and safety in chiropractic|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/m/abstract/Js14076e/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref>
