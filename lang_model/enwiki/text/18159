The '''East End of London''', known locally as the '''East End''', generally refers to the area of [[London]], [[England]], east of the medieval walled [[City of London]] and north of the [[River Thames]], although it is not defined by universally accepted formal boundaries. Use of the term began in the late [[19th century]]<ref>''Oxford Dictionary of London Place Names'' A Mills (2000)</ref> and arose with the rapid expansion of the population in London, which led to extreme overcrowding throughout the area and a concentration of poor people and immigrants. These problems were exacerbated with the construction of [[St Katharine Docks]] (1827),<ref>By the early 19th century, over 11,000 people were crammed into insanitary slums in an area, which took its name from the former Hospital of St Catherine that had stood on the site since the 12th century.</ref> and the central London railway termini (1840-1875) that caused the clearance of former slums and [[rookeries]], with many of the displaced people moving into the East End. Over the course of a century, the East End became synonymous with poverty, overcrowding, disease and criminality.<ref name=palmer>''The East End'' Alan Palmer, (John Murray, London 1989)</ref>

The East End developed rapidly during the 19th century from being an area characterised by villages clustered around the City walls or along the main roads, surrounded by farmland, with marshes and small communities by the River, serving the needs of shipping and the [[Royal Navy]]. Until the arrival of formal docks, shipping was required to land its goods in the [[Pool of London]], but industries related to construction, repair, and victualling ships flourished in the area from [[Tudor era|Tudor times]]. Successive waves of immigration began with [[Huguenot]] refugees creating a new extra-mural suburb in [[Spitalfields]] in the [[17th century]].<ref name=Huguenot>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22743 ''Bethnal Green: Settlement and Building to 1836'', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11: Stepney, Bethnal Green (1998), pp. 91-5] Date accessed: 17 April 2007</ref> They were followed by [[Irish people|Irish]] weavers,<ref name=Irish>''Irish in Britain'' John A.

Date accessed: 17 April 2007</ref> Many of these immigrants worked in the clothing industry. The abundance of semi- and unskilled labour led to low wages and poor conditions throughout the East End. This brought the attentions of social reformers during the mid-[[18th century]] and led to the formation of [[unions]] and workers associations at the end of the century. The radicalism of the East End contributed to the formation of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and demands for the [[enfranchisement]] of women.

Official attempts to address the overcrowded housing began at the beginning of the 20th century under the [[London County Council]]. [[World War II]] devastated much of the East End, with its docks, railways and industry forming a continual target, leading to dispersal of the population to new suburbs, and new housing being built in the 1950s.<ref name=palmer/> The final closure of the [[London docks]] in 1980 created further challenges and led to attempts at regeneration and the formation of the [[London Docklands Development Corporation]].

== Origin and scope ==
The term 'East End' was first applied to the districts immediately to the east of, and entirely outside, the [[medieval]] walled [[City of London]] and north of the [[River Thames]]; these included [[Whitechapel]] and [[Stepney]]. By the late 19th century, the East End roughly corresponded to the [[Tower division]] of [[Middlesex]], which from 1900 formed the [[metropolitan borough]]s of [[Metropolitan Borough of Stepney|Stepney]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green|Bethnal Green]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Poplar|Poplar]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch|Shoreditch]] in the [[County of London]]. Today it corresponds to the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]] and the southern part of [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]].<ref name=palmer/>
{{cquote|''[The] invention about 1880 of the term 'East End' was rapidly taken up by the new halfpenny press, and in the pulpit and the [[music hall]]&nbsp;... A shabby man from Paddington, St Marylebone or Battersea might pass muster as one of the respectable poor. But the same man coming from Bethnal Green, Shadwell or Wapping was an 'East Ender', the box of Keating's bug powder must be reached for, and the spoons locked up. In the long run this cruel stigma came to do good. It was a final incentive to the poorest to get out of the 'East End' at all costs, and it became a concentrated reminder to the public conscience that nothing to be found in the 'East End' should be tolerated in a Christian country.''|20px|20px|''The Nineteenth Century XXIV'' (1888)<ref>The Nineteenth Century XXIV (1888) p.292; in ''East End 1888'' William Fishman (1998) p.1</ref>}}

Parts of the London boroughs of [[London Borough of Newham|Newham]] and [[London Borough of Waltham Forest|Waltham Forest]], formerly in an area of [[Essex]] known as 'London over the border', are sometimes considered to be in the East End.<ref>[http://apps.newham.gov.uk/history_canningtown/cdickens.htm 'Londoners Over the Border', in ''Household Words'' Charles Dickens 390, September 12, 1857 (Newham archives)] accessed 18 Sep 2007</ref> However, the [[River Lee (England)|River Lee]] is usually considered to be the eastern boundary of the East End and this definition would exclude the boroughs but place them in [[East London, England|East London]].<ref>Fishman (1998) defines the boundaries as being Tower Hamlets and the southern part of Hackney.  By contrast, Palmer (2000) writing about a later period includes the dock areas of Newham.</ref> This extension of the term further east is due to the '[[diaspora]]' of East Enders who moved to [[County Borough of West Ham|West Ham]] about 1886<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=42748 ''West Ham: Introduction'', A History of the County of Essex: Volume 6 (1973), pp. 43-50] accessed: 18 September 2007</ref> and [[County Borough of East Ham|East Ham]] about 1894<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=42740 ''Becontree hundred: East Ham'', A History of the County of Essex: Volume 6 (1973), pp. 1-8] 18 September 2007</ref> to service the new docks and industries established there. In the inter-war period, migration occurred to new estates built to alleviate conditions in the East End, in particular at [[Becontree]] and [[Harold Hill]], or out of London entirely.

The extent of the East End has always been difficult to define. When [[Jack London]] came to London in 1902 his [[Hackney carriage]] driver did not know the way and he observed, ''[[Thomas Cook|Thomas Cook and Son]], path-finders and trail-clearers, living sign-posts to all the World.... knew not the way to the East End''<ref>Jack London, ''The People of the Abyss'' (1903)</ref>

Many East Enders are '[[Cockney]]s', although this term has both a geographic and a linguistic connotation. A traditional definition is that to be a Cockney, one had to born within the sound of [[St Mary-le-Bow|Bow Bells]], situated in [[Cheapside]]. In general, the sound pattern would cover most of the City, and parts of the near East End such as [[Aldgate]] and [[Whitechapel]]. In practice, with no maternity hospitals in the district, today few would be born in the area. The origin of the term is lost, but a plausible explanation is given by Websters.<ref>''[[Webster's Dictionary|New Universal Unabridged Dictionary]]''</ref> London was referred to by the [[Normans]] as the "Land of Sugar Cake" (Old French: ''[[Cockaigne|pais de cocaigne]]''), an imaginary land of idleness and luxury.  A humorous appellation, the word "Cocaigne" referred to all of London and its suburbs, and over time had a number of spellings: ''Cocagne'', ''Cockayne''', and in [[Middle English]], ''Cocknay'' and ''Cockney''.

Its linguistic use is more identifiable, with lexical borrowings from [[Yiddish]], [[Romani language|Romani]], and [[costermonger]] slang, and a distinctive accent that features [[T-glottalization]], a loss of dental fricatives and diphthong alterations, amongst others. The accent is said to be a remnant of early English London speech, modified by the many immigrants to the area.<ref>''Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language'' Ed. Tom McArthur (oxford University Press, 2005)</ref> Accents elsewhere in London were often eliminated by the introduction in the 20th Century of [[received pronunciation]]. Today, few Cockney accents are heard, with many London residents speaking a form of [[Estuary English]].<ref>[http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/estuary/rosew.htm ''Estuary English'' David Rosewarne (1984)] ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]'', 19 (October 1984) accessed 20 Nov 2007</ref>

== History ==
[[Image:1745 Roque Map.jpg|thumb|right|1745 Roque Map of the East End. London is expanding, but there are still large areas of fields to the East of the City.]]
The East End came into being as the separate villages east of London spread and the fields between them were built upon, a process that occurred in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. From the beginning, the East End has always contained some of the poorest areas of London.  The main reasons for this include the following:
*the [[medieval]] system of [[copyhold]], which prevailed throughout the East End, into the 19th century. Essentially, there was little point in developing land that was held on short leases.<ref name=palmer/>
*the siting of noxious industries, such as [[tanning]] and [[fulling]] outside the boundaries of the City, and therefore beyond complaints and official controls.
*the low paid employment in the [[London Docklands|docks]] and related industries, made worse by the trade practices of outwork, [[piecework]] and casual labour.
*and the relocation of the ruling court and national political epicentre to [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]], on the opposite western side of the [[City of London]].

Historically, the East End is conterminous with the Manor of Stepney. This manor was held by the [[Bishop of London]], in compensation for his duties in maintaining and garrisoning the [[Tower of London]]. Further ecclesiastic holdings came about from the need to enclose the marshes and create flood defences along the Thames. [[Edward VI]] passed the land to the [[Baron Wentworth|Wentworth]] family, and thence to their descendants, the Earls of Cleveland. The ecclesiastic system of copyhold, whereby land was leased to tenants for terms as short as seven years, prevailed throughout the manor. This severely limited scope for improvement of the land and new building until the estate was broken up in the 19th century.<ref name=Stepney>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45083 ''Stepney, Old and New London: Volume 2'' (1878), pp. 137-142] accessed: 17 November 2007</ref>

In medieval times, trades were carried out in workshops in and around the owners' premises, in the City. By the time of the Great Fire, these were becoming industries and some were particularly noisome for instance the processing of urine to perform tanning, or required large amounts of space, such as drying clothes after process and dying in fields known as [[tenterground]]s and rope making. Some were dangerous, such as the manufacture of gun powder, or the proving of guns. These activities came to be performed outside the City walls in the near suburbs of the East End. Later, when lead making, bone processing for soap and china came to established, they too located in the East End, rather than the crowded streets of the City.<ref name=palmer/>

The lands to the east of the City had always been used as hunting grounds, for Bishops and Royalty, with [[John of England|King John]] establishing a palace at Bow, the [[Palace of Placentia]] at [[Greenwich]] built by the Regent to [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]], to the south of the River, and [[Henry VIII]] building a hunting lodge at [[Bromley Hall]].<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22734 ''Stepney: Manors and Estates'', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11: Stepney, Bethnal Green (1998), pp. 19-52] accessed: 20 November 2007</ref> These Royal connections continued until after the [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]], when the Royal Court established itself in the [[Palace of Whitehall]], and the offices of politics congregated around them. The East End also lay on the main road to [[Barking Abbey]], important as a religious centre since [[Normans|Norman]] times and where [[William the Conqueror]] had first established his English court.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42722 ''The ancient parish of Barking: Introduction'', A History of the County of Essex: Volume 5 (1966), pp. 184-190] accessed: 20 November 2007</ref>
===Politics and social reform===
[[Image:1882 Reynolds Map.jpg|thumb|right|1882 Reynolds Map of the East End. Development has now eliminated the open fields.]]
At the end of the 17th century, large numbers of [[Huguenot]] weavers arrived in the East End, settling to service an industry that grew up around the new estate at [[Spitalfields]], where master weavers were based. They brought with them a tradition of 'reading clubs', where books were read, often in [[public houses]]. The authorities were suspicious of immigrants meeting, and in some ways they were right, as these grew into workers' associations and political organisations. When, towards the middle of the 18th century, the silk industry fell into a decline - partly due to the introduction of printed [[Calico (fabric)|calico]] cloth, riots ensued. These '[[Spitalfield Riots]]' of 1769 were actually centred to the east, and were put down with considerable force, culminating in two men being hanged in front of the Salmon and Ball public house at [[Bethnal Green]].  One was John Doyle (an [[Irish people|Irish]] weaver), the other John Valline (of Huguenot descent).<ref><cite>[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/corporation/lma_learning/schoolmate/Irish/sm_irish_stories_detail.asp?ID=246 ''The Spitalfields Riots 1769'' at London Metropolitan Archives] accessed on 10 November 2006</ref>

[[Image:Williambooth.jpg|upright|left|thumb|William Booth founded the Salvation Army, in Whitechapel, in 1878]]
[[William Booth]] began his 'Christian Revival Society' in 1865, preaching the gospel in a tent erected in the 'Friends Burial Ground', Thomas Street, [[Whitechapel]]. Others joined his 'Christian Mission', and on [[August 7]] [[1878]] the [[Salvation Army]] was formed at a meeting held at 272 Whitechapel Road.<ref><cite>[http://www1.salvationarmy.org/heritage.nsf/titles/1878_Foundation_Deed_Of_The_Salvation_Army ''1878 Foundation Deed Of The Salvation Army'' (Salvation Army history)] accessed 15 Feb 2007</ref> A statue commemorates both his mission and his work in helping the poor. A [[Dublin]]er, [[Thomas John Barnardo]] came to the [[London Hospital]], Whitechapel to train for medical missionary work in [[China]]. Soon after his arrival in 1866, a [[cholera]] epidemic swept the East End, killing 3,000 people. Many families were left destitute, with thousands of children orphaned and forced to beg or find work in the factories. In 1867, Barnardo set up a [[Ragged School]] to provide a basic education but was shown the many children sleeping rough. His first home for boys was established at [[18 Stepney Causeway, London|18 Stepney Causeway]] in 1870. When a boy died after being turned away (the home was full), the policy was instituted that 'No Destitute Child Ever Refused Admission'.<ref>[http://www.barnardos.org.uk/who_we_are/history.htm ''History of Barnardo's Homes'' (Barnardo's 2007)] accessed 29 May 2007</ref>

In 1884, the [[Settlement movement]] was founded, with settlements such as [[Toynbee Hall]]<ref>Toynbee Hall, named for [[Arnold Toynbee]] was founded in 1884 in Commercial Street as a centre for social reform by [[Samuel Augustus Barnett|Samuel]] and [[Henrietta Barnett]] with support from [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] and [[Wadham College, Oxford]]; its work continues today.</ref> and Oxford House, to encourage university students to live and work in the [[slums]], experience the conditions and try to alleviate some of the poverty and misery in the East End. Notable residents of Toynbee Hall included [[R. H. Tawney]], [[Clement Attlee]], [[Guglielmo Marconi]], and [[William Beveridge]]. The Hall continues to exert considerable influence, with the [[Workers Educational Association]] (1903), [[Citizens Advice Bureau]] (1949) and [[Child Poverty Action Group]] (1965) all being founded or influenced by it.<ref>[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/EDtoynbeeH.htm ''Toynbee Hall'' (Sparticus Educational)] accessed 26 Sep 2007</ref> In 1888, the matchgirls of [[London matchgirls strike of 1888|Bryant and May]], in [[Bow, London|Bow]] struck for better working conditions. This, combined with the many [[London Dock Strike of 1889|dock strikes]] in the same era, made the East End a key element in the foundation of modern [[socialist]] and [[trade union]] organisations, as well as the [[Suffragette]] movement.<ref name=fishman>''East End 1888'' William Fishman (Duckworth 1998) ISBN 0-7156-2174-2</ref>

Towards the end of the 19th century, a new wave of radicalism came to the East End, arriving both with [[Jewish]] [[<U+00E9>migr<U+00E9>]]s fleeing from Eastern European persecution, and [[Russians|Russian]] and [[Germans|German]] radicals avoiding arrest. A German <U+00E9>migr<U+00E9>, [[Rudolf Rocker]], began writing in [[Yiddish]] for ''[[Arbayter Fraynd]]'' (Workers' Friend).  By 1912 he had organised a London garment workers' strike for better conditions and an end to '[[Sweatshop|sweating]]'.<ref>''East End Jewish Radicals 1875-1914'' William J Fishman (Five Leaves Publications, 2004) ISBN 0 9071234 57</ref> Amongst the Russians were such luminaries as [[Peter Kropotkin]], the anarchist. [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]] all attended meetings of the socialist newspaper ''[[Iskra]]'' in 1903; a few years later they met in a warehouse in [[Whitechapel]] to plot the [[October Revolution]]. Afanasy Matushenko, one of the leaders of the [[Russian battleship Potemkin|Potemkin mutiny]], fled the failure of the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] to seek sanctuary in [[Stepney Green]].<ref><cite>[http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/battleship%20potemkin.htm ''The Battleship Potemkin and Stepney Green'' (East London History Society)] accessed on 10 November 2006</ref>

By the 1880s, the casual system caused Dock workers to unionise under [[Ben Tillett]] and [[John Burns]].<ref>John Burns is commemorated in the name given to a current [[Woolwich Ferry]])</ref> This led to a demand for '6d per hour' (''The Docker's Tanner''<ref>2.5p in modern coinage</ref>), and an end to casual labour in the docks.<ref>[http://www.bardaglea.org.uk/docklands/8-strikes-the.html ''The Great Dock Strike of 1889'' (London Docklands History for GCSE), in Smith and Nash, ''The Story of the Dockers' Strike'', 1889] accessed 18 Sep 2007</ref> Colonel G. R. Birt, the general manager at [[Millwall Docks]], gave evidence to a [[Parliamentary committee]], on the physical condition of the workers:
{{cquote|''The poor fellows are miserably clad, scarcely with a boot on their foot, in a most miserable state.... These are men who come to work in our docks who come on without having a bit of food in their stomachs, perhaps since the previous day; they have worked for an hour and have earned 5d. [2p]; their hunger will not allow them to continue: they take the 5d. in order that they may get food, perhaps the first food they have had for twenty-four hours.''|20px|20px|Col. G. R. Birt, in evidence to the Parliamentary Committee (1889)<ref>[http://www.bardaglea.org.uk/docklands/8-strikes-physical.html  London Docklands History] accessed 14 Feb 2007</ref>}} These conditions earned dockers much public sympathy, and after a bitter struggle, the [[London Dock Strike of 1889]] was settled with victory for the strikers, and established a national movement for the unionisation of casual workers, as opposed to the [[craft union]]s that already existed.

[[Image:Angela Georgina Burdett-Coutts.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Lady Angela Burdett-Coutts]]
The philanthropist [[Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts|Angela Burdett-Coutts]] was active in the East End, alleviating poverty by founding a sewing school for ex-weavers in [[Spitalfields]] and building the ornate [[Columbia Road Market|Columbia Market]] in [[Bethnal Green]]. She helped to inaugurate the [[NSPCC|London Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]], was a keen supporter of the '[[Ragged school|Ragged School Union]]',<ref><cite>[http://www.nndb.com/people/257/000102948/ 'Angela Georgina Burdett-Coutts' in ''National Dictionary of Biography''] accessed 3 Feb 2007</ref> and founded institutions such as the East End Dwelling Company. This latter led to the foundation of organisations such as the '4% Dwelling Company', where investors received a financial return on their philanthropy.<ref>[http://fathom.lse.ac.uk/Seminars/21701744/index.html ''Social Policy: From the Victorians to the Present Day'' Susan Morris (LSE seminars)] accessed 10 Nov 2006</ref> Between the 1890s and 1903, when the work was published, the social campaigner [[Charles Booth]] instigated an investigation into the life of London poor (based at Toynbee Hall), much of which was centred on the poverty and conditions in the East End.<ref name=Booth>''Life and Labour of the People in London'' (London: Macmillan, 1902-1903) at [http://booth.lse.ac.uk/ The Charles Booth on-line archive] accessed 10 Nov 2006</ref> Further investigations were instigated by the '[[Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress 1905-09]]', the Commission found it difficult to agree, beyond that change was necessary and produced separate minority and majority reports. The minority report was the work of Booth with the founders of the [[London School of Economics]] [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]]. They advocated focusing on the causes of poverty and the radical notion of poverty being involuntary, rather than the result of innate indolence. At the time their work was rejected but was gradually adopted as policy by successive governments.<ref>[http://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/LSEHistory/webbs.htm ''The Webbs: Beatrice (1858-1943) and Sidney (1859-1947)'' (The history of the LSE)] accessed 15 Nov 2007</ref>

[[Image:Sylvia Pankhurst 1909.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|Sylvia Pankhurst 1882-1960]]
[[Sylvia Pankhurst]] became increasingly disillusioned with the [[suffragette]] movement's inability to engage with the needs of working class women, so in 1912 she formed her own breakaway movement, the [[East London Federation of Suffragettes#East London Federation of Suffragettes|East London Federation of Suffragettes]].  She based it at a baker's shop at [[Bow, London|Bow]] emblazoned with the famous slogan, "[[Votes for Women]]," in large gold letters. The local Member of Parliament, [[George Lansbury]], resigned his seat in [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] to stand for election on a platform of women's enfranchisement. Pankhurst supported him in this, and Bow Road became the campaign office, culminating in a huge rally in nearby [[Victoria Park, East London|Victoria Park]]. Lansbury was narrowly defeated in the election, however, and support for the project in the East End was withdrawn. Pankhurst refocused her efforts, and with the outbreak of [[World War I]], she began a nursery, clinic and cost price canteen for the poor at the bakery. A paper, the ''[[Women's Dreadnought]]'', was published to bring her campaign to a wider audience. Pankhurst spent twelve years in Bow fighting for women's rights. During this time, she risked constant arrest and spent many months in [[Holloway Prison]], often on [[hunger strike]]. She finally achieved her aim of full adult female [[suffrage]] in 1928, and along the way she alleviated some of the poverty and misery, and improved social conditions for all in the East End.<ref><cite>Barbara Castle, ''Sylvia and Christabel Pankhurst'' (Penguin Books, 1987) ISBN 0-14-008761-3</ref>

The alleviation of widespread unemployment and hunger in [[Poplar, London|Poplar]] had to be funded from money raised by the borough itself under the [[Poor Law]]. The poverty of the borough made this patently unfair and lead to the 1921 conflict between government and the local councillors known as the [[Poplar Rates Rebellion]]. Council meetings were for a time held in [[Brixton prison]], and the councillors received wide support.<ref>''Poplarism, 1919-25: George Lansbury and the Councillors' Revolt'' Noreen Branson (Lawrence & Wishart, 1980) ISBN 0-85-315434-1</ref> Ultimately, this led to the abolition of the Poor Laws through the [[Local Government Act 1929]].

The [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|General Strike]] had begun as a dispute between miners and their employers outside London in 1925. On [[1 May]] [[1926]] the [[Trades Union Congress]] called out workers all over the country, including the London dockers. The government had had over a year to prepare and deployed troops to break the dockers' picket lines. Armed food convoys, accompanied by armoured cars drove down the East India Dock Road. By 10 May, a meeting was brokered at [[Toynbee Hall]] to end the strike. The TUC were forced into a humiliating climbdown and the general strike ended on 11 May, with the miners holding out until November.<ref>[http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/breaking%20the%20general%20strike.htm ''Breaking the General Strike'' (East End History Society)] accessed 15 Nov 2007</ref>

===Industry and built environment===
Industries associated with the sea developed throughout the East End, including rope making and shipbuilding. The former location of roperies can still be identified from their long straight, narrow profile in the modern streets, for instance Ropery Street near [[Mile End]]. Shipbuilding was important from the time when [[Henry VIII]] caused ships to be built at [[Rotherhithe]] as a part of [[The Tudors and the Royal Navy|his expansion of the Royal Navy]]. On [[31 January]] [[1858]], the largest ship of that time, the [[SS Great Eastern]], designed by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], was launched from the yard of [[John Scott Russell|Messrs Scott Russell & Co]], of [[Millwall]]. The 211&nbsp;metre (692&nbsp;ft) vessel was too long to fit across the river, and so the ship had to be launched sideways. Due to the technical difficulties of the launch, this was the last big ship to be built on the River, and the industry fell into a long decline.<ref>[http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/ConNarrative.61/chapterId/1225/The-Great-Eastern-as-a-passenger-liner.html ''Building the Great Eastern'' Port Cities London] accessed 17 Apr 2007</ref> Smaller ships, including battleships, continued to be built at the [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company]] at Blackwall until the beginning of the 20th century.

The [[West India Docks]] were established in 1803, providing berths for larger ships and a model for future London dock building. Imported produce from the [[West Indies]] was unloaded directly into quayside warehouses.

The first railway ('The Commercial Railway') to be built, in 1840, was a passenger service based on cable haulage by stationary steam engines that ran the {{convert|3.5|mi|km|1}} from [[Minories railway station|Minories]] to [[Blackwall, London|Blackwall]] on a pair of tracks. It required {{convert|14|mi|km|1}} of hemp rope, and 'dropped' carriages as it arrived at stations, which were reattached to the cable for the return journey, and the train 'reassembling' itself at the terminus. The line was converted to standard gauge in 1859, and steam engines adopted.<ref>''Our Home Railways'' (Volume 2) W.J.

After the opening of [[Liverpool Street station]] (1874), Bishopsgate railway station became a goods yard, in 1881, to bring imports from Eastern ports. With the introduction of containerisation, the station declined, suffered a fire in 1964 that destroyed the station buildings, and it was finally demolished in 2004 for the extension of the [[East London Line]]. In the 19th century, the area north of Bow Road became a major railway centre for the [[North London Railway]], with marshalling yards and a maintenance depot serving both the City and the West India docks. Nearby [[Bow railway station]] opened in 1850 and was rebuilt in 1870 in a grand style, featuring a concert hall. The line and yards closed in 1944, after severe bomb damage, and never reopened, as goods became less significant, and cheaper facilities were concentrated in Essex.<ref>[http://www.subbrit.org.uk/sb-sites/stations/b/bow/index.shtml ''Bow'' (Disused stations, site record)] accessed 23 Oct 2007</ref>

From the mid-20th century, the docks declined in use and were finally closed in 1980, leading to the setting up of the [[London Docklands Development Corporation]] in 1981.<ref>[http://www.lddc-history.org.uk/index.html ''The London Docklands Development Corporation 1981&ndash;1998'' (2007)] accessed 18 Sep 2007</ref> London's main port is now at [[Tilbury]], further down the [[Thames]] estuary, outside the boundary of [[Greater London]]. The dock had been established in 1886 to bring bulk goods by rail to London, but being nearer the sea and able to accommodate vessels of 50,000&nbsp;tons, they were more easily converted to the needs of modern [[container ships]] in 1968, and so they survived the closure of the inner docks.<ref>[http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/ConFactFile.82/Tilbury-Dock.html ''Tilbury Dock (1886-1981)'' (Port Cities)] accessed 29 Sep 2007</ref> Various wharves along the river continue in use but on a much smaller scale.

During the [[Middle Ages]], settlements had been established predominantly along the lines of the existing roads, and the principal villages were Stepney, Whitechapel and Bow. Settlements along the river began at this time to service the needs of shipping on the Thames, but the City of London retained its right to actually land the goods. The riverside became more active in Tudor times, as the Royal Navy was expanded and international trading developed. Downstream, a major fishing port developed at [[Barking]] to provide fish to the City.  Whereas royalty such as [[John of England|King John]] had had a hunting lodge at [[Bromley-by-Bow]], and the [[Bishop of London]] had a palace at [[Bethnal Green]], later these estates began to be split up, and estates of fine houses for captains, merchants and owners of manufacturers began to be built. [[Samuel Pepys]] moved his family and goods to Bethnal Green during the [[Great Fire of London]], and [[Captain Cook]] moved from [[Shadwell]] to [[Stepney Green]], a place where a school and assembly rooms had been established (commemorated by ''Assembly Passage'', and a plaque on the site of Cook's house on the Mile End Road). Mile End Old Town also acquired some fine buildings, and the New Town began to be built. As the area became built up and more crowded, the wealthy sold their plots for sub-division and moved further afield. Into the 18th and 19th centuries, there were still attempts to build fine houses, for example [[Tredegar Square]] (1830), and the open fields around Mile End New Town were used for the construction of estates of workers' cottages in 1820.<ref name=MEOT>[http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/meotra.htm ''What lies beneath ...

But during the 19th century, building on an adhoc basis could never keep up with the needs of the expanding population. [[Henry Mayhew]] visited [[Bethnal Green]] in 1850 and wrote for the ''[[Morning Chronicle]]'', as a part of a series forming the basis for ''[[London Labour and the London Poor]]'' (1851), that the trades in the area included tailors, [[costermonger]]s, shoemakers, dustmen, sawyers, carpenters, cabinet makers and silkweavers. It was noted that in the area:{{cquote|''roads were unmade, often mere alleys, houses small and without foundations, subdivided and often around unpaved courts. An almost total lack of drainage and sewerage was made worse by the ponds formed by the excavation of brickearth. Pigs and cows in back yards, noxious trades like boiling tripe, melting tallow, or preparing cat's meat, and slaughter houses, dustheaps, and 'lakes of putrefying night soil' added to the filth''|20px|20px|Henry Mayhew ''London Labour and London Poor'' (1851)<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22751 'Bethnal Green: Building and Social Conditions from 1837 to 1875', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11: Stepney, Bethnal Green (1998), pp. 120-26] accessed: 14 November 2006.</ref>}}

By 1890 slum clearance programmes had begun. One was the creation of the world's first council housing, the [[London County Council|LCC]] [[Boundary Estate]], which replaced the neglected and crowded streets of Friars Mount, better known as The Old Nichol Street [[Rookery (slum)|Rookery]].<ref>''Walks Through History: Exploring the East End'', Taylor, Rosemary (Breedon Books 2001) ISBN 1 8598327 09</ref> Between 1918 and 1939 the LCC continued replacing East End housing with five or six storey flats, despite residents preferring houses with gardens and opposition from shops that were forced to relocate to new, more expensive premises. The [[World War II|Second World War]] brought an end to further slum clearance.<ref name=BG>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22753 ''Bethnal Green: Building and Social Conditions from 1915 to 1945'', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11: Stepney, Bethnal Green (1998), pp. 132-135] accessed: October 10, 2007</ref>

Initially, the German commanders were reluctant to bomb London, fearing retaliation against [[Berlin]]. On [[24 August]] [[1940]], a single aircraft, tasked to bomb [[Tilbury]], accidentally bombed Stepney, Bethnal Green and the City. The following night the [[RAF]] retaliated by mounting a forty aircraft raid on Berlin, with a second attack three days later. The [[Luftwaffe]] changed its strategy from attacking shipping and airfields to attacking cities. The City and West End were designated 'Target Area B'; the East End and docks were 'Target Area A'. The first raid occurred at 4:30 PM on 7 September and consisted of 150 [[Dornier Do 17|Dornier]] and [[Heinkel He 111|Heinkel]] bombers and large numbers of fighters. This was followed by a second wave of 170 bombers. [[Silvertown]] and [[Canning Town]] bore the brunt of this first attack.<ref name=palmer/>

Between [[7 September]] [[1940]] and [[10 May]] [[1941]], a sustained bombing campaign was mounted, and London was bombed for 57 successive nights, an era known as '[[the Blitz]]'. East London was targeted because the area was a centre for imports and storage of raw materials for the war effort, and the German military command felt that support for the war could be damaged among the mainly working class inhabitants. The populace responded by evacuating children and the vulnerable to the country<ref>An earlier planned evacuation had been met with intense distrust in the East End, families preferring to remain united and in their own homes (see Palmer, 1989).</ref> and digging in, constructing [[Anderson shelter]]s in their gardens and [[Morrison shelter]]s in their houses, or going to communal shelters built in local public spaces.<ref>The man responsible for the shelter programme was [[Charles Kay]] MP, London's Joint Regional Commissioner, and a former councillor and Mayor of Poplar. Elected on a pro-war ticket within the first 30 weeks of war (see Palmer, 1989, p. 139)</ref> Sadly, on [[10 September]] [[1940]], 400 civilians, including women and children preparing for evacuation, were killed when a bomb hit the South Hallsville School in [[Canning Town]].<ref>[http://www.age-exchange.org.uk/eastend/secondworldwar/index.html ''Remembering the East End:The Second World War'' (age-exchange)] accessed 14 Nov 2007</ref> 

The effect of the intensive bombing worried the authorities and '[[Mass Observation]]' was deployed to gauge attitudes and provide policy suggestions,<ref>[http://www.sussex.ac.uk/library/speccoll/collection_catalogues/tclists/tc23.html ''Mass-Observation Archive: Topic Collections:Air Raids 1938-45'' (Box TC23/9/T) (University of Sussex, special collections] accessed 15 Nov 2007</ref> as before the war they had investigated local attitudes to anti-Semitism.<ref>[http://www.sussex.ac.uk/library/speccoll/collection_catalogues/tclists/tc62.html ''Mass-Observation Archive: Topic Collections:Anti-Semitism survey 1939-51'' (University of Sussex, special collections)] accessed 15 Nov 2007</ref> The organisation noted that close family and friendship links within the East End were providing the population with a surprising resilience under fire. Propaganda was issued, reinforcing the image of the 'brave chirpy [[Cockney]]'. On the Sunday after the Blitz began, [[Winston Churchill]] himself toured the bombed areas of Stepney and Poplar. Anti-aircraft installations were built in public parks, such as [[Victoria Park, East London|Victoria Park]] and the Mudchute on the Isle of Dogs, and along the line of the Thames, as this was used by the aircraft to guide them to their target.

The authorities were initially loth to open the [[London Underground]] for shelter, fearing the effect on morale elsewhere in London and hampering normal operations. On 12 September, having suffered five days of heavy bombing, the people of the East End took the matter into their own hands and invaded tube stations with pillows and blankets. The government relented and opened the partially completed [[Central line]] as a shelter. Many deep tube stations remained in use as shelters until the end of the war.<ref name=palmer/>  Aerial mines were deployed on 19 September 1940. These exploded at roof top height, causing severe damage to buildings over a wider radius than the impact bombs. By now, the [[Port of London]] had sustained heavy damage with a third of its warehouses destroyed, and the West India and St Katherine Docks had been badly hit and put out of action. Bizarre events occurred when the [[River Lee]] burned with an eerie blue flame, caused by a hit on a gin factory at [[Three Mills]], and the Thames itself burnt fiercely when [[Tate & Lyle]]'s Silvertown sugar refinery was hit.<ref name=palmer/>

On [[3 March]] [[1943]] at 8:27 PM, the unopened [[Bethnal Green tube station]] was the site of a wartime disaster. Families had crowded into the underground station due to an air raid siren at 8:17, one of 10 that day. There was a panic at 8:27 coinciding with the sound of an anti-aircraft battery (possibly the recently installed [[Z battery]]) being fired at nearby [[Victoria Park, East London|Victoria Park]]. In the wet, dark conditions, a woman slipped on the entrance stairs and 173 people died in the resulting crush. The truth was suppressed, and a report appeared that there had been a direct hit by a German bomb. The results of the official investigation were not released until 1946.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/homeground/archive/2003/bethnal-green-tube-disaster.shtml ''Bethnal Green tube disaster'' (BBC Homeground)] accessed 15 Feb 2007</ref> There is now a plaque at the entrance to the tube station, which commemorates the event as the "worst civilian disaster of World War II". The first [[V-1 flying bomb]] struck in Grove Road, Mile End, on [[13 June]] [[1944]], killing six, injuring 30, and making 200 people homeless.<ref name=MEOT/> The area remained derelict for many years until it was cleared to extend [[Mile End Park]].

By the end of the war, it is estimated that 80&nbsp;tons of bombs fell on the [[Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green]] alone, affecting 21,700 houses, destroying 2,233 and making a further 893 uninhabitable.

===Population===
Throughout history, the area has absorbed waves of [[immigrants]] who have each added a new dimension to the culture and history of the area, most notably the [[French people|French]] [[Protestant]] [[Huguenot]]s in the 17th century,<ref name=Huguenot/> the [[Irish people|Irish]] in the 18th century,<ref name=Irish/> [[Ashkenazi Jews]] fleeing [[pogroms]] in [[Eastern Europe]] towards the end of the 19th century,<ref name=Jews/> and the [[Bangladeshi]]<ref name=Bangla/> community settling in the East End from the 1960s.

[[Image:Brick Lane 2005.jpg|thumb|left|[[Brick Lane]] has been a centre for new immigration through the centuries (Sep 2005)]]
Communities also developed in the riverside settlements. From the Tudor era until the 20th century, ships crew were employed on a casual basis. New and replacement crew would be found wherever they were available, local sailors being particularly prized for their knowledge of currents and hazards in foreign ports. Crews would be paid off at the end of their voyage. Inevitably, permanent communities became established, including colonies of [[Lascar]]s and [[Africans]] from the [[Guinea (region)|Guinea Coast]]. Large [[Chinatown]]s at both [[Shadwell]] and [[Limehouse]] developed, associated with the crews of [[East Indiaman|merchantmen]] in the [[Opium Wars#The Growth of the Opium Trade|opium]] and [[tea]] trades. It was only after the devastation of [[World War II]] that this predominantly [[Han Chinese]] community relocated to [[Chinatown, London|Soho]].<ref>[http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/ConNarrative.127/chapterId/2614/Chinese-in-the-Port-of-London.html ''Port Cities: London's First Chinatown''] accessed 29 May 2007</ref>

Immigrants have not always been readily accepted and, in 1517, the [[Evil May Day]] riots, where foreign owned property was attacked, resulted in the deaths of 135 [[Flemings]] in Stepney. The [[Gordon Riots]] of 1780 began with burnings of the houses of Catholics and their chapels in Poplar and Spitalfields.<ref name=air>[http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/london%20from%20the%20air.htm ''London from the Air'' (East London History Society)] accessed 5 Jul 2007</ref>

The population of the East End increased inexorably throughout the 19th century.  House building could not keep pace, and overcrowding was rife. It was not until the [[interwar period]] that there was a decline caused by migration to new Essex suburbs, like the Becontree estate, built by the [[London County Council]] between 1921 and 1932, and to areas outside London.<ref name=suburb>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42708 ''Metropolitan Essex since 1919: Suburban growth'', A History of the County of Essex: Volume 5 (1966), pp. 63-74] accessed: October 18, 2007</ref> This depopulation accelerated after World War II and has only recently begun to reverse.

===Crime===
The high levels of poverty in the East End have, throughout history, resulted in a corresponding incidence of crime. From earliest times, crime depended, as did labour, on the importing of goods to London, and their interception in transit. Theft occurred in the river, on the quayside and in transit to the City warehouses. This was why, in the 17th century, the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] built high-walled, guarded docks at [[Blackwall, London|Blackwall]] to minimise the vulnerability of their cargoes. Armed convoys would then take the goods to the company's secure compound in the City. The practise led to the creation of ever larger docks throughout the area, and for large roads to be driven through the crowded 19th century slums to carry goods from the docks.<ref name=palmer/>

[[Image:police.boat.london.arp.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The 'Gabriel Franks', of the [[Marine Support Unit]] of the [[Metropolitan Police]], named after the first [[Marine Police Force|marine police]] officer killed in the line of duty]]
No police force operated in London before the 1750s. Crime and disorder were dealt with by a system of magistrates and volunteer parish constables, with strictly limited jurisdiction. Salaried constables were introduced by 1792, although they were few in number and their power and jurisdiction continued to derive from local magistrates, who ''in extremis'' could be backed by militias. In 1798, England's first [[Marine Police Force]] was formed by magistrate Patrick Colquhoun and a Master Mariner, John Harriott to tackle theft and looting from ships anchored in the [[Pool of London]] and the lower reaches of the river. Its base was (and remains) in [[Wapping]] High Street.  It is now known as the [[Marine Support Unit]].<ref><cite>[http://www.met.police.uk/msu/history.htm ''History of the Marine Support Unit'' (Metropolitan Police)] accessed 24 Jan 2007</ref> In 1829, the [[Metropolitan Police Force]] were formed, with a remit to patrol within {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} of [[Charing Cross]], with a force of 1,000 men in 17 divisions, including 'H' division, based in Stepney. Each division was controlled by a superintendent, under whom were four inspectors and sixteen sergeants. The regulations demanded that recruits should be under thirty-five years of age, well built, at least 5&nbsp;foot&nbsp;7 inches in height, literate and of good character.<ref name=metro>[http://www.met.police.uk/history/records.htm Metropolitan Police Records of Service] accessed 23 Oct 2007</ref> Unlike the former constables, the police were recruited widely and so were initially disliked.  The force took until the mid-19th century to be established in the East End. Unusually, Joseph Sadler Thomas, a Metropolitan Police superintendent of 'F' ([[Covent Garden]]) Division appears to have mounted the first local investigation (in Bethnal Green), in November 1830 of the [[London Burkers]].<ref>[http://www.historybytheyard.co.uk/early_murder_investigations.htm Early Murder Investigations] accessed 23 Oct 2007</ref>  In 1841, a specific Dockyard division of the Metropolitan force was formed to assume responsibility for shore patrols within the docks,<ref>[http://www.met.police.uk/history/timeline1829-1849.htm ''History of the Metropolitan Police: Time Line 1829 - 1849''] accessed 23 Oct 2007</ref> a detective department was formed in 1842, and in 1865, 'J' division was established in Bethnal Green.<ref name=metro/>

[[Image:GinLane.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[William Hogarth]]'s depiction of London vice, [[Gin Lane]] (1751)]]
One of the East End industries that serviced ships moored off the Pool of London was [[prostitution]], and in the 17th century, this was centred on the [[Ratcliffe Highway]], a long street lying on the high ground above the riverside settlements. In 1600, it was described by the antiquarian [[John Stow]] as 'a continual street, or filthy straight passage, with alleys of small tenements or cottages builded, inhabited by sailors and victuallers.' Crews were 'paid off' at the end of a long voyage, and would spend their earnings on drink in the local taverns. One madame described as 'the great bawd of the seamen' by [[Samuel Pepys]] was Damaris Page. Born in Stepney in 1620, she had moved from prostitution to running brothels, including one on the Highway that catered for ordinary seaman and a further establishment nearby that catered for the more expensive tastes amongst the officers and gentry. She died wealthy, in 1669, in a house on the Highway, despite charges being brought against her and time spent in [[Newgate prison]].<ref>[http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/ConNarrative.111/chapterId/2339/Prostitution-in-maritime-London.html ''Prostitution in maritime London'' (Port Cities)] accessed 29 Sep 2007</ref> 

By the 19th century, an attitude of toleration had changed, and the social reformer [[William Acton]] described the riverside prostitutes as a 'horde of human tigresses who swarm the pestilent dens by the riverside at Ratcliffe and Shadwell'.  The 'Society for the Suppression of Vice' estimated that between the Houndsditch, Whitechapel and Ratcliffe area there were 1803 prostitutes; and between Mile End, Shadwell and Blackwall 963 women in the trade. They were often victims of circumstance, there being no [[welfare state]] and a high mortality rate amongst the inhabitants that left wives and daughters destitute, with no other means of income.<ref>[http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/ConNarrative.111/chapterId/2347/Prostitution-in-maritime-London.html ''19th century responses to prostitution'' (Port Cities)] accessed 29 Sep 2007</ref> At the same time, religious reformers began to introduction 'Seamans' Missions' throughout the dock areas that both sought to provide for seafarer's physical needs and to keep them away from the temptations of drink and women.  Eventually, the passage of the 'Contagious Diseases Act' in 1864 allowed policemen to arrest prostitutes and detain them in hospital. The act was repealed in 1886, after agitation by early feminists, such as [[Josephine Butler]] and Elizabeth Wolstenholme led to the formation of the [[Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]].<ref>[http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/ConNarrative.111/chapterId/2349/Prostitution-in-maritime-London.html ''Prostitution in maritime London'' (Port Cities)] accessed 29 Sep 2007</ref>

===Disasters===
[[Image:Princess alice collision in thames.jpg|thumb|right|220px|1878 drawing. The ''Bywell Castle'' bears down upon the ''Princess Alice''.]]
Many disasters have befallen the residents of the East End, both in war and in peace. In particular, as a maritime port, plague and [[pestilence]] have disproportionately fallen on the residents of the East End. The area most afflicted by the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague (1665)]] was in Spitalfields,<ref>Plague deaths measured at more than 3000 deaths per 478 sq yards in Spitalfields in 1665 (source: ''London from the Air'')</ref> and cholera epidemics broke out in Limehouse in 1832 and struck again in 1848 and 1854.<ref name=air/> [[Typhus]] and [[tuberculosis]] were also common in the crowded 19th century tenements. The ''[[Princess Alice]]'' was a passenger [[steam ship|steamer]] crowded with day trippers returning from [[Gravesend]] to [[Woolwich]] and [[London Bridge]]. On the evening of [[September 3]] [[1878]], she collided with the steam [[collier]] ''Bywell Castle'' (named for [[Bywell Castle]]) and sank into the [[Thames]] in under four minutes. Of the approximately 700 passengers, over 600 were lost.<ref>[http://www.thamespolicemuseum.org.uk/h_alice_1.html ''Princess Alice Disaster'' Thames Police Museum] accessed 19 Sep 2007</ref>

In [[World War I]], on [[January 19]] [[1917]] 73 people died, including 14 workers, and more than 400 were injured, in a [[Silvertown explosion|TNT explosion]] in the Brunner-Mond munitions factory in [[Silvertown]]. Much of the area was flattened, and the shock wave was felt throughout the city and much of [[Essex]]. This was the largest explosion in London history, and was heard in [[Southampton]] and [[Norwich]]. Andreas Angel, chief chemist at the plant, was posthumously awarded the [[Edward Medal]] for trying to extinguish the fire that caused the blast.<ref>''The Silvertown Explosion: London 1917'' Graham Hill and Howard Bloch (Stroud: Tempus Publishing 2003).

Another tragedy occurred on the morning of [[16 May]] [[1968]] when [[Ronan Point]], a 23-storey [[tower block]] in [[London Borough of Newham|Newham]], suffered a structural collapse due to a [[natural gas]] explosion. Four people were killed in the disaster and seventeen were injured, as an entire corner of the building slid away. The collapse caused major changes in UK building regulations and led to the decline of further building of high rise [[council flats]] that had characterised 1960s public architecture.<ref>''Collapse: Why Buildings Fall Down'' Phil Wearne (Channel 4 books) ISBN 0-7522-1817-4</ref>

The [[Goodman's Fields Theatre]] was established in 1727, and it was here that [[David Garrick]] made his successful d<U+00E9>but as ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', in 1741. In the 19th century the theatres of the East End rivalled in their grandiosity and seating capacity those of the [[West End theatre|West End]]. The first of this era was the ill-fated Brunswick Theatre (1828), which collapsed three days after opening, killing 15 people. This was followed by the opening of the Pavilion (1828) in [[Whitechapel]], the [[Garrick Theatre (Leman St)|Garrick]] (1831) in Leman Street, the Effingham (1834) in Whitechapel, the Standard (1835) in [[Shoreditch]], the City of London (1837) in [[Norton Folgate]], then the Grecian and the [[Britannia Theatre]] in [[Hoxton]] (1840).<ref>Haycroft, Jack Adams and the troupe moved to Hoxton from premises in Shoreditch, that had operated from the early 1830s, [http://www.craxford-family.co.uk/crauart1.php ''The Making of the Britannia Theatre'' Alan D.

There were also many [[Yiddish theatre]]s, particularly around [[Whitechapel]].

The once popular [[music hall]]s of the East End have mostly met the same fate as the theatres. Prominent examples included the London Music Hall (1856-1935), 95-99 Shoreditch High Street, and the Royal Cambridge Music Hall (1864-1936), 136 [[Commercial Street]]. An example of a 'giant pub hall', [[Wilton's Music Hall]] (1858), remains in Grace's Alley, off [[Cable Street]] and the early 'saloon style' [[Hoxton Hall]] (1863) survives in Hoxton Street, [[Hoxton]].<ref>''The Last Empires: A Music Hall Companion'' ed.

[[Image:Hoxton Hall.JPG|upright|thumb|right|[[Hoxton Hall]], still an active community resource and performance space]]. The music hall tradition of live entertainment lingers on in East End public houses, with music and singing. This is complemented by less respectable amusements such as [[striptease]], which, since the 1950's has become a fixture of certain East End pubs, particularly in the area of [[Shoreditch]], despite being a target of local authority harassment.<ref>Lara Clifton (2002) ''Baby Oil and Ice: Striptease in East London''</ref>

Novelist and social commentator [[Walter Besant]] proposed a 'Palace of Delight'<ref>In Walter Besant ''All Sorts and Conditions of Men'' (1882)</ref> with concert halls, reading rooms, picture galleries, an art school and various classes, social rooms and frequent f<U+00EA>tes and dances.

He raised a further <U+00A3>50,000 and secured continued funding from the Draper's Company for ten years (The Whitechapel Society, below)</ref> together with subscriptions to build a 'People's Palace' in the East End. Five acres of land were secured on the Mile End Road, and the ''Queen's Hall'' was opened by [[Queen Victoria]] on [[14 May]] [[1887]]. The complex was completed with a library, swimming pool, gymnasium and winter garden, by 1892, providing an eclectic mix of populist entertainment and education. A peak of 8000 'tickets' were sold for classes in 1892, and by 1900, a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree awarded by the [[University of London]] was introduced.<ref>''From Palace to College - An illustrated account of Queen Mary College'' G.

Professional theatre returned briefly to the East End in 1972, with the formation of the [[Half Moon Theatre]] in a rented former synagogue in Aldgate.

The theatre enjoyed success, with premi<U+00E8>res by [[Dario Fo]], [[Edward Bond]] and [[Steven Berkoff]], but by the mid-1980s, the theatre suffered a financial crisis and closed.

Historically, the East End has suffered from under-investment in both housing stock and infrastructure. From the 1950s, the East End represented the structural and social changes affecting the [[UK economy]] in a microcosm. The area had one of the highest concentrations of [[council housing]], the legacy both of slum clearance and war time destruction.<ref>''Poverty, Housing Tenure and Social Exclusion'' Peter Lee and Alan Murie, (The Policy Press in association with the [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation]], 1997) ISBN 1 86134 063 X</ref> The progressive closure of docks, cutbacks in railways and the closure and relocation of industry contributed to a long term decline, removing many of the traditional sources of low- and semi-skilled jobs.  However, beginning with the LDDC, in the 1980s, there have been a number of [[urban renewal|urban regeneration]] projects, most notably [[Canary Wharf]], a huge commercial and housing development on the [[Isle of Dogs]]. Many of the 1960s tower blocks have been demolished or renovated, replaced by low rise housing, often in private ownership, or owned by [[housing association]]s.<ref>Housing associations, also known as ''registered social landlords'', active in the East End, include: BGVPHA (Bethnal Green and Victoria Park Housing Association, Tower Hamlets Community Housing, Poplar HARCA and EastendHomes.</ref>

Much of the area remains, however, one of the poorest in Britain and contains some of the capital's worst deprivation. This is in spite of rising property prices and the extensive building of luxury apartments centred largely around the former dock areas and alongside the Thames.

The East End has been the subject of parliamentary commissions and other examinations of social conditions since the 19th century, as seen in [[Henry Mayhew]]'s ''[[London Labour and the London Poor]]'' (1851)<ref>Henry Mayhew, ''London Labour and the London Poor'' (London: Griffin, Bohn, and Company, Stationers' Hall Court) in [http://nils.lib.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A4000.01.0140 Volume 1 (1861)], [http://nils.lib.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A4000.01.0141 Volume 2], [http://nils.lib.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A4000.01.0142 Volume 3], and an [http://nils.lib.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A4000.01.0143 additional Volume (1862)] all accessed 14 Nov 2007</ref> and [[Charles Booth]]'s ''Life and Labour of the People in London'' (1902).<ref name=Booth/> Narrative accounts of experiences amongst the East End poor were also written by [[Jack London]] in ''[[The People of the Abyss]]'' (1903) and by [[George Orwell]] in parts of his novel ''[[Down and Out in Paris and London]]'', recounting his own experiences in the 1930s. A further detailed study of Bethnal Green was also carried out in the 1950s by sociologists [[Michael Young (politican)|Michael Young]] and Peter Willmott, in ''[[Family and Kinship in East London]]''.<ref name=family>''Family and Kinship in East London'' [[Michael Young (politican)|Michael Young]] and Peter Willmott (1957) ISBN 978-0140205954</ref>

Themes from these social investigations have been drawn out in fiction. Crime, poverty, vice, sexual transgression, drugs, class-conflict and multi-cultural encounters and fantasies involving Jewish, Chinese and Indian immigrants are major themes. Though the area has been productive of local writing talent, from the time of Oscar Wilde's ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1891) the idea of 'slumming it' in the 'forbidden' East End has held a fascination for a coterie of the literati.<ref name=trav> William Taylor (2001) ''This Bright Field: A Travel Book in One Place''</ref> 

The image of the East Ender changed dramatically between the 19th Century and the 20th. From the 1870s they were characterised in culture as often shiftless, untrustworthy and responsible for their own poverty.<ref name=family/>  However, many East Enders worked in lowly but respectable occupations such as [[carters]], [[porters]] and [[costermonger]]s. This later group particularly became the subject of music hall songs at the turn of the century, with performers such as [[Marie Lloyd]], [[Gus Elen]] and [[Albert Chevalier]] establishing the image of the humorous East End Cockney and highlighting the conditions of ordinary workers.<ref name>[http://books.google.com/books?id=XFnfnKg6BcAC&pg=PA351&lpg=PA351&dq=%22gus+elen%22&source=web&ots=5svEnNz8A-&sig=N1coxv6YYj5jafbpSFvtDhbaFLQ#PPA352,M1  ''Vaudeville, Old and New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America'' pp 351-2, Frank Cullen, Florence Hackman, Donald P. McNeilly (Routledge 2006)] ISBN 0415938538 accessed 22 Oct 2007</ref> This image, buoyed by close family and social links, and the community's fortitude in the war, came to be represented in literature and film. However, with the rise of the Kray Twins, in the 1960s, the dark side of East End character returned, with a new emphasis on criminality and gangsterism.

===Literature===

The East End features in one of the earliest works in English, [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s (1343 - 1400) ''[[The Prioress' Prologue and Tale]]'' (ca. 1390), which makes fun of the Prioress' Cockney accent: ''"After the scole of [[Bow, London|stratford atte bowe]], For frenssh of parys was to hire unknowe"''.<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/CT-prolog-para.html Line 125. Chaucer: ''The Canterbury Tales''] accessed on 14 Nov 2006</ref>

[[Charles Dickens]] (1812-70), throughout his work, draws extensively on his experiences of poverty in London. His godfather had a sail making business in [[Limehouse]], and he based the ''Six Jolly Fellowships'' in ''[[Our Mutual Friend]]'' (1864-65) on a public house still standing there. The Red Bull, a now demolished inn situated in Whitechapel, features in his ''[[Pickwick Papers]]''. On leaving it [[Sam Weller (fictional character)|Sam Weller]] makes the sage remark that Whitechapel is "not a wery nice neighbourhood". [[Fagin]] in Dickens's ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' appears to be  based on a notorious '[[Fence (criminal)|fence]]' named [[Ikey Solomon]] (1785-1850) who operated in 1820's Whitechapel.<ref>Ed Glinert (2000) ''A Literary Guide to London'': 256</ref> Dickens was also a frequent visitor to the East End theatres and music halls of Hoxton, Shoreditch and Whitechapel, writing of his visits in his journals and his journalism.<ref>''Commercial Traveller'' Charles Dickens (1865)</ref>

[[Image:Arthur morrison.jpg|left|upright|thumb|220px|[[Arthur Morrison]], author of ''A Child of the Jago'', an indictment of conditions in the ''Old Nichol'']]
[[Arthur Morrison]] (1863-1945) wrote ''A Child of the Jago'' (1896) a fictional account of the extreme poverty encountered in the [[Old Nichol Street]] [[Rookery]]. [[Oscar Wilde]] (1854-1900) observed the practice of 'people of quality' visiting the many entertainments available in Whitechapel and sent his hedonistic hero [[Dorian Gray]] there to sample the delights on offer in his novel ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]''. [[Israel Zangwill]] (1864-1926) was educated in Spitalfields and wrote the influential ''Children of the Ghetto: A Study of a Peculiar People'' (1892) exploring the Jewish experience in the East End. This was further explored by another Jewish writer, Simon Blumenfeld (1907-2005) whose plays and novels, such as ''Jew Boy'' (1935), were informed by his years in Whitechapel<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,1461996,00.html ''Simon Blumenfeld: Novelist, playwright, journalist and revolutionary'' 18 April 2005 (Obituary, The Guardian)] accessed 17 Nov 2007</ref>  [[Sax Rohmer]] (1883-1959) wrote fantasies set in [[Chinatown (London)|Chinatown]], Limehouse, featuring many scenes in [[opium dens]] and introducing there one the 20th centuries' master villains, [[Fu Manchu]], in a series of novels of which the first was ''[[The Mystery of Dr Fu Manchu]]'' (1913). [[Thomas Burke (author)|Thomas Burke]] (1886<U+2013>1945) explored the same territory in ''Limehouse Nights'' (1916). 

Playwrights have often located their work in the East End.  During the 1950s and 1960s, much drama was inspired and encouraged by the work of [[Joan Littlewood]] and [[Theatre Workshop]], based in the [[Theatre Royal, Stratford East]]. Their new works explored the experiences and position of their local audience. Many productions transferred both to the [[West End theatre|West End]] and were made into films. In the 1970s and 1980s the [[Half Moon Theatre]] presented premi<U+00E8>res of European works and new works by London playwrights, such as [[Edward Bond]] and [[Stephen Berkoff]].

One contemporary manifestation exploring the 'collision of worlds' made possible by the East End is the school of [[psychogeography]] espoused most prominently by [[Peter Ackroyd]] (1949- ) in such novels as ''Hawksmoor'' (1985) and ''Dan Leno and the Limehouse Golem'' (1994) and [[Iain Sinclair]] (1943- ) in such novels as ''White Chappell, Scarlet Tracings'' (1987). A more realistic fictionalisation on the contemporary [[gentrification]] of the area, and the rise of the [[yuppie]], is provided by [[Penelope Lively]] in ''[[Passing On]]'' (1989) and ''[[City of the Mind]]'' (1991) and by [[P. D. James]] in ''[[Original Sin (novel)|Original Sin]]'' (1994). Emblematic of the current world-wide [[clash of civilisations]] between West and East, of which the East End has historically been a microcosm, are  [[Monica Ali]]'s (1967- ) novel ''[[Brick Lane]]'' (2003), and [[Salman Rushdie]]'s  fantastic and controversial ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' (1988) which also uses Brick Lane as a location.<ref name=lit>Ed Glinert (2000) ''A Literary Guide to London'': 244-262</ref>

===TV=== 
''[[EastEnders]]'', a [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] broadcast since 1985, is set in the fictional [[London Borough of Walford]]. The programme is actually filmed at a purpose-built set at the [[Elstree Studios]] in [[Hertfordshire]], and the paradigms for the show are thought to lie beyond the East End, in [[Stratford]] and [[Walthamstow]]. In that, the programme does represent the diaspora of East Enders who have moved out of the district, and draws on the themes of family and social integration. An earlier programme, ''[[Til Death Us Do Part]]'' (1965&ndash;1975) attempted to satirise the stereotypical attitudes of an East Ender, [[Alf Garnett]], played by [[Warren Mitchell]]. The locale for this programme has been variously placed in [[Wapping]] and [[West Ham]], with the principal character a supporter of [[West Ham United F.C.]]. The comedic theme of the programme was the interaction between members of the family, and the inability of the principal character to adapt to the rapid changes in his world.  The piece inspired the hit American remake ''[[All in the Family]]'', among others.

===Film===
Film has also explored the issues and themes affecting the East End. Many early films were made in Hoxton, at [[Gainsborough Studios]]. With their association with German cinema realism, many of these were made in the streets around the studio. 

In more modern films, gangsterism has featured. ''[[Sparrers Can't Sing]]'' (1962),<ref>{{imdb title|id=0057521|title=Sparrows Can't Sing (1962)}}</ref> developed by Theatre Workshop, dealt with issues of change in the East End - a sailor comes home from the sea, to find his home redeveloped and his family moved to a new council block. The sets were often visited by local gangsters, the Krays, who actually made a cameo appearance in the film.<ref>[http://www.jamesbooth.org/reviews/sparrows_cant_sing.htm ''Sparrers Can't Sing - film review''] accessed 5 May 2007</ref> The ''[[The Long Good Friday]]'' (1980) develops the same themes of change, with a gangster seeking legitimacy in the redevelopment of Docklands. His brutality is only matched by that of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]].<ref>{{imdb title|id=0081070|title=The Long Good Friday(1980)}}</ref>

The theme of a return to find a changing society is also brought out in ''[[For Queen and Country]]'' (1989).<ref>{{imdb title|id=0097373|title=For Queen and Country}}</ref> ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]'' (1998) again explores gangsterism, with change represented by amateur white collar criminals.  Conflict arises between them and old firm criminals, immigrant gangsters and a group of less than honest friends, raised in the East End.<ref>{{imdb title|id=0120735|title=Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998)}}</ref>

Romantic encounters with a multi-cultural erotic frisson in Limehouse's Chinatown are the theme of such films as ''[[Broken Blossoms]]'' (1919), derived from a story in Thomas Burke's ''Limehouse Nights'' and ''[[Piccadilly (film)|Piccadilly]]'' (1929) starring [[Anna May Wong]] as an alluring Chinese nightclub performer.<ref>{{imdb title|id=0020269|title=Piccadilly (1929)}}</ref> Limehouse is also the scene of the Fu Manchu films. These began with some short British serials of the 1920's before the first American feature film ''[[The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu]]'' appeared in 1929, followed by many others<ref>{{imdb title|id=0023194|title=The Mask of Fu Manchu (1932)}}</ref>

Further multi-cultural encounters are featured in the film ''Brick Lane'' (2007) based on Monica Ali's novel.<ref>{{imdb title|id=0940585|title=Brick Lane (2007)}}</ref>
