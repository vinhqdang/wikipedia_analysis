{{nihongo|'''Link'''|<U+30EA><U+30F3><U+30AF>|Rinku}} is a [[fictional character]] and the main [[protagonist]] from [[Nintendo]]'s [[The Legend of Zelda (series)|''The Legend of Zelda'' series]]. Created by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], ''The Legend of Zelda'' is one of Nintendo's flagship game franchises, which sold over 47 million copies worldwide [[as of 2007]].<ref>{{cite web|author=David|publisher=Australia's PAL Gaming Network|year=2005|url=http://palgn.com.au/article.php?id=3605&sid=4cea9e5e814470cb7ea6fd462d04a13e|title=Nintendo reveal sales figures|accessdate=2006-02-12}}</ref> The series' enduring popularity has led to many incarnations of the ''Zelda'' story and of Link himself; the character's first appearance was in the game ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]''. Link has been featured in other [[video game]]s from Nintendo, including its merchandising, [[comic book]]s, and an [[The Legend of Zelda (TV series)|animated television program]]. Link was awarded with a star on the [[Walk of Game]] in 2005, alongside [[Mario]] and [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]].<ref name="walk">{{cite web| url = http://www.walkofgame.com/inductees/inductees2005.html| title = Past Inductees| work=WalkOfGame.com| publisher = [[Metreon]]| accessdate = 2007-12-20}}</ref>

Link is described as a young [[Races in The Legend of Zelda series#Hylia|Hylian]] boy from the fictional land of [[Hyrule]]. His age varies depending on the game; incarnations usually vary from pre-teen to the late teens. Link often journeys through the realm of Hyrule defeating evil forces and Hyrule's nemesis, [[Ganon]]. To defeat Ganon, Link usually requires the mystical [[Master Sword]] and Light Arrows, or some other similar legendary weapon, obtained after many trials and battles gathering magical objects or using other items such as musical instruments and assorted weaponry.  

==Creation and conception==
Link has almost no spoken dialogue in the game series. Facial expression has only been visible since the series appeared on the [[Nintendo 64]]. Miyamoto has said in interviews that his conceptualization of ''The Legend of Zelda'', and of Link, was based on his childhood memories of books, movies, stories and personal experiences. He tried to make people identify with Link and have the opportunity to be heroes like the character. Although at the end of some games Link becomes vastly talented in physical and magical arts, he usually starts off the game as a regular boy. For example, in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'', he begins as an orphan, and ends as the legendary "Hero of Time".<ref name="origin"/>

===Character development===
There have been several iterations of Link in the history of Hyrule. The existence of multiple Links is made obvious on many occasions in the games; for example, the introduction sequence of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]]'' refers to an ancient, legendary champion who is identical in appearance to Link, and directly mentions the "Hero of Time" (a title given to Link in ''Ocarina of Time'') as a historical entity. Link and [[Princess Zelda]] are reincarnations or descendants of the same two people. However, Ganondorf, the main villain, is always the same person. Miyamoto has stated, "For every ''Zelda'' game we tell a new story, but we actually have an enormous document that explains how the game relates to the others, and bind them together. But to be honest, they are not that important to us. We care more about developing the game system ... give the player new challenges for every chapter that is born."<ref name="origin">{{cite web|url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/230403.shtml|title=Shigeru Miyamoto Interview|date=[[2003-04-23]]|publisher=Superplay Magazine|author=Superplay Editorial Staff|accessdate=2006-09-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.digitaltrends.com/featured_article58.html|title=Gaming Legend Shigeru Miyamoto Speaks|date=[[2006-06-19]]|publisher=Digital Trends|author=Chris Zimmerman|accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref> However, the exact [[chronology]] of the ''Zelda'' series and the lineage of the various Links, though written down by Miyamoto and his team, has never been released in detail.<ref name="creation">{{cite web|author=Chris Leyton|publisher=Total Video Games.com|year=[[2003]]-[[02-26]]|url=http://www.totalvideogames.com/news/The_Miyamoto_Interview_3946_0_1.htm|title=The Miyamoto Interview|accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref> Some major [[fansite]]s have attempted to construct a coherent ''Zelda'' timeline based on available data, but with little success.<ref>{{cite web|author=Cory Faller|publisher=N-Sider|date=2005-01-01|url=http://www.n-sider.com/articleview.php?articleid=248&page=1|title=The Legends of Zelda|accessdate=2006-09-28}}</ref> After the release of ''Ocarina of Time'', Miyamoto stated it was the first story in the timeline, then ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]'', and finally ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'', with ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening]]'' occurring sometime after ''Ocarina of Time''.<ref>{{cite web|author=|publisher=''[[Nintendo Power]]''|date=1998-11-19|url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/111998.shtml|title=Miyamoto Interview|accessdate=2006-10-07}}</ref>

On the design of Link in ''The Wind Waker'', Miyamoto explained, "Link was a young boy and trying to create a very active and very energetic young boy and trying to choose the right style for portraying the young boy in a game like that we tried many different experiments. The ultimate decision we came to was that the cel-shading in ''The Wind Waker'' was the best option for expressing that."<ref name="Eree">{{cite web|author=IGN Staff|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2004-05-12|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/514/514589p1.html|title=E3 2004: Miyamoto and Aonuma on Zelda|accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref> ''The Wind Waker'' takes place with a new Link centuries after the victory of Link in ''Ocarina of Time''.<ref>{{cite web|author=|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=2004-05-12|url=http://www.gamecubicle.com/interview-legend_of_zelda_wind_waker_miyamoto.htm|title=Windwaker interview|accessdate=2006-09-28}}</ref> ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess|Twilight Princess]]'' does not incorporate the idea of young Link growing up to a teenage Link.<ref name="Eree">{{cite web|author=IGN Staff|publisher=IGN|year=[[2004]]-[[05-12]]|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/514/514589p1.html|title=E3 2004: Miyamoto and Aonuma on Zelda|accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref>

===Actor portrayal===
In the 3D games, beginning with ''Ocarina of Time'', Link was voiced by four actors; [[Nobuyuki Hiyama]] for adult Link, [[Fujiko Takimoto]] for young Link, [[Sachi Matsumoto]] as Link in ''The Wind Waker'' and [[Akira Sasanuma]] in ''Twilight Princess''. As no ''Zelda'' game to date has contained substantial spoken dialogue, the part consists only of short phrases, grunts, battle cries, and other sounds.<ref name="staff">{{cite web|url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/0898.shtml|title=Miyamoto Interview|date=[[1998-08-01]]|publisher=''Nintendo Power''|author=Nintendo Power Editorial Staff|accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref> In ''The Wind Waker'', however, Link has been heard saying the phrase, "Come on!". [[Voice acting]] in the series has been deliberately limited as to not "contradict players' individual interpretations of the character".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/0898.shtml|title=Miyamoto and Aonuma Interview|date=[[2002-12-04]]|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Editorial Staff|accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
According to the official Zelda.com Encyclopedia, Link is "humble", but possesses legendary bravery, an attribute consistent with his role as the rightful bearer of the [[Triforce#Triforce of Courage|Triforce of Courage]]. The character is known in later ''Zelda'' games as "The Hero of Time" in his ''Ocarina of Time''/''Majora's Mask'' incarnation, and as the "Hero of Winds" in ''The Wind Waker''/''Phantom Hourglass''.<ref name="pedia"/> In the games and in various [[comics]] he is presented as being a stoic and polite person, and in the television series as a smart alec, lovesick teenager.

He is the rightful bearer of the Master Sword, a powerful and [[Magic sword|magical sword]] he wields to defeat the forces of evil. Link shows rare moments of overzealous boldness, such as when he twice attempts to confront Ganon in ''The Wind Waker'', ill-equipped to defeat him, and when he almost plummets off a cliff when trying to save his sister from a giant bird in the beginning of the game. He challenged Ganondorf as a child to protect Zelda before he inadvertently helped Ganondorf find the [[Triforce]] in ''Ocarina of Time'', forcing Link to undo the damage he had caused.<ref name="pedia">{{cite web | url=http://www.zelda.com/universe/pedia/l.jsp |author= Nintendo| title=The Great Hyrule Encyclopedia - Link | publisher=Zelda Universe |year=[[2006]]-[[01-01]]| accessdate=2005-09-20}}</ref> Although Zelda games feature more interaction with friendly or neutral non-player characters (NPCs) than some adventure games, such as the [[Metroid (series)|''Metroid'' series]], these characters rarely take an active part in Link's quest which he completes alone. Link is shown to have several family members, such as an uncle in ''A Link to the Past'', an unseen mother in ''Ocarina of Time'' who died fleeing the ravages of war when Link was a baby, a grandmother in ''The Wind Waker'' who raises him in his parents unexplained absence, a grandfather in ''The Minish Cap'', and the most developed of Link's relatives, his sister Aryll, who plays a critical role in the plot of ''The Wind Waker''. No incarnations of Link, however, has ever been shown to have a living mother or father by the time of the character's adventures. He has several friends, such as the pirate captain Tetra from ''The Wind Waker'', Kafei and Tatl from ''Majora's Mask'', and the fairy [[List of characters in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time#Navi|Navi]] from ''Ocarina of Time''. He has a [[utilitarian]] relationship with [[List of characters in The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess#Midna|Midna]] from ''Twilight Princess'', though the two grow to become friends as time goes on.<ref name="gamein">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200505/N05.0525.1742.45225.htm|last=Berghammer|first=Billy|title=Zelda's Twilight Prince: The Eiji Aonuma Interview|publisher=Game Informer|date=[[2005-05-25]]|accessdate=2006-09-24}}</ref> His mother and father appear as spirits in [[manga]] from the [[media franchise]].<ref name="manga"/>

Link is a young Hylian boy and is renowned for his swordsmanship and fighting skill, such as his boomerang accuracy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zelda.com/universe/pedia/b.jsp|author=Nintendo|year=[[2006]]-[[01-01]]|title=The Great Hyrule Encyclopedia - Boomerang|publisher=Zelda Universe|accessdate=2005-09-11}}</ref> It is stated, though, in ''The Adventure of Link'', Links starts the game on his sixteenth birthday. Every Link wears a green tunic, an under-shirt (usually white, brown, or green, also, in ''Twilight Princess'', he wore what appears to be chain mail, rather than an undershirt), and a long green cap, at least for part of each adventure (usually for the vast majority), although the shades of green vary. It is a common sight to see him wearing light-colored tights (usually white or tan), although he has appeared barelegged in other games. Link has long pointed ears, a distinctive trait of the Hylian race (and their descendants), which supposedly allows them to hear messages from the gods. In the ''Zelda'' trading cards released by Nintendo early on in the series, it is stated that the pointed ears are a sign of the royal family. Older Links usually wear small blue hoop earrings, as is the Hylian fashion. However, in episode 4 of the Adult Saga in the official ''Ocarina of Time'' manga series, "Link Vs. Link", Impa is seen giving a Link his earrings, describing it as a "rite of passage for young [[Sheikah]] men".<ref>{{cite web|author=|publisher=zeldalegacy.net|year=[[2006]]-[[01-01]]|url=http://zeldalegacy.net/cpg/thumbnails.php?album=71|title=Chapter 10 - Link vs. Link|accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref> He bears a Triforce mark on his left hand, marking him as the one who will find the Triforce of Courage.<ref name = "iiinstructions"/> He is well known for making use of a variety of weapons and items, such as [[Bomb]]s, the Hookshot, the [[Boomerang]], [[Bow (weapon)|Bow and arrow]], and Pegasus Boots. He is physically powerful, able to overpower Ganondorf in blade to blade combat despite Ganondorf's far greater size. He is extremely nimble, being able to perform quick jumps and flips, and very skilled, knowing how to perform magic and play many different instruments. When he transforms into an animal in the twilight realm in ''Twilight Princess'', he becomes a wolf, reflecting the mystical aspects of the transformation and his heroism.<ref name="gamein"/>

[[Canon (fiction)|Canon]]ically, Link is [[left-handed]], although this detail has changed over time, with his sword hand being different between games. The ''Adventure of Link'' instruction booklet describes Link setting off "with a magical sword in his left hand and a magical shield in his right".<ref name="iiinstructions">{{cite book|year=1997|editor=Nintendo|title=Zelda II: The Adventure of Link instruction manual|pages=|publisher=Nintendo|language=English|id=}}</ref> In ''A Link to the Past'', he alternates hands, but this is due to sprite mirroring. Starting with ''Link's Awakening'', Link holds his sword in his left hand and his shield in his right, no matter what direction he is facing. This occurs in the left and right-looking sprites. In ''The Minish Cap'', however, Link returns to alternately holding his weapon in the right or the left hand, depending on his orientation. At the beginning of the ''Four Swords Plus'' (''Four Swords Adventures'') manga, Link is referred to as the "left-handed hero" after defeating pirates that were raiding a Hylian town. In addition, Link's figurine description in ''The Wind Waker'' lists his "manual preference" as left. However, in the animated TV series, Link is [[right-handed]]. In the [[Wii]] version of ''Twilight Princess'' Link is right-handed, but this was done to better mirror the game's control scheme. In the game's official artwork he is shown holding his sword in his left hand. In the [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]] version Link remains left-handed since the game uses a traditional control scheme.<ref name="miyamoto right link">{{cite web|last=Casamassina|first=Matt|authorlink=Matt Casamassina|date=[[2006-09-20]]|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/733/733762p1.html|title=Miyamoto Talks Righty Link|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref>

Link debuted in February 21, 1986, with the release of the video game ''The Legend of Zelda'' in [[Japan]]. Described as a "young lad" who saved Princess Zelda's elderly nursemaid [[Recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#Impa|Impa]] from Ganon's henchmen,<ref>Nintendo (1997). ''The Legend of Zelda'' instruction manual (in English). [http://zeldaclassic.armageddongames.net/walkthroughs/zeldamanual.txt]</ref> Link assumes the role of the generic hero attempting to rescue Princess Zelda (and the kingdom of Hyrule) from the evil wizard Ganon, who has stolen the [[Triforce#Triforce of Power|Triforce of Power]].

In ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]'', Link approaches his sixteenth birthday. Impa takes him to North Castle in Hyrule, alarmed by the sudden appearance of a Triforce crest on the boy's left hand. She shows him the true heiress of Hyrule, an older incarnation of Princess Zelda, trapped in an eternal sleep, lying on an altar in the castle. The old woman tells Link of the Legend of Zelda, an ancient tale about the division of the Triforce and the curse that was put upon the older princess. Impa then gives Link six crystals, and a scroll written in an ancient Hylian language, which Link understands despite having never learned it. He reads that the mark on his hand is the sign that he was chosen to seek the third Triforce, the [[Triforce#Triforce of Courage|Triforce of Courage]], in the Great Palace in the Valley of Death. Link then begins a quest to place a crystal in each of six palaces in Hyrule, so that he can later penetrate unhindered into the magically protected Great Palace, claim the Triforce of Courage, reunite the three pieces of the Triforce, and awaken Zelda.<ref>{{cite book|year=1989|editor=Nintendo|title=''The Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link''|pages=3<U+2013>12|publisher=Nintendo|language=English|id=}}</ref>

''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'' tells the story of how, centuries before the events of ''The Legend of Zelda'', Ganon and his army of evil were banished into the Golden Land, the realm of the Triforce, by the Hylians, at the price of countless lives. The [[Portal (fiction)|portal]] to this world was magically blocked by seven sages, and the lands behind that seal, which Hylians hoped would never be broken again, became known as the Dark World, as they were corrupted by Ganon's malice. The struggle to seal Ganon in the Golden Land became known as the Imprisoning War. One day, when the Imprisoning War had been all but forgotten, the land is plagued by sudden disaster, until the wizard [[Recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#Agahnim|Agahnim]] appears at the court of the king of Hyrule and quells the upheaval. Named chief adviser to the throne, he soon seizes power from the king and kidnaps six maidens, descendants of the wise men who had sealed the entrance of the Dark World. The maidens are taken to the castle tower, and never seen again. Agahnim then begins a dark ritual to break the seal on the Dark World and unleash Ganon's fury upon Hyrule. Princess Zelda herself descends from the seventh sage, and manages to send out a [[Telepathy|telepathic]] call for help before being taken away. Link's uncle heads for the royal castle first, but he is quickly defeated. He leaves Link his sword and with his last breath imparts the sword-spin technique. The young hero then begins a journey to collect three magical Pendants of Virtue, and claim the Master Sword as his before facing Agahnim.

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'', a young Link has been raised as one of the [[Races in The Legend of Zelda series#Kokiri|Kokiri]], a child-like race of forest dwellers. He is summoned to the [[List of characters in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time#Great Deku Tree|Great Deku Tree]], the forest's guardian, who tells Link a curse cast by Ganondorf has killed him. The Deku Tree tells Link of the Triforce and directs Link to [[Hyrule#Hyrule Castle|Hyrule Castle]], where he encounters Princess Zelda; she proceeds to ask him to collect the three Spiritual Stones and save Hyrule. Link does this, and travels to the Temple of Time, acquiring the Master Sword. This action imprisons Link unconscious in the [[Sacred Realm]] for seven years, while Ganondorf takes control of Hyrule and seizes the Triforce of Power. Seven years after drawing the sword from the pedestal, Link is awakened as the Hero of Time by Rauru, Sage of Light. He sets off to cleanse the land of Ganondorf's evil by awakening the seven Sages, who can seal Ganondorf in what used to be the Sacred Realm. Returning to the Kokiri Forest, he finds none of his friends have grown up, and most no longer recognize him. After the player completes the first dungeon in this phase of the game, the Deku Tree's successor, the Deku Sprout, reveals Link's past to him. The Kokiri never grow up; the reason Link has grown is because he is actually a Hylian, orphaned in the wars that occurred while Link was a baby.<ref>'''Deku Tree Sprout:''' Well, as you might have already guessed, you are not a Kokiri!

''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask]]'' occurs after Link defeats Ganon and is sent back in time to his childhood. Link leaves Hyrule to search for a lost friend (declared by the [[Manga from The Legend of Zelda series|manga]] to be his old fairy companion, Navi). While riding in the [[Hyrule#Lost Woods|Lost Woods]], he is ambushed by a [[Races in The Legend of Zelda series#Skull Kid|Skull Kid]] who is possessed by an evil artifact, Majora's Mask, and his horse, [[Recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#Epona|Epona]], is stolen. Chasing the Skull Kid, Link falls into a crevasse and arrives in a country called [[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask#Setting|Termina]]. He must save this land from the evil of Majora's Mask, which has drawn the moon into a decaying orbit, threatening to crash into Termina's primary city, Clock Town, in three days. Link uses the Ocarina of Time to play the Song of Time, which sends him back in time and saves the game when he plays it, to relive these three days repeatedly in order to prevent the disaster. Along the way, Link finds many magical masks of his own, a handful of which allow him to transform. Those masks can turn him into a rock-like [[Races in The Legend of Zelda series#Goron tribe|Goron]]; a petite, plant-like [[Races in The Legend of Zelda series#Deku|Deku Scrub]]; a graceful, aquatic [[Races in The Legend of Zelda series#Zora tribe|Zora]]; or the "Fierce Deity". In this game, Link never grows up in the traditional sense, but the dark power of the Fierce Deity's Mask allows Link to assume a powerful adult-like form, "Fierce Deity Link". This form is similar to adult Link in ''Ocarina of Time''. Miyamoto mentioned that "we wanted Link to get inside of a wonderland, to experience the adventures and think hard about what he should do."<ref>{{cite web|author=Kris|publisher=GG8|year=[[2000]]-[[11-12]]|url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/111200.shtml|title=Miyamoto Interview|accessdate=2006-09-24}}</ref>

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages|The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons]]'', the Triforce sends Link on a mission to another land, Holodrum, to stop the disruption of the seasons by the General of Darkness, [[List of characters in The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and Seasons#Onox|Onox]]. While there, it is his duty to protect the Oracle of Seasons, who is a dancer named Din. After Onox takes her by force and the seasons are thrown into chaos, Link sets out to rescue her with the aid of the Rod of Seasons, a magical staff which allows Link to control the four seasons.

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages|The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages]]'', Link awakens in another land, Labrynna, where he has been sent by the magic of the Triforce. Upon his arrival he is tricked by [[List of characters in The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and Seasons#Veran|Veran]], the Sorceress of Shadows, into opening the seal protecting the Oracle of Ages, a singer named Nayru. Veran, possessing Nayru's body and time-traveling powers, goes back in time to change the past and command the present. Link rushes to follow them to the past and save Nayru using the power of the Harp of Ages, which, when played correctly, grants its user the ability to move back and forth through time. After exorcising Veran's spirit from Nayru's body, Link ascends her citadel to defeat Veran.

After playing through both games (in either order), by use of a password obtained at the end of the first game played, it is revealed that the events of both games are part of a sinister plot by [[Recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#Twinrova|Twinrova]] to light the flames of Destruction (lit by the actions of Onox), Sorrow (lit by the actions of Veran), and Despair (lit when Zelda is kidnapped) as part of a ritual to resurrect Ganon. To complete the ritual, the sacrifice of a pure-hearted individual is required. In the end, Link must save Zelda from this fate. Link defeats the Twinrova and saves Zelda, but the Twinrova sacrifice themselves to resurrect a mindless Ganon and Link must fight him anyway.

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past#A Link to the Past & Four Swords|The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords]]'', Zelda goes to the Sanctuary of the Four Sword with her friend, Link, to check on the seal containing the evil Wind Mage, [[Vaati]]. The seal has weakened, however, and Vaati emerges, kidnaps Zelda, and knocks out Link. Link awakens to find three fairies, who instruct him to draw the Four Sword. The magical Four Sword divides him into 2<U+2013>4 identical Links (depending on the number of players). The first Link wears his traditional green outfit; the second, a red version; the third, blue; and the fourth purple. In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap]]'', released later, it is revealed that these colors reflect the four [[classical element|elements]] with which the sword is imbued: earth, fire, water, then wind.

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]]'', set centuries after ''Ocarina of Time'', the gods have flooded Hyrule, creating the Great Sea, encompassing the highest mountaintops of Hyrule. At the beginning of the game, Link's younger sister [[List of characters in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker#Aryll|Aryll]] is captured by the [[Bosses in The Legend of Zelda series#Helmaroc King|Helmaroc King]], a giant masked bird controlled by the game's primary [[antagonist]] Ganondorf, the latter of whom is searching for Princess Zelda. Link travels the Great Sea to rescue his sister and defeat the Helmaroc King; his quest intertwining with that of [[List of characters in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker#King Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule (The King of Red Lions)|The King of Red Lions]], who reveals, after many trials, that Link is the "Hero of Winds". Using the Wind Waker, a magical [[Baton (conducting)|conductor's baton]], he borrows the power of the gods to aid him in his quest. The wand's user interface is similar to that of the Ocarina of Time, but uses [[tempo]] and [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] to form tunes. Link must eventually reassemble the Triforce of Courage to give him the power to fight Ganondorf.

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures]]'', Zelda, who is again worried about the seal on Vaati, goes with six other mystical maidens to check on the Sanctuary of the Four Sword, with Link accompanying her. However, a dark, shadowy copy of Link attacks. Link is forced to draw the Four Sword to fight this [[Recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#Dark Link|Shadow Link]], but when he does, he once again splits into copies of himself, and Vaati escapes.<ref>{{cite web|author=''Nintendo Power''|publisher=Nintendo.com|year=[[2004]]-[[06-07]]|url=http://www.nintendo.com/gamemini?gameid=m-Game-0000-1849&rp=1|title=The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure|accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref>{{Dead link|date=July 2008}}

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap]]'', set before ''Four Swords'' and ''Four Swords Adventures'', Link is a young boy living with his grandfather, the Master Smith of Hyrule. Link is a childhood friend of Princess Zelda, and on the day of Hyrule's yearly fair to celebrate the coming of the [[Races in The Legend of Zelda series#Minish|Picori]], they go to join in the festivities. A mysterious stranger, [[Recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#Vaati|Vaati]], shows up and wins the sword-fighting competition; each year the victor of this tournament has the honor of touching the sacred Picori Blade. This sword was a gift to the Hylians from the tiny Picori and was used long ago by a legendary hero to defeat the forces of darkness and seal them away in the Bound Chest. Vaati destroys the blade and curses Zelda, and it is up to Link to repair the sword, defeat Vaati and save the princess.<ref>{{cite book|year=2004|editor=Nintendo|title=The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap|pages=3<U+2013>4|publisher=Nintendo|language=English|id=}}</ref> By the end of the game, the Picori Blade becomes the Four Sword, which Link seals Vaati in, setting the scene for the previously released ''Four Swords'' games.

Link<U+2019>s rescue mission leads him into the Twilight Realm, a dark place that changes him into a wolf. While in this form, he is aided by [[List of characters in The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess#Midna|Midna]], an imp-like creature, and learns why the Twilight invaded this world from Princess Zelda. Yet, in his attempt to save his friends, Link discovers an even greater evil only he can stop. During the game, Link travels in the normal world in his human form and in the Twilight Realm in his wolf form.

''[[The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass]]'', the latest title in the series, was released on June 23, 2007, in Japan and on October 1, 2007, in [[North America]]. It revives the use of a fairy companion as in ''Ocarina of Time'' and ''Majora's Mask''. A direct sequel to ''The Wind Waker'', it stars the same Link, in a quest to reunite with Tetra after she is lost to the mysterious Ghost Ship.

''[[Link's Crossbow Training]]'', a [[spin-off]] of the series, has Link attempting to become more proficient with the crossbow.

===Non-''Zelda'' appearances===
Link is present in a number of games outside the ''Zelda'' series. While varying in their regard within the gaming community, none of these games contribute anything to the series which would be considered ''The Legend of Zelda'' [[canon (fiction)|canon]].

''[[Link: The Faces of Evil]]'', released in 1993 for [[Philips]]' [[CD-i]] system, is the only one of the three Zelda games for the CD-i system in which Link is the protagonist. At the beginning of the game, Link is visited by a wizard who tells him that Ganon and his servants have seized the peaceful island of Koridai and captured Zelda. After being informed that only he can defeat Ganon, Link travels to Koridai to find the magical artifact known as the ''Book of Koridai''. Using the Book, he defeats Ganon and frees Zelda. Although it features ''Zelda'' characters, this game was not produced, nor supervised by Nintendo, which does not officially recognize the game as part of the ''Zelda'' series.

There were two other ''The Legend of Zelda'' games released for the CD-i: ''[[Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon]]'' and ''[[Zelda's Adventure]]''. However, in both games Princess Zelda was the protagonist, as in both games the plot involves Link<U+2019>s kidnapping.

Link is one of eight characters available at the beginning of Nintendo's 1999 fighting game, ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]''. Link sports his traditional green Kokiri tunic and the player can choose from several other tunic colors. He has some of his arsenal from the ''Zelda'' games, including bombs, boomerang and a hookshot. Link is one of the 15 playable characters available from the start in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', the 2001 sequel to ''Super Smash Bros.''. In ''Melee'', he has his bow in addition to the equipment he brought with him to the original ''Super Smash Bros.''. Also playable in the game, as a secret unlockable character, is "Young Link", the youthful version of the aforementioned fighter. Modeled after the ''Ocarina of Time'' version of the hero, Young Link is more agile but weaker than the older Link. Link became one of the first confirmed fighters in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' for the Wii. His appearance was influenced by his character model from ''Twilight Princess''. "Toon Link", a version of Link based on his cel-shaded appearance in ''The Wind Waker'', is also a playable character in ''Brawl''.<ref>{{cite web|posted by=Orland, Kyle|publisher=Joystiq|year=[[2008]]-[[01-29]]|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/01/29/super-spoiler-bros-brawl-major-leaked-roster-update-videos-a/|title=Super Spoiler Bros. Brawl: Major leaked roster update, videos & more|accessdate=2008-01-29}}</ref>

In the GameCube version of [[Namco]]'s ''[[Soulcalibur II]]'', the [[List of minor Soul series characters#Link|adult-style Link]] is a playable fighter. Little is revealed about the incarnation of Link in this game, but it is known that after saving Hyrule from an evil wizard who was being controlled by a fragment of Soul Edge, he went on a quest to destroy the evil sword. Quickly pulling the Master Sword out of its pedestal, he set out to travel to this world to destroy Soul Edge, on a secret mission arranged by Princess Zelda. Miyamoto did not see a problem with Link appearing in what some had thought to be a "violent fighting game", as he had already been established as a fighter in the ''Super Smash Bros.'' games.<ref name="creation">{{cite web|author=Chris Leyton|publisher=Total Video Games.com|year=[[2003]]-[[02-26]]|url=http://www.totalvideogames.com/news/The_Miyamoto_Interview_3946_0_1.htm|title=The Miyamoto Interview [News ]|accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref> The more realistic Link in this game was used to develop ''Twilight Princess'''s Link.<ref>{{cite web|author=|publisher=Computer and Video Games|year=[[2003]]-[[05-16]]|url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/140503.shtml|title=The Miyamoto Interview|accessdate=2006-09-24}}</ref> Link is the only character in ''Soulcalibur II'' to use ranged weapons and the only guest character to have his own music theme and more than two costumes. He uses a number of items from the ''Zelda'' series.

Link was also intended to appear in ''[[Marvel Ultimate Alliance]]'', but never did.<ref>[http://www.siliconera.com/2008/02/06/lost-cameo-meet-ultimate-alliance-link/ Siliconera <U+00BB> Lost cameo, Meet Ultimate Alliance Link<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Cameo appearances===
Among [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] games, Link makes a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''[[Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars]]'' where he is seen [[The Legend of Zelda (series)#Cultural influence|sleeping in a bed at an inn]]. Another reference to Link is in the Japanese version of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]''; in Elftown there is a grave marked "Here Lies Link". It was changed to a grave for Erdrick from ''[[Dragon Warrior]]'' when translated to English; however, this grave was changed back to Link in the [[Game Boy Advance]] version. He appears in ''[[Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!]]'', with a reference to Link's collection of seashells from ''Link's Awakening''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Fryguy64|publisher=Nintendo Database|year=[[2006]]-[[01-01]]|url=http://nindb.classicgaming.gamespy.com/sns/a3c.shtml|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070224115102/http://nindb.classicgaming.gamespy.com/sns/a3c.shtml|archivedate=2007-02-24|title=Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble|accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref> Some of Link's weapons and items have appeared in several games, such as the Master Sword in ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]''<ref>{{cite web|author=Paden Brown|publisher=gamewinners.com|year=[[2006]]-[[01-01]]|url=http://www.gamewinners.com/game_boy_advance/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance.htm|title=Hint: Legend Of Zelda reference: |accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref> and ''[[Animal Crossing]]'', and the warp whistle in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''.

[[Image:Zeed2.jpg|thumb|Link, as he appeared in the [[The Legend of Zelda (TV series)|''Zelda'' TV series]]]]
In the ''Zelda'' animated series, Link, voiced by [[Jonathan Potts]], was featured in a set of [[cartoon]]s which aired from 1989<U+2013>1990 as a part of [[DIC Entertainment|DIC's]] ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]''. Based loosely on the first game, the cartoons presented Link as a rude, lovesick teenager. Constantly pursuing Zelda and pursued by the fairy princess Spryte, he begged kisses from Zelda, and exclaimed "Well excuuuuuse me, Princess!" when tired with her attitude. Thirteen episodes were produced before the cancellation of ''The Super Mario Bros. Super Show''.<ref>{{cite web|author=|publisher=zeldalegacy.net|year=[[2006]]-[[01-01]]|url=http://zeldalegacy.net/zelda-cartoons.php|title= Legend of Zelda Cartoon Series & Downloads|accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref> The complete series was released on October 18, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|author=Matt|publisher=X-Entertainment|year=[[2001]]-[[05-26]]|url=http://www.x-entertainment.com/messages/562.html|title=Captain N, The Game Master: Joins Link & Zelda For A Little Moblin Action in Hyrule!|accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref> A slightly altered version of this Link (and Zelda) appeared during the second season of ''[[Captain N: The Game Master]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael S.

A serial comic was created for [[Nintendo Power|''Nintendo Power'' magazine]] by acclaimed author [[Shotaro Ishinomori]], and later collected in [[graphic novel]] form. This told an alternate version of the events from ''A Link to the Past''. Though Link starts out a hapless, bumbling boy, he displays great courage and proves himself a determined and competent adventurer. He has a fairy companion, Epheremelda, long before this concept was introduced to the video games. This telling portrays Link's parents as Knights of Hyrule, lost to the Dark World. It includes an original character, Roam, a descendant of the Knights of Hyrule who fought in the Imprisoning War. At the end of the story, Zelda has become Queen, and Link is head of the Royal Guard and the Knights of Hyrule. This success is bittersweet, as their duties keep them apart, even though they were once close, sharing an adventure and even coming together in dreams.<ref name="manga">{{cite web|author=|publisher=Zelda Shrine|year=[[2006]]-[[01-01]]|url=http://zs.ffshrine.org/link-to-the-past/manga.php|title=Zelda a Link to the Past - Manga / Comics|accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref> There have been manga based on ''The Legend of Zelda'', ''Ocarina of Time'', ''Majora's Mask'', ''Oracle of Ages'', ''Oracle of Seasons'', ''Four Swords Adventures'' and ''The Minish Cap''.<ref>{{cite web|author=|publisher=Zelda Shrine|year=[[2006]]-[[01-01]]|url=http://zeldalegacy.net/zelda-manga-comics.php|title=Zelda Comics and Manga|accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref>
