'''Time''' is a component of the [[measurement|measuring system]] used to sequence events, to compare the durations of events and the intervals between them, and to quantify the motions of objects. Time has been a major subject of [[religion]], [[philosophy]], and [[science]], but defining it in a non-controversial manner applicable to all fields of study  has consistently eluded the greatest scholars.<ref name=Khayam>E.

The operational definition leaves aside the question whether there is something called time, apart from the counting activity just mentioned, that flows and that can be measured. Investigations of a single continuum called [[spacetime]] brings the nature of time into association with related questions into the nature of [[space]], questions that have their roots in the works of early students of [[natural philosophy]].

Among prominent philosophers, there are two distinct viewpoints on ''time''.
One view is that time is part of the fundamental structure of the [[universe]], a [[dimension]] in which events occur in [[sequence]]. [[Time travel]], in this view, becomes a possibility as other "times" persist like frames of a film strip, spread out across the time line. [[Sir Isaac Newton]] subscribed to this [[Philosophical realism|realist]] view, and hence it is sometimes referred to as [[Absolute time and space|Newtonian time]].<ref name=Rynasiewicz>

|quote=First of all, Leibniz finds the idea that space and time might be substances or substance-like absurd (see, for example, "Correspondence with Clarke," Leibniz's Fourth Paper, <U+00A7>8ff). In short, an empty space would be a substance with no properties; it will be a substance that even God cannot modify or destroy.... That is, space and time are internal or intrinsic features of the complete concepts of things, not extrinsic.... Leibniz's view has two major implications. First, there is no absolute location in either space or time; location is always the situation of an object or event relative to other objects and events. Second, space and time are not in themselves real (that is, not substances). Space and time are, rather, ideal. Space and time are just metaphysically illegitimate ways of perceiving certain virtual relations between substances. They are phenomena or, strictly speaking, illusions (although they are illusions that are well-founded upon the internal properties of substances).... It is sometimes convenient to think of space and time as something "out there," over and above the entities and their relations to each other, but this convenience must not be confused with reality. Space is nothing but the order of co-existent objects; time nothing but the order of successive events. This is usually called a relational theory of space and time.

|quote=What is correct in the Leibnizian view was its anti-metaphysical stance. Space and time do not exist in and of themselves, but in some sense are the product of the way we represent things.

Kant concluded "absolute space is not an object of outer sensation; it is rather a fundamental concept which first of all makes possible all such outer sensation."...Much of the argumentation pertaining to space is applicable, mutatis mutandis, to time, so I will not rehearse the arguments. As space is the form of outer intuition, so time is the form of inner intuition.... Kant claimed that time is real, it is "the real form of inner intuition."

|quote=Time, Kant argues, is also necessary as a form or condition of our intuitions of objects. The idea of time itself cannot be gathered from experience because succession and simultaneity of objects, the phenomena that would indicate the passage of time, would be impossible to represent if we did not already possess the capacity to represent objects in time.... Another way to put the point is to say that the fact that the mind of the knower makes the a priori contribution does not mean that space and time or the categories are mere figments of the imagination. Kant is an empirical realist about the world we experience; we can know objects as they appear to us. He gives a robust defense of science and the study of the natural world from his argument about the mind's role in making nature. All discursive, rational beings must conceive of the physical world as spatially and temporally unified, he argues.

holds that ''time'' is neither an event nor a thing, and thus is not itself measurable nor can it be travelled.

Temporal measurement has occupied scientists and [[technologist]]s, and was a prime motivation in [[navigation]] and [[astronomy]].
Periodic events and periodic motion have long served as standards for units of time. Examples include the apparent motion of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, the swing of a pendulum, and the beat of a heart. Currently, the international unit of time, the [[second]], is defined in terms of radiation emitted by [[caesium]] atoms (see [[#History of time measurement devices|below]]). Time is also of significant social importance, having economic value ("[[Time value of money|time is money]]") as well as personal value, due to an [[awareness]] of the limited time in each day and in [[life expectancy|human life spans]].

==Temporal measurement==
Temporal measurement, or [[chronometry]], takes two distinct period forms: the [[calendar]], a mathematical abstraction for calculating extensive periods of time,<ref name="Richards">{{cite book | title=Mapping Time: The Calendar and its History| last=Richards| first=E. G.| authorlink=| year=1998| pages=3<U+2013>5| publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> and the [[clock]], a concrete mechanism that counts the ongoing passage of time. In day-to-day life, the clock is consulted for periods less than a day, the calendar, for periods longer than a day. Increasingly, personal electronic devices display both calendars and clocks simultaneously. The number (as on a clock dial or calendar) that marks the occurrence of a specified event as to hour or date is obtained by counting from a fiducial epoch<U+2014>a central reference point.

===History of the calendar===
{{main|Calendar}}
Artifacts from the [[Palaeolithic]] suggest that the moon was used to calculate time as early as 12,000, and possibly even 30,000 [[Before Present|BP]].<ref name="Rudgley">{{cite book | title=The Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age| last=Rudgley| first=Richard| authorlink=Richard Rudgley| year=1999| pages=86<U+2013>105| publisher=Simon & Schuster| location=New York}}</ref>

The [[Sumer]]ian civilization of approximately 2000 BC introduced the [[sexagesimal]] system based on the number 60. 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour <U+2013> and possibly a calendar with 360 (60x6) days in a year (with a few more days added on).
Twelve also features prominently, with roughly 12 hours of day and 12 of night, and 12 months in a year (with 12 being 1/5 of 60).<!--- use of 60 could not have appeared until people started using minutes - which they would not have done with sundials ---> 

The reforms of [[Julius Caesar]] in 45 BC put the [[Roman Empire|Roman world]] on a [[solar calendar]]. This [[Julian calendar]] was faulty in that its [[intercalation]] still allowed the astronomical [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es to advance against it by about 11 minutes per year. [[Pope Gregory XIII]] introduced a correction in 1582; the [[Gregorian calendar]] was only slowly adopted by different nations over a period of centuries, but is today the one in most common use around the world.

===History of time measurement devices===
[[Image:Sundial Taganrog.jpg|thumb|right|Horizontal [[sundial]] in [[Taganrog]] (1833)]]
{{main|History of timekeeping devices}}{{seealso|Clock}}

A large variety of [[Measuring instrument|device]]s have been invented to measure time. The study of these devices is called [[horology]].

An [[Egypt]]ian device dating to c.1500 BC, similar in shape to a bent [[T-square]], measured the passage of time from the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The T was oriented eastward in the mornings. At [[noon]], the device was turned around so that it could cast its shadow in the evening direction.<ref>Barnett, Jo Ellen ''Time's Pendulum: The Quest to Capture Time<U+2014>from Sundials to Atomic Clocks'' Plenum, 1998 ISBN 0-306-45787-3 p.28</ref>

A [[sundial]] uses a [[gnomon]] to cast a shadow on a set of markings which were calibrated to the [[hour]]. The position of the shadow marked the hour in [[local time]].

The most precise timekeeping devices of the ancient world were the [[water clock]] or ''clepsydra'',  one of which was found in the tomb of Egyptian pharaoh [[Amenhotep I]] (1525<U+2013>1504 BC). They could be used to measure the hours even at night, but required manual timekeeping to replenish the flow of water. The [[Greeks]] and [[Chaldeans]] regularly maintained timekeeping records as an essential part of their astronomical observations. Arab inventors and engineers in particular made improvements on the use of water clocks up to the Middle Ages.<ref>Barnett, ''ibid'', p.37</ref> In the 11th century, the [[List of Chinese inventions|Chinese inventors]] and [[History of science and technology in China|engineers]] invented the first mechanical clocks to be driven by an [[escapement]] mechanism.

[[Image:Swatch Irony angle below.jpg|thumb|left|A contemporary [[quartz watch]]]]
The [[hourglass]] uses the flow of sand to measure the flow of time. They were used in navigation. [[Ferdinand Magellan]] used 18 glasses on each ship for his circumnavigation of the globe (1522).<ref>Laurence Bergreen, ''Over the Edge of the World: Magellan's Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe'', HarperCollins Publishers, 2003, hardcover 480 pages, ISBN 0-06-621173-5</ref> Incense sticks and candles were, and are, commonly used to measure time in temples and churches across the globe. Waterclocks, and later, mechanical clocks, were used to mark the events of the abbeys and monasteries of the Middle Ages. [[Richard of Wallingford]] (1292<U+2013>1336), abbot of St. Alban's abbey, famously built a mechanical clock as an astronomical [[orrery]] about 1330.<ref>North, J. (2004) ''God's Clockmaker: Richard of Wallingford and the Invention of Time''. Oxbow Books. ISBN 1-85285-451-0</ref><ref>Watson, E (1979) "The St Albans Clock of Richard of Wallingford". ''Antiquarian Horology'' 372-384.</ref> Great advances in accurate time-keeping were made by [[Galileo Galilei]] and especially [[Christiaan Huygens]] with the invention of pendulum driven clocks. 

The English word [[clock]] probably comes from the Middle Dutch word "klocke" which is in turn derived from the mediaeval Latin word "clocca", which is ultimately derived from Celtic, and is cognate with French, Latin, and German words that mean [[Bell (instrument)|bell]]. The passage of the hours at sea were marked by bells, and denoted the time (see [[ship's bells]]). The hours were marked by bells in the abbeys as well as at sea.

[[Image:ChipScaleClock2 HR.jpg|thumb|A chip-scale [[atomic clock]]]]
Clocks can range from [[watch]]es, to more exotic varieties such as the [[Clock of the Long Now]]. They can be driven by a variety of means, including gravity, springs, and various forms of electrical power, and regulated by a variety of means such as a [[pendulum]].

A [[chronometer]] is a portable timekeeper that meets certain precision standards. Initially, the term was used to refer to the [[marine chronometer]], a timepiece used to determine [[longitude]] by means of [[celestial navigation]].  More recently, the term has also been applied to the [[chronometer watch]], a [[wristwatch]] that meets precision standards set by the Swiss agency [[COSC]].

The most accurate timekeeping devices are [[atomic clock]]s, which are accurate to seconds in many millions of years,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=e24ccfa7-44eb-40b7-8b67-daf8263569ff |title=New atomic clock can keep time for 200 million years: Super-precise instruments vital to deep space navigation |date=2008-02-16 |publisher=Vancouver Sun |accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref> and are used to calibrate other clocks and timekeeping instruments.
Atomic clocks use the spin property of atoms as their basis, and since 1967, the International System of Measurements bases its unit of time, the second, on the properties of [[caesium]] atoms. [[International System of Units|SI]] defines the second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of that radiation which corresponds to the transition between two electron spin energy levels of the ground state of the <sup>133</sup>Cs atom.

Today, the [[Global Positioning System]] in coordination with the [[Network Time Protocol]] can be used to synchronize timekeeping systems across the globe.

The [[SI base unit]] for time is the [[SI]] [[second]]. From the second, larger units such as the [[minute]], [[hour]] and [[day]] are defined, though they are "non-SI" units because they do not use the decimal system, and also because of the occasional need for a [[leap second]]. They are, however, officially accepted for use ''with'' the International System. There are no fixed ratios between seconds and [[month]]s or [[year]]s as months and years have significant variations in length.<ref name="si_units">{{cite book | title = The International System of Units (SI), 7th Edition | url = http://www1.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/si-brochure.pdf | format = PDF | year = 1998 | author = Organisation Intergouvernementale de la Convention du M<U+00E9>tre | accessdate = 2006-06-13}}</ref>

The official SI definition of the second is as follows:<ref name="si_units"/><ref name="second">{{cite web | title = Base unit definitions: Second | url = http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/second.html | publisher = [[NIST]] | accessdate = 2008-01-09}}</ref>

<br clear=left>

At its 1997 meeting, the CIPM affirmed that this definition refers to a caesium atom in its ground state at a temperature of 0 K.<ref name="si_units"/>
Previous to 1967, the second was defined as:

<br clear=left>

The current definition of the second, coupled with the current definition of the [[metre]], is based on the [[special theory of relativity]], which affirms our [[space-time]] to be a [[Minkowski space]].

===World time===
The measurement of time is so critical to the functioning of modern societies that it is coordinated at an international level. The basis for scientific time is a continuous count of seconds based on [[atomic clock]]s around the world, known as the [[International Atomic Time|International Atomic Time (TAI)]].  Other scientific time standards include [[Terrestrial Time]] and [[Barycentric Dynamical Time]].

[[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) is the basis for modern [[civil time]].  Since January 1, 1972, it has been defined to follow TAI with an exact offset of an integer number of seconds, changing only when a [[leap second]] is added to keep clock time synchronized with the rotation of the Earth.  In TAI and UTC systems, the duration of a [[second]] is constant, as it is defined by the unchanging transition period of the cesium atom.

[[Greenwich Mean Time]] (GMT) is an older standard, adopted starting with British railroads in 1847. Using telescopes instead of atomic clocks, GMT was calibrated to the [[mean solar time]] at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]] in the UK. [[Universal Time]] (UT) is the modern term for the international telescope-based system, adopted to replace "Greenwich Mean Time" in 1928 by the [[International Astronomical Union]].  Observations at the Greenwich Observatory itself ceased in 1954, though the location is still used as the basis for the coordinate system.  Because the rotational period of Earth is not perfectly constant, the duration of a second would vary if calibrated to a telescope-based standard like GMT or UT - in which a second was defined as a fraction of a day or year.  The terms "GMT" and "Greenwich Mean Time" are sometimes used informally to refer to UT or UTC.

The [[Global Positioning System]] also broadcasts a very precise time signal worldwide, along with instructions for converting GPS time to UTC.

Earth is split up into a number of [[time zone]]s. Most time zones are exactly one hour apart, and by convention compute their local time as an offset from UTC or GMT. In many locations these offsets vary twice yearly due to [[daylight saving time]] transitions.

===Sidereal time===
[[Sidereal time]] is the measurement of time relative to a distant star (instead of solar time that is relative to the sun). It is used in astronomy to predict when a star will be overhead. Due to the rotation of the earth around the sun a sidereal day is 1/366 (4 minutes) less than a solar day.

===Chronology===
{{main|Chronology}}
Another form of time measurement consists of studying the [[past]]. Events in the past can be ordered in a sequence (creating a [[chronology]]), and can be put into chronological groups ([[periodization]]). One of the most important systems of periodization is [[geologic time]], which is a system of periodizing the events that shaped the [[Earth]] and its life. Chronology, periodization, and interpretation of the past are together known as the study of [[history]].

==Religion==
{{see|:Category:Time and fate deities}}
In the [[Old Testament]] book [[Ecclesiastes]], traditionally ascribed to [[Solomon]] (970<U+2013>928 BC), time (as the Hebrew word <U+05E2><U+05D3><U+05DF>, <U+05D6><U+05DE><U+05DF> ''`iddan(time) z<U+0115>man(season)'' is often translated) was traditionally regarded as a medium for the passage of [[predestination|predestined]] events. (Another word, <U+05D6><U+05DE><U+05DF> ''zman'', was current as meaning ''time fit for an event'', and is used as the modern [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] equivalent to the English word "time".)
[[Image:HinduMeasurements.svg|thumb|left|110px|[[Hindu units of measurement|Hindu units of time]] shown [[logarithmic scale|logarithmically]] ]]

<blockquote>
There is an appointed time (''zman'') for everything. And there is a time (<U+2019><U+00EA>th) for every event under heaven<U+2013><br />
A time (''<U+2019><U+00EA>th'') to give birth, and a time to die; A time to plant, and a time to uproot what is planted.<br />

</blockquote>

===Linear and cyclical time===
{{seealso|Time Cycles|Wheel of time}}
In general, the [[Judaeo-Christian]] concept, based on the [[Bible]], is that time is linear, with a beginning, the act of [[Creation myth|creation]] by [[God]]. The [[Christian]] view assumes also an end, the eschaton, expected to happen when [[Christ]] returns to earth in the [[Second Coming]] to judge the living and the dead. This will be the consummation of the world and time. St Augustine's ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' was the first developed application of this concept to world history. The Christian view is that God is uncreated and eternal so that He and the supernatural world are outside time and exist in [[eternity]]. Christian Science defines time as "error" or illusion.

Ancient cultures such as [[Incan]], [[Mayan]], [[Hopi]], and other Native American Tribes, plus the [[Babylonian]], [[Ancient Greek]], [[Hindu]], [[Buddhist]], [[Jainist]], and others have a concept of a [[wheel of time]], that regards time as [[social cycle theory|cyclical]] and [[quantic]] consisting of repeating ages that happen to every being of the Universe between birth and extinction.
<br clear=both />

===Numeric and Divine time===
The Greek language denotes two distinct principles, [[Chronos]] and [[Kairos]]. The former refers to numeric, or chronological, time. The latter, literally "the right or opportune moment," relates specifically to metaphysical or Divine time. In theology, Kairos is qualitative, as opposed to quantitative.

==Philosophy==
{{main|Philosophy of space and time|Temporal finitism}}

The earliest recorded [[African philosophy]] of time was expounded by the [[ancient Egypt]]ian thinker [[Ptahhotep]] (c. 2650<U+2013>2600 BC), who said: "Do not lessen the time of following desire, for the wasting of time is an abomination to the spirit."{{Fact|date=May 2008}} The ''[[Vedas]]'', the earliest texts on [[Indian philosophy]] and [[Hindu philosophy]] dating back to the late [[2nd millennium BC]], describe ancient [[Hindu cosmology]], in which the [[universe]] goes through repeated cycles of creation, destruction and rebirth, with each cycle lasting 4,320,000 years. [[Ancient philosophy|Ancient]] [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]], including [[Parmenides]] and [[Heraclitus]], wrote essays on the nature of time.<ref>Dagobert Runes, ''Dictionary of Philosophy'', p. 318</ref> 

In Book 11 of [[St. Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine's]] ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'', he ruminates on the nature of time, asking, "What then is time? If no one asks me, I know: if I wish to explain it to one that asketh, I know not."  He settles on time being  defined more by what it is not than what it is,<ref>St. Augustine, ''Confessions'', Book 11.  http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/jod/augustine/Pusey/book11  (Accessed 5/26/07).</ref> an approach similar to that taken in other [[negative theology|negative definitions]].

In contrast to ancient Greek philosophers who believed that the universe had an infinite past with no beginning, [[Medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] and [[Theology|theologians]] developed the concept of the universe having a finite past with a beginning.
This view is not shared by Abrahamic faiths as they believe time started by creation, therefore the only thing being infinite is God and everything else, including time, is finite.

Newton's belief in absolute space, and a precursor to Kantian time, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] believed that time and space are relational.<ref>Gottfried Martin, ''Kant's Metaphysics and Theory of Science''</ref> The differences between Leibniz's and Newton's interpretations came to a head in the famous [[The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence|Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence]].

[[Immanuel Kant]], in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', described time as an ''[[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' intuition that allows us (together with the other ''a priori'' intuition, [[space]]) to comprehend sense experience.<ref name="kant"> {{cite book | last = Kant | first = Immanuel | authorlink = Immanuel Kant | title = The Critique of Pure Reason, 2nd edition | year = 1787}} translated by J. M. D. Meiklejohn, eBooks@Adelaide, 2004<U+2014>http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/k/kant/immanuel/k16p/k16p15.html</ref> With Kant, neither space nor time are conceived as [[Substance theory|substance]]s, but rather both are elements of a systematic mental [[framework]] that necessarily structures the experiences of any rational agent, or observing subject. Kant thought of time as a fundamental part of an [[Abstract structure|abstract]] conceptual framework, together with [[space]] and [[number]], within which we sequence events, [[quantity|quantify]] their duration, and compare the motions of objects. In this view, ''time'' does not refer to any kind of entity that "flows," that objects "move through," or that is a "container" for events. Spatial [[measurement]]s are used to [[quantity|quantify]] the extent of and distances between [[object (philosophy)|object]]s, and temporal measurements are used to quantify the durations of and between [[Phenomenon|event]]s.

In [[Existentialism]], time is considered fundamental to the question of [[being]],{{Fact|date=September 2007}} in particular by the philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]].{{Fact|date=September 2007}} (See [[Ontology]]).

[[Henri Bergson]] believed that time was neither a real homogeneous medium nor a mental construct, but possesses what he referred to as ''Duration''. Duration, in Bergson's view, was creativity and memory as an essential component of reality.<ref>Bergson, Henri (1907) ''Creative Evolution''. trans. by Arthur Mitchell. Mineola: Dover, 1998.</ref>

===Time as "unreal"===
In 5th century BC [[Greece]], [[Antiphon (person)|Antiphon]] the [[Sophist]], in a fragment preserved from his chief work ''On Truth'' held that: ''"Time is not a reality (hypostasis), but a concept (no<U+00EA>ma) or a measure (metron)."''
[[Parmenides]] went further, maintaining that time, motion, and change were illusions, leading to the [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]] of his follower [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Harry Foundalis|title=You are about to disappear|url=http://www.foundalis.com/phi/WhyTimeFlows.htm|accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref>
Time as illusion is also a common theme in [[Buddhist]] thought,<ref>{{cite web|title=Buddhism and the illusion of time|url=http://www.buddhistinformation.com/buddhism_and_the_illusion_of_time.htm|accessdate=2007-04-27|author=Tom Huston}}</ref> and some modern philosophers have carried on with this theme. [[J. M. E. McTaggart]]'s 1908 ''[[The Unreality of Time]]'', for example, argues that time is unreal (see also [[Philosophy of space and time#The flow of time|The flow of time]]).

However, these arguments often center around what it means for something to be "real". Modern physicists generally consider time to be as "real" as space, though others such as [[Julian Barbour]] in his ''[[The End of Time]]'' argue that quantum equations of the universe take their true form when expressed in the timeless [[configuration space]]realm containing every possible "Now" or momentary configuration of the universe, which he terms 'platonia'.<ref>{{cite web|title=Time is an illusion?|url=http://physicsandphysicists.blogspot.com/2007/03/time-is-illusion.html|accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref> (See also: [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)]].)

==Physical definition==
{{main|Time in physics}}
From the age of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] up until [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] profound reinterpretation of the physical concepts associated with time and space, time was considered to be "absolute" and to flow "equably" (to use the words of Newton) for all observers.<ref>Herman M. Schwartz, ''Introduction to Special Relativity'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1968, hardcover 442 pages, see ISBN 0882754785 (1977 edition), pp. 10-13</ref>  The science of classical mechanics is based on this Newtonian idea of time.

Einstein, in his [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]],<ref>A. Einstein, H. A. Lorentz, H. Weyl, H. Minkowski, ''The Principle of Relativity'', Dover Publications, Inc, 2000, softcover 216 pages, ISBN 0486600815, See pp. 37-65 for an English translation of Einstein's original 1905 paper.</ref> postulated the constancy and finiteness of the speed of light for all observers.  He showed that this postulate, together with a reasonable definition for what it means for two events to be simultaneous, requires that distances appear compressed and time intervals appear lengthened for events associated with objects in motion relative to an inertial observer.

[[Einstein]] showed that if time and space is measured using electromagnetic phenomena (like light bouncing between mirrors) then due to the constancy of the speed of light, time and space become mathematically entangled together in a certain way (called [[Minkowski space|Minkowski]] [[space]]) which in turn results in [[Lorentz transformation]] and in entanglement of all other important derivative physical quantities (like energy, momentum, mass, force, etc) in a certain 4-vectorial way (see [[special relativity]] for more details).
{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Fundamental concepts}}

===Classical mechanics===
In [[classical mechanics]] Newton's concept of "relative, apparent, and common time" can be used in the formulation of a prescription for the synchronization of clocks.  Events seen by two different observers in motion relative to each other produce a mathematical concept of time that works pretty well for describing the everyday phenomena of most people's experience.

===Modern physics===
In the late nineteenth century, physicists encountered problems with the classical understanding of time, in connection with the behavior of electricity and magnetism.  Einstein resolved these problems by invoking a method of synchronizing clocks using the constant, finite speed of light as the maximum signal velocity.  This led directly to the result that time appears to elapse at different rates relative to different observers in motion relative to one another.
{{clear}}
[[Image:World line.svg|250px|right|thumb|Two-dimensional space depicted in three-dimensional [[spacetime]]. The past and future [[light cone]]s are absolute, the "present" is a relative concept different for observers in relative motion.]]

===Spacetime===
{{main|Spacetime}}
Modern [[physics]] views the curvature of [[spacetime]] around an object as much a feature of that object as are its [[mass]] and [[volume]].{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

Time has historically been closely related with [[space]], the two together comprising [[spacetime]] in [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]. According to these theories, the concept of time depends on the [[inertial frame of reference|spatial reference frame of the observer]], and the human perception as well as the measurement by instruments such as clocks are different for observers in relative motion.  Even the temporal order of events can change, but the past and future are defined by the backward and forward [[light cone]]s, which never change.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} The [[past]] is the set of events that can send light signals to the observer, the [[future]] the events to which the observer can send light signals. All else is non-observable and within that set of events the very time-order differs for different observers.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

===Time dilation===
[[Image:Relativity of Simultaneity.svg|thumb|[[Relativity of simultaneity]]: Event B is simultaneous with A in the green reference frame, but it occurred
before in the blue frame, and will occur later in the red frame.]]
{{main|Time dilation}}
"Time is nature's way of keeping everything from happening at once".  This quote, attributed variously to [[Einstein]], [[John Archibald Wheeler]], and [[Woody Allen]], says that time is what separates [[Causality (physics)|cause and effect]]. Einstein showed that people travelling at different speeds, whilst agreeing on cause and effect, will measure different time separations between events and can even observe different chronological orderings between non-causally related events. Though these effects are typically minute in the human experience, the effect becomes much more pronounced for objects moving at speeds approaching the speed of light. Many [[subatomic particle]]s exist for only a fixed fraction of a second in a lab relatively at rest, but some that travel close to the speed of light can be measured to travel further and survive much longer than expected (a [[muon]] is one example). According to the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]], in the high-speed particle's [[Inertial reference frame|frame of reference]], it exists, on the average, for a standard amount of time known as its [[mean lifetime]], and the distance it travels in that time is zero, because its velocity is zero. Relative to a frame of reference at rest, time seems to "slow down" for the particle. Relative to the high-speed particle, distances seems to shorten. Even in Newtonian terms time may be considered the fourth dimension of motion; but Einstein showed how both temporal and spatial dimensions can be altered (or "warped") by high-speed motion.

Einstein (''The Meaning of Relativity''): "Two [[Spacetime#Basic concepts|event]]s taking place at the points A and B of a system K are simultaneous if they appear at the same instant when observed from the middle point, M, of the interval AB. Time is then defined as the ensemble of the indications of similar clocks, at rest relatively to K, which register the same simultaneously." 

Einstein wrote in his book, ''Relativity'', that [[Relativity of simultaneity|simultaneity is also relative]], i.e., two events that appear simultaneous to an observer in a particular inertial reference frame need not be judged as simultaneous by a second observer in a different inertial frame of reference.

===Relativistic time versus Newtonian time===

[[Image:Lorentz transform of world line.gif|right|framed|Views of spacetime along the [[world line]] of a rapidly accelerating observer in a relativistic universe. The events ("dots") that pass the two diagonal lines in the bottom half of the image (the past [[light cone]] of the observer in the origin) are the events visible to the observer.]]

The animations visualise the different treatments of time in the Newtonian and the relativistic descriptions. At heart of these differences are the [[Galilean transformation|Galilean]] and [[Lorentz transformation]]s applicable in the Newtonian and relativistic theories, respectively.

In the figures, the vertical direction indicates time. The horizontal direction indicates distance (only one spatial dimension is taken into account), and the thick dashed curve is the [[spacetime]] trajectory ("[[world line]]") of the observer. The small dots indicate specific (past and future) events in spacetime.

The slope of the world line (deviation from being vertical) gives the relative velocity to the observer. Note how in both pictures the view of spacetime changes when the observer accelerates.

In the Newtonian description these changes are such that ''time'' is absolute: the movements of the observer do not influence whether an event occurs in the 'now' (i.e. whether an event passes the horizontal line through the observer).

However, in the relativistic description the ''observability of events'' is absolute: the movements of the observer do not influence whether an event passes the "[[light cone]]" of the observer. Notice that with the change from a Newtonian to a relativistic description, the concept of ''absolute time'' is no longer applicable: events move up-and-down in the figure depending on the acceleration of the observer.

===Arrow of time===
{{main|Arrow of time}}
Time appears to have a direction <U+2013> the past lies behind, fixed and incommutable, while the future lies ahead and is not necessarily fixed. Yet the majority of the laws of physics don't provide this [[arrow of time]]. The exceptions include the [[Second law of thermodynamics]], which states that [[entropy]] must increase over time (see [[Entropy (arrow of time)|Entropy]]); the [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] arrow of time, which points away from the [[Big Bang]], and the radiative arrow of time, caused by [[light]] only traveling forwards in time. In [[particle physics]], there is also the weak arrow of time, from [[CPT symmetry]], and also [[measurement]] in [[quantum mechanics]] (see [[Measurement in quantum mechanics]]).

===Quantised time===
{{seealso|Chronon}}
Time quantization is a hypothetical concept.  In the modern established physical theories (the [[Standard Model]] of Particles and Interactions and [[General Relativity]]) time is not quantized.

[[Planck time]] (~ [[1 E-44 s|5.4 <U+00D7> 10<sup><U+2212>44</sup>]] seconds) is the unit of time in the system of [[natural units]] known as [[Planck units]].  Current established physical theories are believed to fail at this time scale, and many physicists expect that the Planck time might be the smallest unit of time that could ever be measured, even in principle. Tentative physical theories that describe this time scale exist;  see  for instance  [[loop quantum gravity]].

==Time and the Big Bang==
[[Stephen Hawking]] in particular has addressed a connection between time and the [[Big Bang]]. In ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'' and elsewhere, Hawking says that even if time did not begin with the Big Bang and there were another time frame before the Big Bang, no information from events then would be accessible to us, and nothing that happened then would have any effect upon the present time-frame.<ref name=BOT-lecture-B>{{cite web

|quote=Since events before the Big Bang have no observational consequences, one may as well cut them out of the theory, and say that time began at the Big Bang.

Scientists have come to some agreement on descriptions of events that happened 10<sup><U+2212>35</sup> seconds after the Big Bang, but generally agree that descriptions about what happened before one [[Planck time]] (5 <U+00D7> 10<sup><U+2212>44</sup> seconds) after the Big Bang will likely remain pure speculation.

===Speculative physics beyond the Big Bang===
<!-- article is about TIME, not about the Big Bang. This section needs to go to [[Big Bang]] article -->
[[Image:CMB Timeline75.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A graphical representation of the [[metric expansion of the universe|expansion of the universe]] with the inflationary epoch represented as the dramatic expansion of the [[metric tensor|metric]] seen on the left. Image from [[WMAP]] press release, 2006.]]

While the Big Bang model is well established in cosmology, it is likely to be refined in the future. Little is known about the earliest moments of the universe's history. The [[Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems]] require the existence of a singularity at the beginning of cosmic time. However, these theorems assume that [[general relativity]] is correct, but general relativity must break down before the universe reaches the [[Planck temperature]], and a correct treatment of [[quantum gravity]] may avoid the singularity.<ref>{{cite book | author=Hawking, Stephen; and Ellis, G. F. R. | title = The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time | location= Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1973 |isbn = 0-521-09906-4}}</ref>

There may also be parts of the universe well beyond what can be observed in principle. If inflation occurred this is likely, for exponential expansion would push large regions of space beyond our observable horizon.

Some proposals, each of which entails untested hypotheses, are:
* models including the [[Hartle-Hawking state|Hartle-Hawking boundary condition]] in which the whole of space-time is finite; the Big Bang does represent the limit of time, but without the need for a singularity.<ref>{{cite journal | author=[[James Hartle|J.

* [[chaotic inflation]], in which inflation events start here and there in a random quantum-gravity foam, each leading to a ''bubble universe'' expanding from its own big bang.<ref>{{cite journal | author = A.

Linde |title = Eternally existing self-reproducing chaotic inflationary universe | journal = Phys. Lett. |volume = B175 |year =1986|pages=395&ndash;400}}</ref>

Proposals in the last two categories see the Big Bang as an event in a much larger and older universe, or [[multiverse]], and not the literal beginning.

==Time travel==
{{main|Time travel}}
{{seealso|Time travel in fiction|Grandfather paradox}}

Time travel is the concept of moving backwards and/or forwards to different points in time, in a manner analogous to moving through [[space]] and different from the normal "flow" of time to an earthbound observer. Although time travel has been a [[plot device]] in [[fiction]] since the 19th century, and one-way travel into the future is arguably possible given the phenomenon of [[time dilation]] in the [[theory of relativity]], it is currently unknown whether the [[laws of physics]] would allow time travel to the past. Any technological device, whether fictional or hypothetical, that is used to achieve time travel is known as a [[time machine]].
 
A central problem with time travel to the past is the violation of [[causality]]; should an effect precede its cause, it would give rise to the possibility of [[temporal paradox]]. Some interpretations of time travel resolve this by accepting the possibility of travel between [[Multiverse (science)|parallel realities]] or [[universe]]s.

Theory would point toward there having to be a physical [[dimension]] in which one could travel to, where the [[present]] (i.e. the point that which you are leaving) would be present at a point fixed in either the past or future. Seeing as this theory would be dependent upon the theory of a [[multiverse]], it is uncertain how or if it would be possible to just prove the possibility of time travel.

==Perception of time==
===Psychology===
{{see also|Mental chronometry|Sense of time}}
Even in the presence of timepieces, different individuals may judge an identical length of time to be passing at different rates.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} Commonly, this is referred to as time seeming to "fly" (a period of time seeming to pass faster than possible) or time seeming to "drag" (a period of time seeming to pass slower than possible). The psychologist [[Jean Piaget]] called this form of time perception "lived time".{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

This common experience was used to familiarize the general public to the ideas presented by [[Einstein]]'s theory of relativity in a 1930 cartoon by [[Sidney "George" Strube]]:<ref name="Priestley">{{cite book | last = Priestley | first = J. B. | authorlink = J. B.

You haf zee ideah! [''[[sic]]'']<br>'''Man:''' But if I were to sit on a hot stove for two seconds then it would seem like two hours.}}

A form of temporal illusion verifiable by experiment is the [[kappa effect]],<ref name="Wada">Wada Y, Masuda T, Noguchi K, 2005, "Temporal illusion called 'kappa effect' in event perception" Perception 34 ECVP Abstract Supplement</ref> whereby time intervals between visual events are perceived as relatively longer or shorter depending on the relative spatial positions of the events. In other words: the perception of temporal intervals appears to be directly affected, in these cases, by the perception of spatial intervals.

Time also appears to pass more quickly as one gets older.{{Fact|date=July 2008}} [[Stephen Hawking]] suggests that the perception of time is a ratio: ''Unit of Time : Time Lived''.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} For example, one hour to a six-month-old person would be approximately "1:4368", while one hour to a 40-year-old would be "1:349,440". Therefore an hour appears much longer to a young child than to an aged adult, even though the measure of time is the same.

===Altered states of consciousness===
Altered states of consciousness are sometimes characterized by a different estimation of time. Some psychoactive substances <U+2013> such as [[entheogen]]s <U+2013> may also dramatically alter a person's temporal judgement. When viewed under the influence of such substances as [[LSD]], [[psychedelic mushrooms]], and [[peyote]], a clock may appear to be a strange reference point and a useless tool for measuring the passage of events as it does not correlate with the user's experience.  At higher doses, time may appear to slow down, stop, speed up, go backwards and even seem out of sequence. A typical thought might be "I can't believe it's only 8 o'clock, but then again, what does 8 o'clock mean?" As the boundaries for experiencing time are removed, so is its relevance. Many users claim this unbounded timelessness feels like a glimpse into spiritual infinity. To imagine that one exists somewhere "outside" of time is one of the hallmark experiences of a psychedelic voyage.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} [[cannabis (drug)|Marijuana]], a milder psychedelic, may also distort the perception of time to a lesser degree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_effects.shtml |title=Cannabis Effects |accessdate=2008-02-15 |work=Erowid |quote=Time sense altered: cars seem like they are moving too fast, time dilation and compression are common at higher doses.}}</ref>

The practice of [[meditation]], central to all Buddhist traditions, takes as its goal the reflection of the mind back upon itself, thus altering the subjective experience of time; the so called, 'entering the now', or 'the moment'.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

===Culture===
Culture is another variable contributing to the perception of time. Anthropologist [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]] reported after studying the [[Hopi]] cultures that: "<U+2026> the Hopi language is seen to contain no words, grammatical forms, construction or expressions or that refer directly to what we call <U+201C>time<U+201D>, or to past, present, or future<U+2026>"<ref>Carroll, John B. (ed.)(1956). ''Language Thought and Reality. Selected Writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf''. MIT Press, Boston, Massachusetts. ISBN 0262730065 9780262730068</ref> 

In [[Hindi]](one of the official languages of [[India]]), there is only one word ''kal'' for both ''yesterday'' and ''tomorrow'', the meaning determined by the context.

In [[Punjabi]], however, (another one of the official languages of [[India]]), the word 'kal' means 'yesterday', and the similar sounding 'kalu' stands for 'tomorrow.'

==Use of time==
{{see also|Time management|Time discipline}}
In [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]], [[time discipline]] is the general name given to [[society|social]] and [[economics|economic]] rules, conventions, customs, and expectations governing the measurement of time, the social currency and awareness of time measurements, and people's expectations concerning the observance of these customs by others.

The use of time is an important issue in understanding [[human behaviour]], [[education]], and [[travel behaviour]]. [[Time use research]] is a developing field of study. The question concerns how time is allocated across a number of activities (such as time spent at home, at work, shopping, etc.). Time use changes with [[technology]], as the [[television]] or the [[Internet]] created new opportunities to use time in different ways. However, some aspects of time use are relatively stable over long periods of time, such as the amount of time spent traveling to work, which despite major changes in [[transport]], has been observed to be about 20-30 minutes one-way for a large number of cities over a long period of time. This has led to the disputed [[time budget hypothesis]].

[[Time management]] is the organization of tasks or events by first estimating how much time a task will take to be completed, when it must be completed, and then adjusting events that would interfere with its completion so that completion is reached in the appropriate amount of time. Calendars and day planners are common examples of time management tools.

[[Arlie Russell Hochschild]] and [[Norbert Elias]] have written on the use of time from a sociological perspective.
