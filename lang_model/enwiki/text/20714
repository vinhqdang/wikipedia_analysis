<!--Para1: Definition, symptoms and diagnosis-->

'''Schizophrenia''' ({{pron-en|<U+02CC>sk<U+026A>ts<U+0259><U+02C8>fr<U+025B>ni<U+0259>}} or [[WP:IPA for English|/<U+02CC>sk<U+026A>ts<U+0259><U+02C8>fri<U+02D0>ni<U+0259>/]]), from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[Root (linguistics)|roots]] ''schizein'' (<U+03C3><U+03C7><U+03AF><U+03B6><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03BD>, "to split") and ''phr<U+0113>n'', ''phren-'' (<U+03C6><U+03C1><U+03AE><U+03BD>, <U+03C6><U+03C1><U+03B5><U+03BD>-, "[[mind]]") is a [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] diagnosis that describes a [[mental disorder]] characterized by abnormalities in the perception or expression of reality. It most commonly manifests as auditory [[hallucination]]s, [[paranoia|paranoid]] or bizarre [[delusion]]s, or [[thought disorder|disorganized speech and thinking]] with significant social or occupational dysfunction. Onset of symptoms typically occurs in young adulthood,<ref name="castle1991">{{cite journal |author=Castle D, Wesseley S, Der G, Murray RM |year=1991|title=The incidence of operationally defined schizophrenia in Camberwell 1965<U+2013>84 |journal=[[British Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=159 |pages=790<U+2013>794 |pmid=1790446 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/159/6/790 |accessdate=2008-07-05 |doi=10.1192/bjp.159.6.790 }}</ref> with approximately 0.4<U+2013>0.6%<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bhugra D |url=http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0020151 |year=2006 |title=The global prevalence of schizophrenia |journal=[[Public Library of Science|PLoS Medicine]] |volume=2 | issue=5 |pages=372<U+2013>373 |pmid=15916460 |accessdate=2008-02-24 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020151}}</ref><ref name="fn_34">{{cite journal |author=Goldner EM, Hsu L, Waraich P, Somers JM |year=2002 |title=Prevalence and incidence studies of schizophrenic disorders: a systematic review of the literature |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=47 | issue=9 |pages=833<U+2013>43 |pmid=12500753 |url=http://ww1.cpa-apc.org:8080/publications/archives/CJP/2002/November/goldner.asp |accessdate=2008-07-05}}</ref> of the population affected. Diagnosis is based on the patient's self-reported experiences and observed behavior. No laboratory test for schizophrenia currently exists.<ref name="DSM-IV-TR" />

<!--Para2:lack of validity/controversies-->
Studies suggest that [[genetics]], early environment, [[neurobiology]], [[Psychology|psychological]] and social processes are important contributory factors; some recreational and prescription drugs appear to cause or worsen symptoms. Current psychiatric research is focused on the role of neurobiology, but no single organic cause has been found. Due to the many possible combinations of symptoms, there is debate about whether the diagnosis represents a single disorder or a number of discrete syndromes. For this reason, [[Eugen Bleuler]] termed the disease ''the schizophrenias'' (plural) when he coined the name. Despite its [[etymology]], schizophrenia is not the same as [[dissociative identity disorder]], previously known as [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]] or split personality; in [[popular culture]] the two are often confused.

<!--Para3: Dopamine hypothesis and treatment-->
Increased [[dopamine]] activity in the [[mesolimbic pathway]] of the brain is consistently found in schizophrenic individuals. The mainstay of treatment is [[antipsychotic]] medication; this type of drug primarily works by suppressing dopamine activity. Dosages of antipsychotics are generally lower than in the early decades of their use. [[Psychotherapy]], vocational and social rehabilitation are also important. In more serious cases<U+2014>where there is risk to self and others<U+2014>involuntary hospitalization may be necessary, although hospital stays are less frequent and for shorter periods than they were in previous years.<ref name="BeckerKilian2006">{{cite journal |author=Becker T, Kilian R|year=2006 |title=Psychiatric services for people with severe mental illness across western Europe: what can be generalized from current knowledge about differences in provision, costs and outcomes of mental health care? |journal=[[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] Supplement |volume=429 |pages=9<U+2013>16 |pmid=16445476 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2005.00711.x}}</ref>

<!--Para4: Impairment/chronicity and Comorbidity-->
The disorder is thought to mainly affect [[cognition]], but it also usually contributes to chronic problems with behavior and emotion. People with schizophrenia are likely to have additional ([[Comorbidity|comorbid]]) conditions, including [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]] and [[anxiety disorders]];<ref name="Sim_et_al_2006">{{cite journal |author=Sim K, Chua TH, Chan YH, Mahendran R, Chong SA |title=Psychiatric comorbidity in first episode schizophrenia: a 2 year, longitudinal outcome study |journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research |volume=40 |issue=7 |pages=656<U+2013>63 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=16904688 |doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2006.06.008|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022-3956(06)00122-1 |accessdate=2008-07-05}}</ref> the lifetime occurrence of [[substance abuse]] is around 40%. Social problems, such as long-term unemployment, poverty and homelessness, are common. Furthermore, the average [[life expectancy]] of people with the disorder is 10 to 12 years less than those without, due to increased physical health problems and a higher [[suicide]] rate.<ref name="Brown_Barraclough_2000">{{cite journal |author=Brown S, Barraclough B,  Inskip H|year=2000 |title=Causes of the excess mortality of schizophrenia |journal=[[British Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=177 |pages=212<U+2013>7 |pmid=11040880 |doi=10.1192/bjp.177.3.212}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
A person diagnosed with schizophrenia may demonstrate auditory [[hallucination]]s, [[delusion]]s, and [[Thought disorder|disorganized and unusual thinking]] and speech; this may range from loss of train of thought and subject flow, with sentences only loosely connected in meaning, to incoherence, known as [[Schizophasia|word salad]], in severe cases. Social isolation commonly occurs for a variety of reasons. Impairment in [[social cognition]] is associated with schizophrenia, as are symptoms of paranoia from delusions and hallucinations, and the negative symptoms of [[avolition]] (apathy or lack of motivation). In one uncommon subtype, the person may be largely mute, remain motionless in bizarre postures, or exhibit purposeless agitation; these are signs of [[catatonia]]. No one sign is diagnostic of schizophrenia, and all can occur in other medical and psychiatric conditions.<ref name="DSM-IV-TR" /> The current classification of psychoses holds that symptoms need to have been present for at least one month in a period of at least six months of disturbed functioning. A schizophrenia-like psychosis of shorter duration is termed a [[schizophreniform disorder]].<ref name="DSM-IV-TR">{{cite book |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV |author=American Psychiatric Association |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. |location=Washington, DC |year=2000 |chapter=Schizophrenia |chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/schiz.htm |isbn=0-89042-024-6 |accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref>

Late adolescence and early adulthood are peak years for the onset of schizophrenia. These are critical periods in a young adult's social and vocational development, and they can be severely disrupted. To minimize the effect of schizophrenia, much work has recently been done to identify and treat the [[prodrome|prodromal (pre-onset)]] phase of the illness, which has been detected up to 30 months before the onset of symptoms, but may be present longer.<ref name="Addington_et_al_2007">{{cite journal |author=Addington J |coauthors=Cadenhead KS, Cannon TD, Cornblatt B, McGlashan TH, Perkins DO, Seidman LJ, Tsuang M, Walker EF, Woods SW, Heinssen R |year=2007|title=North American prodrome longitudinal study: a collaborative multisite approach to prodromal schizophrenia research |journal=[[Schizophrenia Bulletin]] |volume=33 | issue=3 |pages=665<U+2013>72 |pmid=17255119|doi=10.1093/schbul/sbl075}}</ref> Those who go on to develop schizophrenia may experience the non-specific symptoms of social withdrawal, irritability and [[dysphoria]] in the prodromal period,<ref name="ParnasJorgensen1989">{{cite journal |author=Parnas J |coauthors=Jorgensen A |year=1989 |title=Pre-morbid psychopathology in schizophrenia spectrum |journal=[[British Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=115 |pages=623<U+2013>7 |pmid=2611591}}</ref> and transient or self-limiting psychotic symptoms in the prodromal phase before psychosis becomes apparent.<ref name="Amminger_et_al_2006">{{cite journal |author=Amminger GP |coauthors=Leicester S, Yung AR, Phillips LJ, Berger GE, Francey SM, Yuen HP, McGorry PD |year=2006 |title=Early-onset of symptoms predicts conversion to non-affective psychosis in ultra-high risk individuals |journal=[[Schizophrenia Research]] |volume=84 | issue=1 |pages=67<U+2013>76 |pmid=16677803 |doi=10.1016/j.schres.2006.02.018}}</ref>

===Schneiderian classification===
The psychiatrist [[Kurt Schneider]] (1887<U+2013>1967) listed the forms of psychotic symptoms that he thought distinguished schizophrenia from other psychotic disorders. These are called ''first-rank symptoms'' or [[Kurt Schneider#First-rank symptoms|Schneider's first-rank symptoms]], and they include delusions of being controlled by an external force; the belief that thoughts are being inserted into or withdrawn from one's conscious mind; the belief that one's thoughts are being broadcast to other people; and hearing hallucinatory voices that comment on one's thoughts or actions or that have a conversation with other hallucinated voices.<ref name="SchneiderClinicalPsychopathology">Schneider, K. (1959) ''Clinical Psychopathology''. New York: Grune and Stratton.</ref> Although they have significantly contributed to the current diagnostic criteria, the [[Sensitivity_and_specificity|specificity]] of first-rank symptoms has been questioned. A review of the diagnostic studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that these studies allow neither a reconfirmation nor a rejection of Schneider's claims, and suggested that first-rank symptoms be de-emphasized in future revisions of diagnostic systems.<ref name="pmid17562695">{{cite journal |author=Nordgaard J, Arnfred SM, Handest P, Parnas J |title=The diagnostic status of first-rank symptoms |journal=[[Schizophr Bull]] |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=137<U+2013>54 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=17562695 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbm044 |url=http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17562695}}</ref>

===Positive and negative symptoms===
Schizophrenia is often described in terms of ''positive'' and ''negative'' (or deficit) symptoms.<ref name="Sims_2002">{{cite book |author=Sims A |title=Symptoms in the mind: an introduction to descriptive psychopathology |publisher=W. B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2002 |isbn=0-7020-2627-1 |accessdate=}}</ref> Positive symptoms include [[delusion]]s, [[hallucination|auditory hallucinations]], and [[thought disorder]], and are typically regarded as manifestations of [[psychosis]]. Negative symptoms are so-named because they are considered to be the loss or absence of normal traits or abilities, and include features such as flat or [[blunted affect]] and emotion, poverty of [[Speech communication|speech]] ([[alogia]]), inability to experience pleasure ([[anhedonia]]), and lack of motivation ([[avolition]]). Despite the appearance of blunted affect, recent studies indicate that there is often a normal or even heightened level of emotionality in schizophrenia, especially in response to stressful or negative events.<ref name="schizophrenia1">{{cite journal |author=Cohen & Docherty |year=2004 |title=Affective reactivity of speech and emotional experience in patients with schizophrenia |journal=[[Schizophrenia Research]] |volume=69 | issue=1 |pages=7<U+2013>14 |pmid=15145465 |doi=10.1016/S0920-9964(03)00069-0}}</ref> A third symptom grouping, the ''disorganization syndrome'', is commonly described, and includes chaotic speech, thought, and behavior. There is evidence for a number of other symptom classifications.<ref name="Peralta_Cuesta_2001">{{cite journal |author=Peralta V |coauthors=Cuesta MJ |year=2001 |title=How many and which are the psychopathological dimensions in schizophrenia?

==Diagnosis==
Schizophrenia is diagnosed on the basis of symptom profiles. No [[neuroscience]] correlates yet provide useful enough criteria.<ref>{{cite journal

 | journal = Science's STKE : signal transduction knowledge environment}}</ref> Diagnosis is based on the self-reported experiences of the person, and abnormalities in behavior reported by family members, friends or co-workers, followed by a clinical assessment by a [[psychiatrist]], [[social worker]], [[clinical psychologist]] or other [[mental health professional]]. Psychiatric assessment includes a [[psychiatric history]] and some form of [[mental status examination]]. 

===Standardized criteria===

The most widely used standardized criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia come from the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'', version DSM-IV-TR, and the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]], the ICD-10. The latter criteria are typically used in European countries while the DSM criteria are used in the United States and the rest of the world, as well as prevailing in research studies. The ICD-10 criteria put more emphasis on Schneiderian [[Kurt Schneider#First rank symptoms|first rank symptoms]] although, in practice, agreement between the two systems is high.<ref name="Jakobsen_et_al_2005">{{cite journal |author=Jakobsen KD |coauthors=Frederiksen JN, Hansen T, Jansson LB, Parnas J, Werge T |year=2005 |title=Reliability of clinical ICD-10 schizophrenia diagnoses |journal=Nordic Journal of Psychiatry |volume=59 | issue=3 |pages=209<U+2013>12 |pmid=16195122 | doi = 10.1080/08039480510027698}}</ref> The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] has developed the tool [[SCAN]] (''Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry'') which can be used for diagnosing a number of psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia.{{so?}}

According to the revised fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, three diagnostic criteria must be met.<ref name="DSM-IV-TR" />
# '''Characteristic symptoms''': Two or more of the following, each present for much of the time during a one-month period (or less, if symptoms remitted with treatment).
#* [[Delusion]]s
#* [[Hallucination]]s
#* Disorganized speech, which is a manifestation of [[thought disorder|formal thought disorder]] 
#* Grossly disorganized behavior (e.g. dressing inappropriately, crying frequently) or [[Catatonia|catatonic]] behavior
#* Negative symptoms&mdash;[[affective flattening]] (lack or decline in emotional response), [[alogia]] (lack or decline in speech), or [[avolition]] (lack or decline in motivation)
#:If the delusions are judged to be bizarre, or hallucinations consist of hearing one voice participating in a running commentary of the patient's actions or of hearing two or more voices conversing with each other, only that symptom is required above. The speech disorganization criterion is only met if it is severe enough to substantially impair communication.
# '''Social/occupational dysfunction''': For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, one or more major areas of functioning such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-care, are markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset. 
# '''Duration''': Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least six months. This six-month period must include at least one month of symptoms (or less, if symptoms remitted with treatment).

Schizophrenia cannot be diagnosed if symptoms of [[mood disorder]] or [[pervasive developmental disorder]] are present, or the symptoms are the direct result of a general medical condition or a substance, such as abuse of a drug or medication.

===Confusion with other conditions===
Psychotic symptoms may be present with several other psychiatric illnesses, including [[bipolar disorder]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pope HG |year=1983 |title=Distinguishing bipolar disorder from schizophrenia in clinical practice: guidelines and case reports |journal=Hospital and Community Psychiatry |volume=34 |pages=322<U+2013>328 |url=http://psychservices.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/34/4/322.pdf|format=PDF |accessdate= 2008-02-24}}</ref> [[borderline personality disorder]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=McGlashan TH |title=Testing DSM-III symptom criteria for schizotypal and borderline personality disorders |journal=[[Archives of General Psychiatry]] |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=143<U+2013>8 |year=1987 |month=February |pmid=3813809 |accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref> [[schizoaffective disorder]], drug intoxication, brief drug-induced psychosis, and [[schizophreniform disorder]]. A more general medical and neurological examination may be needed to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms,<ref name="DSM-IV-TR" /> such as [[Metabolic disorder|metabolic disturbance]], [[systemic infection]], [[syphilis]], [[HIV]] infection, [[epilepsy]], and brain lesions. It may be necessary to rule out a [[delirium]], which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating [[level of consciousness]], and indicates an underlying medical illness. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific ''medical'' indication or possible [[adverse effects]] from [[antipsychotic medication]].

"Schizophrenia" does '''''not''''' mean [[dual personality]], despite the [[etymology]] of the word (Greek <U+03C3><U+03C7><U+03AF><U+03B6><U+03C9> = "I split").<!-- A common layman's error -->

===Subtypes===
The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV-TR]] contains five sub-classifications of schizophrenia.
* [[Paranoia#Use in psychiatry|'''Paranoid type''']]: Where delusions and hallucinations are present but thought disorder, disorganized behavior, and affective flattening are absent. (DSM code 295.3/ICD code F20.0)
* [[Disorganized schizophrenia|'''Disorganized type''']]: Named ''hebephrenic schizophrenia'' in the ICD. Where thought disorder and flat affect are present together. (DSM code 295.1/ICD code F20.1)
* [[Catatonia|'''Catatonic type''']]: The subject may be almost immobile or exhibit agitated, purposeless movement. Symptoms can include catatonic stupor and [[waxy flexibility]]. (DSM code 295.2/ICD code F20.2)
* '''Undifferentiated type''': Psychotic symptoms are present but the criteria for paranoid, disorganized, or catatonic types have not been met. (DSM code 295.9/ICD code F20.3)
* '''Residual type''': Where positive symptoms are present at a low intensity only. (DSM code 295.6/ICD code F20.5)

The [[ICD|ICD-10]] defines two additional subtypes.
* '''Post-schizophrenic depression''': A depressive episode arising in the aftermath of a schizophrenic illness where some low-level schizophrenic symptoms may still be present. (ICD code F20.4)
* '''Simple schizophrenia''': Insidious and progressive development of prominent negative symptoms with no history of psychotic episodes. (ICD code F20.6)

===Controversies and research directions===
Part of a larger [[biopsychiatry controversy|controversy over biopsychiatry]], the validity of schizophrenia as a diagnostic entity has been criticised by number of psychologists as lacking in scientific validity and [[diagnostic reliability]].<ref name="Boyle2002">{{cite book |author=Boyle, Mary |title=Schizophrenia: a scientific delusion? |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2002 |isbn=0-415-22718-6}}</ref><ref name="fn_8">{{cite book |author=Bentall, Richard P.; Read, John E; Mosher, Loren R. |title=Models of Madness: Psychological, Social and Biological Approaches to Schizophrenia |publisher=Brunner-Routledge |location=Philadelphia |year=2004|isbn=1-58391-906-6}}</ref> In 2006, a group of patients and mental health professionals from the UK, under the banner of Campaign for Abolition of the Schizophrenia Label, argued for a rejection of the diagnosis of schizophrenia based on its heterogeneity and associated stigma, and called for the adoption of a bio-psychosocial model. Other UK psychiatrists opposed the move arguing that the term schizophrenia is a useful, even if provisional concept.<ref name="schizophrenia_invalid">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6033013.stm Schizophrenia term use 'invalid'.] BBC News Online, (9 October 2006).

The discrete category of schizophrenia used in the DSM has also been criticized.<ref name=Tsuang00/> As with other psychiatric disorders, some psychiatrists have suggested that the diagnosis would be better addressed as individual dimensions along which everyone varies, such that there is a [[spectrum disorder|spectrum]] or continuum rather than a cut-off between normal and ill. This approach appears consistent with research on [[schizotypy]], and with a relatively high prevalence of psychotic experiences, mostly non-distressing delusional beliefs, among the general public.<ref name="fn_5">{{cite journal |author=Verdoux H |coauthors=van Os J |year=2002 |title=Psychotic symptoms in non-clinical populations and the continuum of psychosis |journal=[[Schizophrenia Research]] |volume=54 | issue=1-2 |pages=59<U+2013>65 |pmid=11853979 |doi=10.1016/S0920-9964(01)00352-8}}</ref><ref name="fn_65">{{cite journal |author=Johns LC |coauthors=van Os J |year=2001 |title=The continuity of psychotic experiences in the general population |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=21 | issue=8 |pages=1125<U+2013>41 |pmid=11702510 |doi=10.1016/S0272-7358(01)00103-9}}</ref><ref name="fn_67">{{cite journal |author=Peters ER |coauthors=Day S, McKenna J, Orbach G |year=2005 |title=Measuring delusional ideation: the 21-item Peters et al.

[[Nancy Andreasen]], a leading figure in schizophrenia research, has criticized the current DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria for sacrificing validity for the sake of improving diagnostic reliability. She argues that overemphasis on psychosis in the diagnostic criteria, while improving diagnostic reliability, ignores more fundamental cognitive impairments that are harder to assess due to large variations in presentation.<ref name="pmid10719138">{{cite journal |author=Andreasen NC |title=Schizophrenia: the fundamental questions |journal=[[Brain Res.

The exclusion of affective components from the criteria for schizophrenia, despite their ubiquity in clinical settings, has also become a bone of contention. This exclusion in the DSM has resulted in a "rather convoluted" separate disorder&mdash;[[schizoaffective disorder]].<ref name=competing07/> Citing poor [[interrater reliability]], some psychiatrists have totally contested the concept of schizoaffective disorder as a separate entity.<ref name="pmid17551352">{{cite journal |author=Lake CR, Hurwitz N |title=Schizoaffective disorder merges schizophrenia and bipolar disorders as one disease--there is no schizoaffective disorder |journal=[[Curr Opin Psychiatry]] |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=365<U+2013>79 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17551352 |doi=10.1097/YCO.0b013e3281a305ab |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?an=00001504-200707000-00011}}</ref><ref name="pmid18199238">{{cite journal |author=Malhi GS, Green M, Fagiolini A, Peselow ED, Kumari V |title=Schizoaffective disorder: diagnostic issues and future recommendations |journal=[[Bipolar Disord]] |volume=10 |issue=1 Pt 2 |pages=215<U+2013>30 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18199238 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-5618.2007.00564.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=1398-5647&date=2008&volume=10&issue=1%20Pt%202&spage=215}}</ref> The categorical distinction between mood disorders and schizophrenia, known as the Kraepelinian dichotomy, has also been challenged by data from genetic epidemiology.<ref name="pmid15863738">{{cite journal |author=Craddock N, Owen MJ |title=The beginning of the end for the Kraepelinian dichotomy |journal=[[Br J Psychiatry]] |volume=186 |issue= |pages=364<U+2013>6 |year=2005 |month=May |pmid=15863738 |doi=10.1192/bjp.186.5.364 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15863738}}</ref>

There is little doubt about the existence of a fecundity deficit in schizophrenia. Affected individuals have fewer children than the population as a whole. This reduction is of the order of 70% in males and 30% in females. The central genetic paradox of schizophrenia is why if the disease is associated with a biological disadvantage is this variation not selected out? To balance such a significant disadvantage, a substantial and universal advantage must be exist.

===Prenatal===
Causal factors are thought to initially come together in early [[neurodevelopment]] to increase the risk of later developing schizophrenia.

A number of psychological mechanisms have been implicated in the development and maintenance of schizophrenia. [[Cognitive bias]]es that have been identified in those with a diagnosis or those at risk, especially when under stress or in confusing situations, include excessive attention to potential threats, jumping to conclusions, making external [[Attribution (psychology)|attributions]], impaired reasoning about social situations and [[Theory of mind|mental states]], difficulty distinguishing inner speech from speech from an external source, and difficulties with early visual processing and maintaining concentration.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Broome MR |coauthors=Woolley JB, Tabraham P, Johns LC, Bramon E, Murray GK, Pariante C, McGuire PK, Murray RM |year=2005 |title=What causes the onset of psychosis?

Particular focus has been placed upon the function of dopamine in the [[mesolimbic pathway]] of the brain. This focus largely resulted from the accidental finding that a drug group which blocks dopamine function, known as the [[phenothiazines]], could reduce psychotic symptoms. It is also supported by the fact that  [[amphetamine]]s, which triggers the release of dopamine may exacerbate the psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia.<ref name="Laruelle_et_al_1996">{{cite journal |author=Laruelle M |coauthors=Abi-Dargham A, van Dyck CH, Gil R, D'Souza CD, Erdos J, McCance E, Rosenblatt W, Fingado C, Zoghbi SS, Baldwin RM, Seibyl JP, Krystal JH, Charney DS, Innis RB |year=1996 |title=Single photon emission computerized tomography imaging of amphetamine-induced dopamine release in drug-free schizophrenic subjects |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA |volume=93 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.93.17.9235 |pages=9235<U+2013>40 |pmid=8799184}}</ref> An influential theory, known as the [[Dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia]], proposed that a malfunction involving dopamine pathways was the cause of (the positive symptoms of) schizophrenia.

Interest has also focused on the neurotransmitter [[glutamate]] and the reduced function of the [[NMDA receptor|NMDA glutamate receptor]] in schizophrenia.

Greater connectivity in the brain's [[default network]] and [[task-positive network]] has been observed in schizophrenic patients, and may reflect excessive orientation of attention to [[introspection]] and to [[extrospection]], respectively.

Hospitalization may occur with severe episodes of schizophrenia. This can be voluntary or (if mental health legislation allows it) involuntary (called civil or [[involuntary commitment]]).

The two classes of antipsychotics are generally thought equally effective for the treatment of the positive symptoms. Some researchers have suggested that the atypicals offer additional benefit for the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia, although the clinical significance of these effects has yet to be established.

Service-user led movements have become integral to the recovery process in Europe and the United States; groups such as the [[Hearing Voices Network]] and the [[Paranoia Network]] have developed a self-help approach that aims to provide support and assistance outside the traditional medical model adopted by mainstream psychiatry. By avoiding framing personal experience in terms of criteria for [[mental illness]] or [[mental health]], they aim to destigmatize the experience and encourage individual responsibility and a positive self-image. Partnerships between hospitals and consumer-run groups are becoming more common, with services working toward remediating social withdrawal, building social skills and reducing rehospitalization.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Goering P, Durbin J, Sheldon CT, Ochocka J, Nelson G, Krupa T |title=Who uses consumer-run self-help organizations? |journal=American Journal of Orthopsychiatry |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=367<U+2013>73 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16981815 |doi=10.1037/0002-9432.76.3.367 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/ort/76/3/367 |accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
===Course===
[[Image:John f nash 20061102 3.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Forbes Nash|John Nash]], a US [[mathematician]], began showing signs of paranoid schizophrenia during his college years. Despite having stopped taking his prescribed medication, Nash continued his studies and was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1994. His life was depicted in the 2001 film ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]''.]]
Coordinated by the [[World Health Organization]] and published in 2001, The International Study of Schizophrenia (ISoS) was a long-term follow-up study of 1633 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia around the world. The striking difference in course and outcomes was noted; a half of those available for follow-up had a favourable outcome and 16% had a delayed recovery after an early unremitting course. More usually, the course in the first two years predicted the long-term course. Early social intervention was also related to a better outcome. The findings were held as important in moving patients, carers and clinicians away from the prevalent belief of the chronic nature of the condition.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Harrison G, Hopper K, Craig T, ''et al'' |title=Recovery from psychotic illness: a 15- and 25-year international follow-up study |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=178  |pages=506<U+2013>17 |year=2001 |month=June |pmid=11388966 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11388966 |accessdate=2008-07-04 |doi=10.1192/bjp.178.6.506}}</ref> A review of major [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] in North America noted this variation in outcomes, although outcome was on average worse than for other psychotic and psychiatric disorders.

[[World Health Organization]] studies have noted that individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia have much better long-term outcomes in [[developing countries]] (India, Colombia and Nigeria) than in [[developed countries]] (United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Japan, and Russia),<ref name="fn_44">{{cite journal |author=Hopper K, Wanderling J |title=Revisiting the developed versus developing country distinction in course and outcome in schizophrenia: results from ISoS, the WHO collaborative followup project.

===Defining recovery===
Rates are not always comparable across studies because exact definitions of remission and recovery have not been widely established. A "Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group" has proposed standardized remission criteria involving "improvements in core signs and symptoms to the extent that any remaining symptoms are of such low intensity that they no longer interfere significantly with behavior and are below the threshold typically utilized in justifying an initial diagnosis of schizophrenia".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Andreasen NC, Carpenter WT, Kane JM, Lasser RA, Marder SR, Weinberger DR |title=Remission in schizophrenia: proposed criteria and rationale for consensus |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=162 |issue=3 |pages=441<U+2013>9 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15741458 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.3.441 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15741458 |accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref> Standardized recovery criteria have also been proposed by a number of different researchers, with the stated DSM definitions of a "complete return to premorbid levels of functioning<U+201D> or "complete return to full functioning" seen as inadequate, impossible to measure, incompatible with the variability in how society defines normal psychosocial functioning, and contributing to self-fulfilling pessimism and stigma.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Liberman RP, Kopelowicz A|year=2005 |month=June |title=Recovery From Schizophrenia: A Concept in Search of Research |journal=Psychiatric Services |volume=56 |issue=6 |pages=735<U+2013>742 |url=http://psychservices.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/56/6/735 |accessdate=2008-07-07 |doi=10.1176/appi.ps.56.6.735 |pmid=15939952}}</ref> Some [[mental health professionals]] may have quite different basic perceptions and concepts of recovery than individuals with the diagnosis, including those in the [[consumer/survivor movement]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Davidson L, Schmutte T, Dinzeo T, Andres-Hyman R |title=Remission and recovery in schizophrenia: practitioner and patient perspectives |journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=5<U+2013>8 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=17984297 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbm122 |url=http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17984297 |accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref> One notable limitation of nearly all the research criteria is failure to address the person's own evaluations and feelings about their life. Schizophrenia and recovery often involve a continuing loss of self-esteem, alienation from friends and family, interruption of school and career, and social stigma, "experiences that cannot just be reversed or forgotten".<ref name="Bellack06"/> An increasingly influential [[Recovery model|model]] defines recovery as a process, similar to being "in recovery" from drug and alcohol problems, and emphasizes a personal journey involving factors such as hope, choice, empowerment, social inclusion and achievement.<ref name="Bellack06"/>

===Predictors===

Several factors have been associated with a better overall prognosis: Being female, rapid (vs. insidious) onset of symptoms, older age of first episode, predominantly positive (rather than negative) symptoms, presence of mood symptoms, and good pre-illness functioning.<ref name="Davidson_Glashan_1997">{{cite journal |author=Davidson L, McGlashan TH |title=The varied outcomes of schizophrenia |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=34<U+2013>43 |year=1997 |month=February |pmid=9040921 }}</ref><ref name="Lieberman_et_al_1996">{{cite journal |author=Lieberman JA, Koreen AR, Chakos M, ''et al'' |title=Factors influencing treatment response and outcome of first-episode schizophrenia: implications for understanding the pathophysiology of schizophrenia |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=57 Suppl 9 |issue= |pages=5<U+2013>9 |year=1996 |pmid=8823344}}</ref> The strengths and internal resources of the individual concerned, such as determination or [[psychological resilience]], have also been associated with better prognosis.<ref name="Jobe2005"/> The attitude and level of support from people in the individual's life can have a significant impact; research framed in terms of the negative aspects of this&mdash;the level of critical comments, hostility, and intrusive or controlling attitudes, termed high '[[Expressed emotion]]'&mdash;has consistently indicated links to relapse.<ref name="fn_70">{{cite journal |author=Bebbington P, Kuipers L |title=The predictive utility of expressed emotion in schizophrenia: an aggregate analysis |journal=Psychological Medicine |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=707<U+2013>18 |year=1994 |month=August |pmid=7991753}}</ref> Most research on predictive factors is correlational in nature, however, and a clear cause-and-effect relationship is often difficult to establish.

===Mortality===
In a study of over 168,000 Swedish citizens undergoing psychiatric treatment, schizophrenia was associated with an average life expectancy of approximately 80<U+2013>85% of that of the general population; women were found to have a slightly better life expectancy than men, and a diagnosis of schizophrenia was associated with an overall better life expectancy than [[substance abuse]], [[personality disorder]], [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and [[stroke]].<ref name="fn_45">{{cite journal |author=Hannerz H, Borg<U+00E5> P, Borritz M |title=Life expectancies for individuals with psychiatric diagnoses |journal=Public Health |volume=115 |issue=5 |pages=328<U+2013>37 |year=2001 |month=September |pmid=11593442 |doi=10.1038/sj.ph.1900785 }}</ref> Other identified factors include smoking, poor diet, little exercise and the negative health effects of psychiatric drugs.<ref name="Brown_Barraclough_2000" />

There is a higher than average [[suicide]] rate associated with schizophrenia. This has been cited at 10%, but a more recent analysis of studies and statistics revises the estimate at 4.9%, most often occurring in the period following onset or first hospital admission.<ref>Palmer BA, Pankratz VS, Bostwick JM.

===Violence===
The relationship between violent acts and schizophrenia is a contentious topic. Current research indicates that the percentage of people with schizophrenia who commit violent acts is higher than the percentage of people without any disorder, but lower than is found for disorders such as [[alcoholism]], and the difference is reduced or not found in same-neighbourhood comparisons when related factors are taken into account, notably sociodemographic variables and [[substance misuse]].<ref>Violence and schizophrenia:

The occurrence of [[psychosis]] in schizophrenia has sometimes been linked to a higher risk of violent acts. Findings on the specific role of delusions or hallucinations have been inconsistent, but have focused on delusional jealousy, perception of threat and command hallucinations. It has been proposed that a certain type of individual with schizophrenia may be most likely to offend, characterized by a history of educational difficulties, low [[IQ]], conduct disorder, early-onset substance misuse and offending prior to diagnosis.<ref name= "Mullen 06"/>

==Alternative approaches==
=== Schizophrenia as a social construct ===
An approach broadly known as the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement, most active in the 1960s, opposes the orthodox medical view of schizophrenia as an illness.<ref name="Cooper1969">{{cite book |author=Cooper, David A. |title=The Dialectics of Liberation (Pelican) |publisher=Penguin Books Ltd |location=London, England |year=1969 |isbn=0-14-021029-6}}</ref> Psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]] argued that psychiatric patients are not ill, but rather individuals with unconventional thoughts and behavior that make society uncomfortable.<ref name="Szasz1984">{{cite book |author=Szasz, Thomas Stephen |title=The myth of mental illness: foundations of a theory of personal conduct |publisher=Harper & Row |location=San Francisco |year=1974|isbn=0-06-091151-4}}</ref> He argues that society unjustly seeks to control them by classifying their behavior as an illness and forcibly treating them as a method of [[social control]]. According to this view, "schizophrenia" does not actually exist but is merely a form of [[Social constructionism|social construction]], created by society's concept of what constitutes normality and abnormality. Szasz has never considered himself to be "anti-psychiatry" in the sense of being against psychiatric treatment, but simply believes that treatment should be conducted between consenting adults, rather than imposed upon anyone against his or her will. 

=== Other proposed causes ===
{{Main|Causes of schizophrenia}}
Psychiatrists [[R. D. Laing]], [[Silvano Arieti]], [[Theodore Lidz]] and others have argued that the symptoms of what is called mental illness are comprehensible reactions to impossible demands that society and particularly family life places on some sensitive individuals. Laing, Arieti and Lidz were notable in valuing the ''content'' of [[psychosis|psychotic]] experience as worthy of interpretation, rather than considering it simply as a secondary and essentially meaningless marker of underlying psychological or neurological distress. Laing described eleven case studies of people diagnosed with schizophrenia and argued that the content of their actions and statements was meaningful and logical in the context of their family and life situations.<ref>R.D. Laing's and Aaron Esterson. ''Sanity, Madness and the Family'' (1964)</ref> In 1956, [[Palo Alto]], [[Gregory Bateson]] and his colleagues [[Paul Watzlawick]], [[Donald deAvila Jackson|Donald Jackson]], and [[Jay Haley]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bateson G, Jackson DD, Haley J, Weakland JH|year=1956 |title=Toward a theory of schizophrenia |journal=Behavioral Science |volume=1 |pages=251<U+2013>264}}</ref> articulated a theory of schizophrenia, related to Laing's work, as stemming from [[double bind]] situations where a person receives different or contradictory messages. Madness was therefore an expression of this distress and should be valued as a [[catharsis|cathartic]] and transformative experience. In the books ''Schizophrenia and the Family'' and ''The Origin and Treatment of Schizophrenic Disorders'' Lidz and his colleagues explain their belief that parental behaviour can result in mental illness in children. Arieti's ''[[Interpretation of Schizophrenia]]'' won the 1975 scientific [[National Book Award]] in the United States.

The concept of schizophrenia as a result of civilization has been developed further by psychologist [[Julian Jaynes]] in his 1976 book ''[[The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind]]''; he proposed that until the beginning of historic times, schizophrenia or a similar condition was the normal state of human consciousness.<ref name="Jaynes1976">{{cite book |author =Jaynes J |title=The origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=1976 |isbn=0-395-20729-0}}</ref> This would take the form of a "[[bicameral mind]]" where a normal state of low affect, suitable for routine activities, would be interrupted in moments of crisis by "mysterious voices" giving instructions, which early people characterized as interventions from the gods. Researchers into [[shaman]]ism have speculated that in some cultures schizophrenia or related conditions may predispose an individual to becoming a shaman;<ref name="fn_57">{{cite journal |author=Polimeni J, Reiss JP |title=How shamanism and group selection may reveal the origins of schizophrenia |journal=Med.

Equally, the shaman may have the skill to bring on and direct some of the [[altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]] psychiatrists label as illness. [[Psychohistory|Psychohistorians]], on the other hand, accept the psychiatric diagnoses. However, unlike the current [[Biological psychiatry|medical model of mental disorders]] they may argue that [[Trauma model of mental disorders#Psychohistory Table|poor parenting in tribal societies]] causes the shaman's schizoid personalities.<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Lloyd deMause|DeMause L]]|title=Emotional Life of Nations |publisher=Other Press (NY) |location= |year=2002 |isbn=1-892746-98-0 |chapter=The seven stages of historical personality |chapterurl=http://primal-page.com/ps2.htm |accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref> Commentators such as [[Paul Kurtz]] and others have endorsed the idea that major religious figures experienced psychosis, heard voices and displayed delusions of grandeur.<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Paul Kurtz|Kurtz P]] |title=The transcendental temptation: a critique of religion and the paranormal |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Buffalo, N.Y |year=1991 |isbn=0-87975-645-4}}</ref>

===Alternative medical treatments===

[[Image:Emil Kraepelin.png|left|thumb|[[Emil Kraepelin]] (1856<U+2013>1926) refined the concept of [[psychosis]].]]

A detailed case report in 1797 concerning [[James Tilly Matthews]], and accounts by [[Phillipe Pinel]] published in 1809, are often regarded as the earliest cases of schizophrenia in the medical and psychiatric literature.<ref name="Heinrichs2003"/> Schizophrenia was first described as a distinct syndrome affecting teenagers and young adults by [[B<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>dict Morel]] in 1853, termed ''d<U+00E9>mence pr<U+00E9>coce'' (literally 'early dementia'). The term [[dementia praecox]] was used in 1891 by [[Arnold Pick]] to in a case report of a psychotic disorder. In 1893 [[Emil Kraepelin]] introduced a broad new distinction in the [[classification of mental disorders]] between ''[[dementia praecox]]'' and [[mood disorder]] (termed manic depression and including both unipolar and bipolar depression). Kraepelin believed that ''dementia praecox'' was primarily a disease of the brain,<ref name="fn_2">Kraepelin E. (1907) ''Text book of psychiatry (7th ed)'' (trans. A.R. Diefendorf). London: Macmillan.</ref> and particularly a form of [[dementia]], distinguished from other forms of dementia, such as [[Alzheimer's disease]], which typically occur later in life.<ref name="fn_49">{{cite book |author=Hansen RA, Atchison B |title=Conditions in occupational therapy: effect on occupational performance |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2000 |isbn=0-683-30417-8}}</ref> Kraepelin's classification slowly gained acceptance. There were objections to the use of the term "dementia" despite cases of recovery, and some defence of diagnoses it replaced such as adolescent insanity.<ref>McConaghey, J.C. (1905) [http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/citation/51/213/340 Adolescent Insanity: A Protest against the Use of the Term "Dementia Pr<U+00E6>cox"] Journal of Mental Science (1905) 51: 340-348.</ref>

The word ''schizophrenia''<U+2014>which translates roughly as "splitting of the mind" and comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] roots ''schizein'' (<U+03C3><U+03C7><U+03AF><U+03B6><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03BD>, "to split") and ''phr<U+0113>n'', ''phren-'' (<U+03C6><U+03C1><U+03AE><U+03BD>, <U+03C6><U+03C1><U+03B5><U+03BD>-, "[[mind]]")<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kuhn R; tr.

Bleuler described the main symptoms as 4 ''A'''s: flattened ''Affect'', ''Autism'', impaired ''Association'' of ideas and ''Ambivalence''.<ref name="fn_78">{{cite journal |author=Stotz-Ingenlath G |title=Epistemological aspects of Eugen Bleuler's conception of schizophrenia in 1911 |journal=Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=153<U+2013>9 |year=2000 |pmid=11079343|url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=1386-7423&volume=3&page=153|format=PDF |accessdate=2008-07-03 |doi=10.1023/A:1009919309015}}</ref> Bleuler realized that the illness was not a [[dementia]] as some of his patients improved rather than deteriorated and hence proposed the term schizophrenia instead.

The term ''schizophrenia'' is commonly misunderstood to mean that affected persons have a "split personality". Although some people diagnosed with schizophrenia may hear voices and may experience the voices as distinct personalities, schizophrenia does not involve a person changing among distinct multiple personalities. The confusion arises in part due to the meaning of Bleuler's term ''schizophrenia'' (literally "split" or "shattered mind"). The first known misuse of the term to mean "split personality" was in an article by the poet [[T. S. Eliot]] in 1933.<ref name="fn_3">{{cite book |author=Porter, Roy; Berrios, G.

In the first half of the twentieth century schizophrenia was considered to be a hereditary defect, and sufferers were subject to [[eugenics]] in many countries.

In the early 1970s, the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia was the subject of a number of controversies which eventually led to the operational criteria used today. It became clear after the 1971 US-UK Diagnostic Study that schizophrenia was diagnosed to a far greater extent in America than in Europe.<ref name="Wing1971">{{cite journal |author=Wing JK |title=International comparisons in the study of the functional psychoses |journal=British Medical Bulletin |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=77<U+2013>81 |year=1971 |month=January |pmid=4926366}}</ref> This was partly due to looser diagnostic criteria in the US, which used the [[DSM-II]] manual, contrasting with Europe and its [[ICD-9]]. [[David Rosenhan|David Rosenhan's]] 1972 study, published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' under the title ''[[Rosenhan experiment|On being sane in insane places]]'', concluded that the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the US was often subjective and unreliable.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rosenhan D |year=1973 |title=On being sane in insane places |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=179 |pages=250<U+2013>8 |pmid=4683124| doi=10.1126/science.179.4070.250}}</ref> These were some of the factors in leading to the revision not only of the diagnosis of schizophrenia, but the revision of the whole DSM manual, resulting in the publication of the [[DSM-III]] in 1980.<ref name="Wilson1993">{{cite journal |author=Wilson M |title=DSM-III and the transformation of American psychiatry: a history |journal=[[American Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=150 |issue=3 |pages=399<U+2013>410 |year=1993 |month=March |pmid=8434655 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8434655 |accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref> Since the 1970s more than 40 diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia have been proposed and evaluated.<ref name=competing07>{{cite journal |author=Jansson LB, Parnas J |title=Competing definitions of schizophrenia: what can be learned from polydiagnostic studies? |journal=[[Schizophr Bull]] |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=1178<U+2013>200 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17158508 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbl065 |url=http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17158508}}</ref>

In the [[Soviet Union]] the diagnosis of schizophrenia has also been used for political purposes. The prominent Soviet psychiatrist [[Andrei Snezhnevsky]] created and promoted an additional sub-classification of [[sluggishly progressing schizophrenia]]. This diagnosis was used to discredit and expeditiously imprison political dissidents while dispensing with a potentially embarrassing trial.<ref name="Wilkinson1986">{{cite journal |author=Wilkinson G |year=1986 |title=Political dissent and "sluggish" schizophrenia in the Soviet Union |journal=[[British Medical Journal|Br Med J (Clin Res Ed)]] |volume=293 | issue=6548 |pages=641<U+2013>2 |pmid=3092963}}</ref> The practice was exposed to Westerners by a number of Soviet dissidents, and in 1977 the [[World Psychiatric Association]] condemned the Soviet practice at the Sixth World Congress of Psychiatry.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915433,00.html Censuring The Soviets], TIME, Sep. 12, 1977</ref> Rather than defending his theory that a latent form of schizophrenia caused dissidents to oppose the regime, Snezhnevsky broke all contact with the West in 1980 by resigning his honorary positions abroad.<ref>Sidney Levine, [http://pb.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/5/5/94.pdf The Special Committee on the Political Abuse of Psychiatry], Psychiatr.

==Society and culture==
=== Stigma ===

[[Social stigma]] has been identified as a major obstacle in the recovery of patients with schizophrenia.<ref>McGorry, Patrick (2003). "The Influence of Stigma on Preventive Efforts in Psychotic Disorders," in ''Schizophrenia (WPA Series in Evidence & Experience in Psychiatry)'', p. 292.</ref> In a large, representative sample from a 1999 study, 12.8% of Americans believed that individuals with schizophrenia were "very likely" to do something violent against others, and 48.1% said that they were "somewhat likely" to. Over 74% said that people with schizophrenia were either "not very able" or "not able at all" to make decisions concerning their treatment, and 70.2% said the same of money management decisions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pescosolido BA, Monahan J, Link BG, Stueve A, Kikuzawa S |title=The public's view of the competence, dangerousness, and need for legal coercion of persons with mental health problems |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=89 |issue=9 |pages=1339<U+2013>45 |year=1999 |month=September |pmid=10474550 |pmc=1508769 |doi= |url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10474550 |accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref> The perception of individuals with psychosis as violent has more than doubled in prevalence since the 1950s, according to one meta-analysis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Phelan JC, Link BG, Stueve A, Pescosolido BA|year=2000 |month=June |title=Public Conceptions of Mental Illness in 1950 and 1996: What Is Mental Illness and Is It to be Feared? |journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=188<U+2013>207 |doi=10.2307/2676305}}</ref>

In order to reduce stigma, in 2002 the [[Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology]] changed the term for schizophrenia from ''Seishin-Bunretsu-Byo''<U+3000><U+7CBE><U+795E><U+5206><U+88C2><U+75C5> (mind-split-disease) to ''T<U+014D>g<U+014D>-shitch<U+014D>-sh<U+014D>''<U+3000><U+7D71><U+5408><U+5931><U+8ABF><U+75C7> ([[integration disorder]]). The new name was inspired by the bio-psychosocial model, and it increased the percentage of cases in which patients were informed of the diagnosis from 36.7% to 69.7% over three years.<ref name="Sato">{{cite journal |author=Sato M |year=2004 |title=Renaming schizophrenia: a Japanese perspective |journal=World Psychiatry |volume=5 | issue=1 |pages=53<U+2013>5 |pmid=16757998}}</ref>

Schizophrenia is often confused with [[Multiple Personality Disorder]].{{Fact|date=January 2009}}{{Dubious|date=January 2009}}

=== Iconic cultural depictions ===

The book and film ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]'' chronicled the life of [[John Forbes Nash]], a [[Nobel Prize]]-winning mathematician who was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The [[Marathi language|Marathi]] film ''Devrai'' (featuring [[Atul Kulkarni]]) is a presentation of a patient with schizophrenia. The film, set in the [[Konkan]] region of [[Maharashtra]] in Western [[India]], shows the behavior, mentality, and struggle of the patient as well as his loved-ones. It also portrays the treatment of this mental illness using medication, dedication and plenty of patience by the close relatives of the patient. Other factual books have been written by relatives on family members; Australian journalist [[Anne Deveson]] told the story of her son's battle with schizophrenia in ''Tell me I'm Here'',<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Anne Deveson|Deveson A]] |title=Tell Me I'm Here |publisher=Penguin |year=1991 |pages= |isbn=0-14-027257-7}}</ref> later made into a movie.

In [[Mikhail Bulgakov|Bulgakov's]] ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'' the poet Ivan Bezdomnyj is institutionalized and diagnosed with schizophrenia after witnessing the devil (Woland) predict Berlioz's death. The book ''[[The Eden Express]]'' by [[Mark Vonnegut]] recounts his struggle with schizophrenia and his recovering journey.
