The '''perforating arteries''', usually three in number, are so named because they perforate the tendon of the [[Adductor magnus]] to reach the back of the [[thigh]]. 

They pass backward close to the [[linea aspera]] of the [[femur]] under cover of small tendinous arches in the muscle. 

The first is given off above the [[Adductor brevis]], the second in front of that muscle, and the third immediately below it.

==First==
The ''first perforating artery'' (a. perforans prima) passes posteriorly between the [[Pectineus]] and Adductor brevis (sometimes it perforates the latter); it then pierces the [[Adductor magnus]] close to the linea aspera. 

It gives branches to the Adductores brevis and magnus, [[Biceps femoris]], and [[Gluteus maximus]], and anastomoses with the inferior gluteal, medial and lateral femoral circumflex and second perforating arteries.

==Second==
The ''second perforating artery'' (a. perforans secunda), larger than the first, pierces the tendons of the Adductores brevis and magnus, and divides into ascending and descending branches, which supply the [[posterior femoral muscles]], anastomosing with the first and third perforating. 

The second artery frequently arises in common with the first. 

The [[nutrient artery of the femur]] is usually given off from the second perforating artery; when two nutrient arteries exist, they usually spring from the first and third perforating vessels.

==Third/fourth==
The ''third perforating artery'' (a. perforans tertia) is given off below the Adductor brevis; it pierces the Adductor magnus, and divides into branches which supply the posterior femoral muscles; anastomosing above with the higher perforating arteries, and below with the terminal branches of the profunda and the muscular branches of the [[popliteal]]. 

The nutrient artery of the femur may arise from this branch. 

The termination of the profunda artery, already described, is sometimes termed the ''fourth perforating artery of Elliott'' after the anatomist who first dissected its course.
