'''Health care in Mexico''' is provided via [[public]] institutions, private entities, or private physicians.  Health care delivered through private health care organizations operates entirely on the [[free-market]] system, i.e., it is available to those who can afford it. This is also the case of health care obtained from private physicians at their private office or clinic. Public health care delivery, on the other hand, is accomplished via an elaborate provisioning and delivery system put in place by the Mexican Federal Government. 

==History==
[[Image:Hospicio Caba<U+00F1>as.JPG|thumb|left|250px|[[Hospicio Caba<U+00F1>as]] in [[Guadalajara]] is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]]]

Health care in Mexico dates to at least 1791, when the [[Hospicio Caba<U+00F1>as]] in [[Guadalajara]], Jalisco, Mexico, was founded. The [[institution]], still functioning, is now a [[World Heritage Site]].  It is one of the oldest and largest hospital complexes in [[Latin America]].  The complex was founded by the Bishop of Guadalajara to combine the functions of a [[workhouse]], [[hospital]], [[orphanage]], and [[almshouse]]. 

The [[ubiquitous]] Mexican health care program [[Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social|IMSS]] was founded in 1943.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2009-08-31-mexico-health-care_N.htm USA Today: Mexico's health care lures Americans]</ref>  In the early 1990s, Mexico showed clear signs of having entered a transitional stage in the health of its population. When compared with 1940 or even 1970, Mexico in the 1990s exhibited mortality patterns that more closely approximated those found in developed societies.<ref>

</ref>  By 2009, during the notorious [[swine flu]] pandemic, the [[World Health Organization]] director said that Mexico "gave the world a model of rapid and transparent reporting, aggressive control measures, and generous sharing of data and samples".  The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]'s flu director [[Nancy Cox]], added that Mexico's response "impressed the entire world".<ref>

==Public health care delivery==

Public health care delivery is accomplished via an elaborate provisioning and delivery system instituted by the [[Mexican Federal Government]]. Public health care is provided to all Mexican citizens as guaranteed via Article 4 of the [[Constitution of Mexico|Constitution]].  Public care is either fully or partially subsidized by the federal government, depending on the person's (Spanish: ''derechohabiente's'') employment status.  All Mexican citizens are eligible for subsidized health care regardless of their work status via a system of health care facilities operating under the federal [[Secretariat of Health]] (formerly the ''Secretaria de Salubridad y Asistencia'', or SSA) agency.  

Employed citizens and their dependents, however, are further eligible to use the health care program administered and operated by the [[Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social]] (IMSS) ({{lang-en|Mexican Social Security Institute}}).  The IMSS health care program is a tripartite system funded equally by the employee, its private employer, and the federal government.  

The IMSS does not provide service to employees of the public sector.  Employees in the public sector are serviced by the [[Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado]] (ISSSTE) ({{lang-en|Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers)}}, which attends to the health and social care needs of government employees.  This includes local, state, and federal government employees.

The [[State governments of Mexico|government of the states in Mexico]] also provide health services independently of those services provided by the federal government programs. In most states, the state government has established free or subsidized healthcare to all their citizens. <ref>http://www.sesa-qro.gob.mx/quienes.html</ref>

== Health statistics==
Aggregate health statistics for Mexico have improved greatly since the 1970s.  However, Mexico lags well behind other [[OECD]] countries in health status and health care availability.<ref name=cp>

</ref> 

Total health care spending accounted for 6.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2005; per capita spending on health care was US$675 (adjusted for purchasing power parity)<U+2014>about a quarter of the OECD average.<ref name=cp/>

[[Image:Mexicohospital.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The ''Hospital Angeles'' in Mexico City, part of Grupo Empresarial Los Angeles, the largest private hospital chain in Mexico]]
During 2005, 45.5 percent of health spending was paid from public sources<U+2014>comparable to the share of public spending in the United States but significantly below the OECD average. Private financing in Mexico is almost entirely in the form of [[out-of-pocket]] payments, as only 3.1 percent of total expenditures on health are funded through private health insurance.<ref name=cp/> Consistent with every other major industrialized country (except the U.S.), government healthcare in Mexico is [[universal healthcare|universal]], making private programs' [[health insurance]] unnecessary except for use in private hospitals. 

Some authorities have noted that while Mexico has some 3000 private hospitals, some private <U+201C>hospitals<U+201D> could hardly be considered hospitals at all, since they have no [[medical laboratory|laboratories]], [[radiology|radiography equipment]], or even [[nurse]]s.<ref>
[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1276627 Mexico's Private Hospitals] Retrieved July 10, 2009.</ref> The remaining 1000 or some public hospitals account for the majority of hospital beds and, in fact, the bulk of private hospitals are institutions with less than 20 beds.

In 2005, Mexico had 1.8 doctors and 2.2 nurses per 1,000 population, a significant increase in health care personnel over the previous decade but again below the OECD averages for these indicators. The [[child mortality|mortality rate for children]] younger than five years was 17 per 1,000 live births in 2005, and Mexico has shown a faster acceleration to lower mortality rates than the U.S., Cuba, and Canada in the last 10 years.  Ninety-seven percent of the population had direct access to [[potable water]] and 80 percent to sanitation. Also in 2005 the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome ([[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]) among persons aged 15 to 49 was 0.3 percent.<ref name=cp/> At 11,000 deaths/year vs. 22,000/year in the U.S., this represents a 44% higher per capita death rate than the United States.<ref>

According to the site www.internationalliving.com, health care in Mexico is described as very good to excellent while being highly affordable, with every medium to large city in Mexico having at least one first-rate hospital.  In fact, some California insurers sell [[health insurance]] policies that require members to go to Mexico for health care where costs are 40% lower.<ref>

With many [[physicians]] from the [[U.S.]] having received their training in Mexico, and with many Mexican [[physician|doctor]]s having received at least part of their training in the United States, the quality of Mexican health care has been reported to be comparable to that in the United States: "in general, health care in Mexico is very good<U+2026>and in many places it is excellent."<ref>[http://whatshotinsanmiguel.com/health-services What is Hot in San Miguel]</ref><ref>[http://www.viento.com.mx/index.php?id=7&sub_id=72 Viento Ensenada: Health in Mexico]</ref>  "Many people often arrive at the conclusion that because healthcare in Mexico is so [[cheap]] compared to the US, the quality of [[medical attention]] and knowledge about health care issues in Mexico must be lacking.
