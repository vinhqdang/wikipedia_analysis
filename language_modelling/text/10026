'''''Hygrophorus olivaceoalbus''''', commonly known as the '''olive wax cap''', is a species of [[fungus]] in the genus ''[[Hygrophorus]]''. The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] (mushrooms) appear from midsummer to late autumn under [[conifer]]s in North American and Eurasian mountain forests. The mushrooms have olive-brown, slimy [[pileus (mycology)|cap]]s with dark streaks and a dark [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]]; the caps measure {{convert|3|to|12|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter. Other characteristic features include a slimy [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] up to {{convert|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} long that is spotted with ragged scales up to a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]]-like zone. As its name implies, the mushroom has a waxy cap and [[lamella (mycology)|gills]]. It is native in North America and across the northern regions of Europe. According to a publication by the [[Council of Europe]], the fungus is nearly extinct in France.

Although ''Hygrophorus olivaceoalbus'' mushroom are [[edible mushroom|edible]], opinions are divided regarding its taste. Besides its usage as an edible mushroom, the fungus became more important mainly owing to discoveries of its [[antibiotic]]-like compounds.

== Taxonomy and classification ==
The species was first officially [[species description|described]] as ''Agaricus olivaceoalbus'' by [[Elias Fries]] in 1815.<ref name=Fries1815/> It had earlier been published as ''Agaricus adustus'' by [[August Johann Georg Karl Batsch]] in 1783,<ref name=Batsch1783/> but this was an [[nomen illegitimum|illegitimate]] renaming of ''Agaricus brunneus'' published in 1774 by [[Jacob Christian Sch<U+00E4>ffer]].<ref name=Schaeffer1774/><ref name="urlMycoBank: Agaricus adustus"/> It received its current scientific name when Fries transferred it to the genus ''Hygrophorus'' in 1838.<ref name=Fries1838/> [[Paul Kummer]] moved the species to ''Limacium'' in 1871,<ref name=Kummer1871/> but this genus has since been sunk into [[synonym (biology)|synonymy]] with ''Hygrophorus''.<ref name=Kirk2008/>

Several [[Variety (botany)|varieties]] of ''H.&nbsp;olivaceoalbus'' have been proposed:<ref name="urlMycoBank: Hygrophorus olivaceoalbus"/><ref name=Hesler1963/>

Hesler and Smith, however, refer to smaller fruit bodies and larger spores than in the nominate taxon (10<U+2013>14&nbsp;<U+00D7>&nbsp;5.5<U+2013>7.5&nbsp;<U+03BC>m); additionally, the hyphae of the cap cuticle react dark brown with Melzer's reagent. According to Hesler and Smith, it occurs under firs in [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Michigan]] and [[British Columbia]].<ref name=Hesler1963/>

Together with ''[[Hygrophorus pustulatus|H.&nbsp;pustulatus]]'', ''[[Hygrophorus persoonii|H.&nbsp;persoonii]]'', ''[[Hygrophorus mesotephrus|H.&nbsp;mesotephrus]]'' and ''[[Hygrophorus latitabundus|H.&nbsp;latitabundus]]'', ''H.&nbsp;olivaceoalbus'' form the [[Section (botany)|section]] ''Olivaceoumbrini'' within the genus ''Hygrophorus''.<ref name=Lubken2004/> The fungi of this section have greasy to slimy caps and stems. Their caps are darkish brown grey, olive or orange, and their stems are {{Linktext|natter}}ed or somewhat distinctly ringed.<ref name="l<U+00FC>bken3"/>

[[Common name]]s that have been used for the mushroom include the "slimy-sheathed waxy cap", the "olive hygrophorus",<ref name=Laursen2009/> the "sheated waxgill"<ref name=SchalkwijkBarendsen1991/> and the "olive wax cap".<ref name=Michell2006/> The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] ''olivaceoalbus'' is derived from the [[Latin]] words for olive-brown (''olivaceus'') and white (''albus'').<ref name=Rea1922/>

== Characteristics ==
=== Fruit body ===
[[File:Hygrophorus olivaceoalbus 187544.jpg|thumb|right|Below the ring-like annular zone the stem is nattered; above, it is white and smooth.]]
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''H.&nbsp;olivaceoalbus'' is {{convert|3|<U+2013>|12|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide and is hemispherical in young fungi; they become flatter and wider with age, but they keep their characteristic dark [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]].<ref name=Hesler1963/> Underneath the slimy grey to sooty-brown surface, the [[cap cuticle]] is streaked with fine, dark grey radially arranged fibers.<ref name=SchalkwijkBarendsen1991/> Young fruit bodies are covered by two [[Veil (botany)|velum]] layers; the inner velum, composed of dark fibrils, becomes a [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]] or sheath (annular zone) on the stem that is covered by the gelatinous outer layer.<ref name=Hesler1963/>

The fruit body has a long [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] ranging from {{convert|3|to|12|cm|in|abbr=on}}, a diameter of {{convert|1|<U+2013>|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} and a somewhat slimy surface in wet weather.<ref name=Arora1986/> It is often wavy or bent.<ref name=McKnight1998/> The base of the stem is sometimes slimmer than near its apex. Above the annular zone, the stem is smooth and whitish.  It is covered by two layers of tissue: the exterior sticky layer, and the comparatively thin interior layer that consists of flaky fibres, similar to the those under the cap's slime layer, with which they are initially linked. As the stem grows and increases in length, the interior layer becomes ripped, and breaks up into ragged dark concentric bands. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gill]]s of ''H.&nbsp;olivaceoalbus'' are thick, widely spaced and adnate (broadly attached) to decurrent (extending slightly down the stem); they are white (slightly greyish on the base), and have a waxy surface.<ref name=Arora1986/>

The [[Trama (mycology)|flesh]] of the mushroom is smooth, thin and white. The taste and odor are mild and have no distinct smell.<ref name="kuo"/> When [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification|treated]] with a dilute solution of [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH) or [[sulfuric acid]], the flesh turns reddish. The [[spore print]] of ''H.&nbsp;olivaceoalbus'' is white.<ref name=Hesler1963/>

=== Microscopic characteristics ===
The [[spore]]s are 9<U+2013>12&nbsp;<U+00D7>&nbsp;5<U+2013>6&nbsp;[[<U+00B5>m]], ellipsoid, and are not [[Amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]]; their surface is smooth. They are yellow in [[Melzer's reagent]]. The [[basidium|basidia]] have dimension of 46<U+2013>62&nbsp;<U+00D7>&nbsp;7<U+2013>10&nbsp;<U+00B5>m, and are tetrasporic with short, stubby [[sterigma]]ta. They have neither pleuro[[cystidium|cystidia]] nor cheilocystidia.<ref name=Hesler1963/>

The [[cap cuticle]] has a width of 250 to 450&nbsp;<U+00B5>m and consists of loopshaped, dark [[hypha]]e with a width from 2 to 3&nbsp;<U+00B5>m, which form an ixocutis (a horizontal layer of hyphae embedded in slime) and possess [[clamp connection]]s; the fungus has no hypocutis. The gill [[trama (mycology)|trama]] consists of hyphae about 3 to 8&nbsp;<U+00B5>m thick; the cap tissue comprises radial hyphae.<ref name=Hesler1963/><ref name="kuo" />

The [[mycorrhiza]], formed from ''H.&nbsp;olivaceoalbus'' as a fungal partner, such as the ''Piceirhiza gelatinosa'', is white and has a smooth, waxy surface, with several layers of hyphae layered around the tree's roots; sometimes this mycorrhiza shows [[hypertrophy]]. The hyphae are covered with a jellylike mass that is secreted from the outer walls of the hyphae.<ref name=Haug2002/><ref name=Norris1991/> The ectomycorrhizae can reach lengths of up to {{convert|10|mm|in|abbr=on}} and have few side branches; many older ectomycorrhizae have a cavity at the tip that resembles a hole.<ref name=Agerer2011/>

''H.&nbsp;olivaceoalbus'' shows similarities between other closely related fungi of the genus ''Hygrophorus'', some of which have only minor differences in physical features.<ref name="kuo"/> Examples include ''H.&nbsp;pustulatus'', ''[[Hygrophorus inocybiformis|H.&nbsp;inocybiformis]]'', ''[[Hygrophorus tephroleucus|H.&nbsp;tephroleucus]]'' or ''[[Hygrophorus morrisii|H.&nbsp;morrisii]]''. In the field, ''H.&nbsp;olivaceoalbus'' is distinguished by a combination of features including the double velum, the dark streaks on the slimy cap, the {{Linktext|natter}}ing of the stem, and growth under pines,<ref name=McKnight1998/> as well as by microscopic characteristics. There is no risk of confusing it with toxic fungi.<ref name=Laux1985 />

''Hygrophorus persoonii'' and ''H.&nbsp;olivaceoalbus'' produce different [[mycosterine]] ([[sterole]]) and their flesh react differently with the addition of [[NaOH]]  (red on ''H.&nbsp;olivaceoalbus'' versus olive green on ''H.&nbsp;persoonii''). Furthermore, ''H.&nbsp;persoonii'' favours [[oak]]s as a mycorrhizal partner.<ref name="l<U+00FC>bken1"/> The North American species ''H.&nbsp;inocybiformis'' produces a smaller fruit body with caps measuring {{convert|3|<U+2013>|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, and dry stems that measure {{convert|3|<U+2013>|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.5|<U+2013>|1.2|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name=Bessette1995/>

== Ecology and distribution ==
''Hygrophorus olivaceoalbus'' creates mycorrhizae with conifers. In the [[West Coast of the United States]], associations are most common with [[Sitka spruce]]s and [[Sequoia sempervirens|giant redwoods]].<ref name="kuo"/> In the [[Rocky Mountains]] it associates with [[Engelmann spruce]] and [[blue spruce]],<ref name=Arora1986/> and in northeast North America with [[Tsuga|hemlocks]].<ref name="kuo"/> It usually favours [[acidic soil|acidic]] and chalky ground with [[moss]]es in higher altitudes as well as conifer forests and occasionally [[mixed forest]]s.<ref name=Jahn/> The fruit bodies are often found singly, but may also grow in clusters.<ref name=SchalkwijkBarendsen1991/>

The range of ''H.&nbsp;olivaceoalbus'' stretches across the northern and western North America<ref name="kuo" /> as well as across Europe (except the Mediterranean region) and Russia.<ref name=Jahn/> The fungus typically fruits between late summer and early winter,<ref name=Arora1986/> and occasionally (depending on the geographical location and climate) as early as June or right through December.<ref name=Hesler1963/> The population is currently not [[endangered species|endangered]], except in France, where it is almost extinct.<ref name=Koune2001/>

== Importance ==
=== Edibility ===
''Hygrophorus olivaceoalbus'' finds a use especially in the kitchen, but the indistinct taste of the fruit bodies have received a mixed reception overall. Kate Mitchel considers the waxy surface "unappetizing", while [[David Arora]] described the taste as "bland and slimy".<ref name=Arora1986/> Some authors suggest removing the cap cuticle before eating.<ref name=Testi1999/><ref name=Houdou2005/> Overall, several authors call the mushroom edible, but caution is still required, as "not everyone can eat them".<ref name=SchalkwijkBarendsen1991/> The popularity of this fungus varies from one region to another. It is more commonly consumed in Europe than in North America,<ref name=McKnight1998/> and is differently coveted within Europe. For example, in Spain the fungi is more highly appreciated in [[Catalonia]]; mushroom dishes in this region are more common than in the rest of Spain.<ref name=Roman2004/>
[[File:Cyclopentenonderivate.svg|thumb|right|Cyclopentenonderivate, isolated from ''H.&nbsp;olivaceoalbus'' and their semi-synthetic aetylderivate, with R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup> and R<sup>3</sup> = [[hydrogen|H]] or [[acetyl|Ac]] and n = 14 or 16 <ref name=Lubken2004/>]]

=== Pharmacology ===
Derivates of [[cyclopentenone]]s, the so-called [[hygrophorone]]s, can be obtained from the fruit body of ''H.&nbsp;olivaceoalbus''; the fungus produces them as [[secondary metabolite]]s. 
The detected compounds are [[polyol]]s and have an [[fungicide|antifungal]] and [[bactericide|antibacterial]] effect, especially in connection with [[Gram staining|Gram-positive]] [[bacteria]]. ''H.&nbsp;olivaceoalbus'' is therefore an important source of [[antibiotic]]s, especially as the hygrophorones also show an effect on bacterial cultures that are [[antibiotic-resistant bacteria|resistant]] against contemporary antibiotics such as [[methicillin]], [[ciprofloxacin]] or [[vancomycin]].<ref name="l<U+00FC>bken2"/> The fungus has been used in [[Traditional Chinese medicine]], where it is known for its curing components, such as 4-, 6- or 4,5,6-tri-''O''-acetyl hygrophorones B<sup>14</sup>.<ref name=Zhou2011a/><ref name=Zhou2011b/>
