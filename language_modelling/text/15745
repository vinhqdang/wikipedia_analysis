'''Albert Henry Stanley, 1st Baron Ashfield''', [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]], [[Territorial Decoration|TD]] (8 August 1874&nbsp;<U+2013> 4 November 1948), born '''Albert Henry Knattriess''', was managing director, then chairman of the [[Underground Electric Railways Company of London]] (UERL) from 1910 to 1933 and chairman of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (LPTB) from 1933 to 1947.

Although born in Britain, his early career was in the United States, where at a young age, he held senior positions in the developing tramway systems of Detroit and New Jersey. In 1898, he served in the [[United States Navy]] during the short [[Spanish<U+2013>American War]].

In 1907, his management skills led to his recruitment by the UERL, which was struggling through a financial crisis that threatened its existence. He quickly integrated the company's management and used advertising and public relations to improve profits. As managing director of the UERL from 1910, he led the take-over of competing underground railway companies and bus and tram operations to form an integrated transport operation known as the Combine.

He was [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Ashton-under-Lyne (UK Parliament constituency)|Ashton-under-Lyne]] from December 1916 to January 1920 and was [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry|President of the Board of Trade]] between December 1916 and May 1919, reorganising the board and establishing specialist departments for various industries. He returned to the UERL and then chaired it and its successor the LPTB during the organisation's greatest period of expansion between the two World Wars, making it a world-respected organisation considered an exemplar of the best form of public administration.

==Early life and career in United States==
Stanley was born on 8 August 1874, in [[Normanton, Derbyshire|New Normanton]], [[Derbyshire]], England, the son of Henry and Elizabeth Knattriess (n<U+00E9>e Twigg). His father worked as a [[coachbuilder]] for the [[Pullman Company]]. In 1880, the family emigrated to [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] in the United States, where he worked at Pullman's main factory. During the 1890s, the family changed its name to "Stanley".{{sfn|Barker|2004}}

In 1888, at the age of 14, Stanley left school and went to work as an office boy at the [[Detroit United Railway|Detroit Street Railways Company]], which ran a horse-drawn tram system. He continued to study at evening school and worked long hours, often from 7.30&nbsp;am to 10.00&nbsp;pm.{{sfn|Bridges|Tiltman|1928|p=14}} His abilities were recognised early and Stanley was given responsibility for scheduling the services and preparing the timetables when he was 17. Following the expansion and [[electrification]] of the tramway, he became General Superintendent of the company in 1894.{{sfn|Bridges|Tiltman|1928|p=17}}{{sfn|Wolmar|2005|p=199}}

Stanley was a naval [[reservist]] and, during the brief [[Spanish<U+2013>American War]] of 1898, he served in the United States Navy as a [[Landman (rank)|Landsman]] in the crew of ''[[USS Yosemite (1892)|USS Yosemite]]'' alongside many others from Detroit.{{sfn|Barker|2004}}{{sfn|Stringham|1929|pp=41<U+2013>42}} In 1903, Stanley moved to New Jersey to become assistant general manager of the street railway department of the [[Public Service Railway|Public Service Corporation of New Jersey]]. The company had been struggling, but Stanley quickly improved its organisation and was promoted to general manager of the department in January 1904. In January 1907, he became general manager of the whole corporation, running a network of almost 1,000 route miles and 25,000 employees.{{sfn|Barker|2004}}{{sfn|Bridges|Tiltman|1928|p=17}}

In 1904, Stanley married Grace Lowrey (1878&ndash;1962) of New York.{{sfn|Barker|2004}}<ref name="1911_census">{{cite web |url=http://fmpbsol.1911census.co.uk/ |title=1911 census |publisher=Find My Past |accessdate=9 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|date=25 January 1962|title=Today's Arrangements |journal=[[The Times]]|issue=55298|page=p. 11|url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/6/255/99075915w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS184771129&dyn=205!xrn_2_0_CS184771129 |accessdate=9 December 2010}} (subscription required)</ref> The couple had two daughters: Marian Stanley (born 1906) and Grace Stanley (born 1907).{{sfn|Barker|2004}}<ref name="1911_census"/><ref>{{cite journal|date=26 July 1923|title=Court Circular |journal=[[The Times]]|issue=43403|page=p. 15|url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/876/393/119504230w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS251860218|accessdate=24 August 2010}} (subscription required)</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=NpzjL03BABzf0UH6JO6MTw&scan=1|title=Index entry|accessmonthday=December 9|accessyear=2010|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}</ref>

==Career in Britain==
===Rescue of the Underground Electric Railways Company===
On 20 February 1907, Sir George Gibb, managing director of the [[Underground Electric Railways Company of London]] (UERL), appointed Stanley as its general manager.{{sfn|Wolmar|2005|p=196}} The UERL was the [[holding company]] of four underground railways in central London.{{sfn|Wolmar|2005|p=169}} Three of these (the [[Metropolitan District Railway]], the [[Baker Street and Waterloo Railway]] and the [[Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway]]) were already in operation and the fourth (the [[Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway]]) was about to open.{{sfn|Rose|1999}} The UERL had been established by American financier [[Charles Yerkes]] and much of the finance and equipment had been brought from the United States, so Stanley's experience of managing urban transit systems in that country made him an ideal candidate for the position. The cost of constructing three new lines in just a few years had put the company in a precarious monetary position and income was not sufficient to pay the interest on its loans.{{sfn|Wolmar|2005|p=197}}  Stanley's responsibility was to restore the finances.

Faint background detail shows the River Thames, roads and non-underground lines.]]
Only recently promoted to general manager of the New Jersey system, Stanley had been reluctant to take the position in London and took it for one year only, provided he would be free to return to America at the end of the year. He told the company's senior managers that the company was almost bankrupt and got resignation letters from each of them post-dated by six months.{{sfn|Wolmar|2005|p=200}}{{sfn|Bridges|Tiltman|1928|p=18}} Through better integration of the separate companies within the group and by improving advertising and [[public relations]], he was quickly able to turn the fortunes of the company around,{{sfn|Barker|2004}} while the company's chairman, [[Edgar Speyer|Sir Edgar Speyer]], renegotiated the debt repayments.{{sfn|Wolmar|2005|p=197}} In 1908, Stanley joined the company's board and, in 1910, he became the managing director.{{sfn|Barker|2004}}

With Commercial Manager [[Frank Pick]], Stanley instigated a plan to increase passenger numbers: developing the "UndergrounD" brand and establishing a joint booking system and co-ordinated fares throughout all of London's underground railways, including those not controlled by the UERL.{{sfn|Wolmar|2005|p=199}} In July 1910, Stanley took the integration of the group further, when he persuaded previously reluctant American investors to approve the merger of the three tube railways into a single company.{{sfn|Wolmar|2005|p=198}}{{sfn|Day|Reed|2008|p=79}} Further consolidation came with the UERL's take-over of [[London General Omnibus Company]] (LGOC) in  1912 and the [[Central London Railway]] and the [[City and South London Railway]] on 1 January 1913. Of London's underground railways, only the [[Metropolitan Railway]] (and its subsidiaries the [[Great Northern & City Railway]] and the [[East London Railway]]) and the [[Waterloo & City Railway]] remained outside of the Underground Group's control. The LGOC was the dominant bus operator in the capital and its high profitability (it paid dividends of 18 per cent compared with Underground Group companies' dividends of 1 to 3 per cent) subsidised the rest of the group.{{sfn|Wolmar|2005|p=204}} Stanley further expanded the group through shareholdings in [[London United Tramways]] and [[Metropolitan Electric Tramways]] and the take-over of bus builder [[Associated Equipment Company|AEC]].<ref name="obit"/> The much enlarged group became known as the Combine.{{sfn|Wolmar|2005|p=193}} On 29 July 1914, Stanley was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in recognition of his services to transport.<ref name=Gazette1>{{London Gazette

|startpage=5963
|accessdate=9 April 2010}}</ref>

Stanley also planned extensions of the existing Underground Group's lines into new, undeveloped districts beyond the central area to encourage the development of new suburbs and new commuter traffic. The first of the extensions, the [[Bakerloo line]] to [[Queen's Park station|Queen's Park]] and [[Watford Junction railway station|Watford Junction]], opened between 1915 and 1917.{{sfn|Rose|1999}} The other expansion plans were postponed during World War I.{{sfn|Wolmar|2005|p=207}}

===Government===
In 1915, Stanley was given a wartime role as Director-General of Mechanical Transport at the [[Minister of Munitions|Ministry of Munitions]].{{sfn|Wolmar|2005|p=325}} In 1916, he was selected by Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] to become [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry|President of the Board of Trade]]. Lloyd George had previously promised this role to [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Sir Max Aitken]] (later Lord Beaverbrook), [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Ashton-under-Lyne (UK Parliament constituency)|Ashton-under-Lyne]]. At that time, a member of parliament taking a cabinet post for the first time had to resign and stand for re-election in a [[by-election]].  Aitken had made arrangements to do this before Lloyd George decided to appoint Stanley to the position instead. Aitken, a friend of Stanley, was persuaded to continue with the resignation in exchange for a peerage so that Stanley could take his seat.{{sfn|Blake|1955|pp=346<U+2013>347}} Stanley became President of the Board of Trade and was made a [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Counsellor]] on 13 December 1916.<ref name=Gazette2>{{London Gazette

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|1918 general election]], Stanley was opposed by T. F. Lister, the President of the [[National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers]], in a challenge over the government's policy on war pensions. With the backing of Beaverbrook, who visited his former constituency to speak on his behalf, Stanley won the election.{{sfn|Wootton|1963|pp=204<U+2013>205}}

Stanley's achievements in office were mixed. He established various specialist departments to manage output in numerous industries and reorganised the structure of the Board.<ref name="obit">{{cite journal|date=5 November 1948|title=Obituary <U+2013> Lord Ashfield, Reorganizer of London Transport|journal=[[The Times]]|issue=51221|pages=p. 7|url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/128/652/107127681w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS119752549&dyn=3!xrn_2_0_CS119752549&hst_1?|accessdate=9 April 2010|ref=harv}}  (subscription required)</ref> However, despite previous successes with unions, his negotiations were ineffective. Writing to [[Leader of the House of Commons]] and future Prime Minister [[Bonar Law|Andrew Bonar Law]] in January 1919, Lloyd George described Stanley as having "all the glibness of [[Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Runciman]] and that is apt to take in innocent persons like you and me&nbsp;... Stanley, to put it quite bluntly, is a funk, and there is no room for funks in the modern world."<ref>Lloyd George letter to Bonar Law, 29 January 1919 <U+2013> quoted in {{harvnb|Morgan|1979|p=51}}.</ref> Stanley left the [[Board of Trade]] and the government in May 1919 and returned to the UERL.

===Return to the Underground===
Back at the Underground Group, Stanley returned to his role as managing director and also became its chairman, replacing [[Lord George Hamilton]].<ref name="LGH">{{cite journal|date=31 May 1919|title=Sir A.

The Central London Railway was extended to [[Ealing Broadway station|Ealing Broadway]] in 1920, and the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway was extended to [[Hendon Central tube station|Hendon]] in 1923 and to [[Edgware tube station|Edgware]] in 1924. The City and South London Railway was reconstructed with larger diameter tunnels to take modern trains between 1922 and 1924 and extended to [[Morden tube station|Morden]] in 1926.{{sfn|Rose|1999}} In addition, a programme of modernising many of the Underground's busiest central London stations was started; providing them with escalators to replace [[elevator|lifts]].{{sfn|Day|Reed|2008|p=93}} New rolling stock was gradually introduced with automatic sliding doors along the length of the carriage instead of manual end gates.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2008|pp=104<U+2013>107}}  By the middle of the 1920s, the organisation had expanded to such an extent that a large, new headquarters building was constructed at [[55 Broadway]] over [[St. James's Park tube station|St. James's Park station]].{{sfn|Wolmar|2005|p=269}}

Starting in the early 1920s, competition from numerous small bus companies, nicknamed "pirates" because they operated irregular routes and plundered the LGOC's passengers, eroded the profitability of the Combine's bus operations and had a negative impact on the profitability of the whole group.{{sfn|Wolmar|2005|p=259}} Ashfield [[lobbying|lobbied]] the government for regulation of transport services in the London area. Starting in 1923, a series of legislative initiatives were made in this direction, with Ashfield and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[London County Council]]lor (later [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|MP]] and [[Secretary_of_State_for_Transport#Minister_of_Transport|Minister of Transport]]) [[Herbert Morrison]], at the forefront of debates as to the level of regulation and public control under which transport services should be brought. Ashfield aimed for regulation that would give the UERL group protection from competition and allow it to take substantive control of the [[London County Council|LCC's]] tram system; Morrison preferred full public ownership.{{sfn|Wolmar|2005|pp=259<U+2013>262}} After seven years of false starts, a bill was announced at the end of 1930 for the formation of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (LPTB), a public corporation that would take control of the UERL, the Metropolitan Railway and all bus and tram operators within an area designated as the [[London Passenger Transport Board#London Passenger Transport Area|London Passenger Transport Area]].<ref>

The opening of extensions of the [[Piccadilly line]] to [[Uxbridge tube station|Uxbridge]], [[Hounslow West tube station|Hounslow]] and [[Cockfosters tube station|Cockfosters]] followed in 1933.{{sfn|Rose|1999}} On the Metropolitan Railway, Ashfield and Pick instigated a rationalisation of services. The barely used and loss-making [[Brill Tramway|Brill]] and [[Verney Junction railway station|Verney Junction]] branches beyond [[Aylesbury railway station|Aylesbury]] were closed in 1935 and 1936.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2008|p=120}} Freight services were reduced and electrification of the remaining steam operated sections of the line was planned.{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=56}} In 1935, the availability of [[government-backed loan]]s to stimulate the flagging economy allowed Ashfield and Pick to promote system-wide improvements under the [[New Works Programme|New Works Programme for 1935<U+2013>1940]], including the transfer of the [[Metropolitan line]]'s [[Stanmore tube station|Stanmore]] services to the [[Bakerloo line]] in 1939, the [[Northern line]]'s [[Northern line#Northern Heights|Northern Heights]] project and extension of the [[Central line]] to [[Ongar tube station|Ongar]] and [[Denham railway station|Denham]].{{sfn|Day|Reed|2008|p=118}}<ref group=note>Much of the works were interrupted by [[World War II]].

Following a reorganisation of public transportation by the Labour government of [[Clement Attlee]], the LPTB was scheduled to be nationalised along with the majority of British railway, bus, road haulage and waterway concerns from 1 January 1948. In advance of this, Ashfield resigned from the LPTB at the end of October 1947 and joined the board of the new [[British Transport Commission]] which was to operate all of the nationalised public transport systems. At nationalisation, the LPTB was to be abolished and replaced by the [[London Transport Executive]].

Ashfield died on 4 November 1948 at 31 [[Queen's Gate]], [[Kensington]].{{sfn|Barker|2004}} During his near forty-year tenure as managing director and chairman of the Underground Group and the LPTB, Ashfield oversaw the transformation of a collection of unconnected, competing railway, bus and tram companies, some in severe financial difficulties, into a coherent and well managed transport organisation, internationally respected for its technical expertise and design style. Transport historian [[Christian Wolmar]] considers it "almost impossible to exaggerate the high regard in which LT was held during its all too brief heyday, attracting official visitors from around the world eager to learn the lessons of its success and apply them in their own countries." "It represented the apogee of a type of confident public administration&nbsp;... with a reputation that any state organisation today would envy&nbsp;... only made possible by the brilliance of its two famous leaders, Ashfield and Pick."{{sfn|Wolmar|2005|p=255}}
