"'''Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]] from her third studio album, ''[[I Am... Sasha Fierce]]'' (2008). It was released by [[Columbia Records]] on October&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2008, as the album's [[lead single]] alongside "[[If I Were a Boy]]", showcasing the contrast between Knowles' persona as herself and her aggressive onstage [[alter ego]] Sasha Fierce. Inspired by her secret marriage to [[Jay-Z]] in April&nbsp;2008, the song explores men's unwillingness to commit, a topic that motivated Knowles to write "Single Ladies", "the only public statement [Knowles and Jay-Z] ever made about marriage".<ref name="people"/>

Composed by [[Christopher Stewart (music producer)|Christopher "Tricky" Stewart]], [[The-Dream|Terius "The-Dream" Nash]], [[Kuk Harrell|Thaddis "Kuk" Harrell]] and Knowles, "Single Ladies" is a [[dance-pop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] song with [[dancehall]], [[disco]], and [[bounce music|bounce]] influences. According to the lyrics, the female protagonist is in a club to celebrate after a recent end to a poor relationship; her former lover is also present. The song and the repeated refrain, "If you like it then you should have put a ring on it", are directed to him. Critics praised the song for its smooth production and noted its similarity to Knowles' 2007 single "[[Get Me Bodied]]". "Single Ladies" won the [[Grammy Award]]s for the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song|Best R&B Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance|Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]]. It received many other awards and nominations between 2008 and 2010, and was named one of the best songs of 2008 by media outlets including [[MTV News]], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine. It was also included on many critics' list of the best songs of the 2000s.

"Single Ladies" peaked at number&nbsp;one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and has been [[RIAA certification|certified quadruple-platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), having sold more than 4.7&nbsp;million digital copies.<ref name="top20Grein"/> The song reached the top ten on the singles charts of Australia, Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom, and achieved multi-platinum [[List of music recording certifications|certifications]] in many of these countries. As of November&nbsp;2009, "Single Ladies" had sold more than 6.1&nbsp;million digital copies worldwide.<ref name="totalsales2010">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/library/DMR2010.pdf|title=Digital Music Sales Around The World|date=January 21, 2010|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|page=10|accessdate=December 15, 2010}}</ref>

Directed by [[Jake Nava]], the single's accompanying music video was shot in black-and-white. It features the [[J-Setting]] dance choreography that was inspired by "Mexican Breakfast", a 1969 routine choreographed by [[Bob Fosse]]. The music video has been parodied and imitated around the world, spawning the "first major dance craze" of the Internet age.<ref name="Star"/> The dance routine was first parodied on the November 15, 2008, episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL''). The clip has won several awards, including [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]]. Knowles performed the song live on televised shows, at awards ceremonies, and during her worldwide [[I Am... Tour]].

Knowles told Simon Vozick-Levinson of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' that the inspiration for the video was a 1969 [[Bob Fosse]] routine entitled "Mexican Breakfast" seen on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', which featured Fosse's wife, [[Gwen Verdon]], dancing with two other women.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/03/10/beyonce-tour/|title=Beyonc<U+00E9> talks world tour, new videos|last=Vozick-Levinson|first=Simon|date=March 10, 2009|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=December 15, 2010}}</ref><ref name="ed">{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/the-ed-sullivan-show/june-1-1969-smokey-robinson-and-the-miracles-lesley-gore-gwen-verdon-107144/|title=TV.com: The Ed Sullivan Show, June&nbsp;1, 1969|publisher=[[TV.com]].

Knowles wanted a simple music video; it was therefore filmed without alternative camera shots and cuts, or changes to hairstyles, costumes, sets and lighting.<ref name=lioa/> According to JaQuel Knight, Knowles also wanted the video to feel "good and powerful"<ref name="people"/> and include choreography that could be attempted by anybody.<ref name="people"/> The day the video was shot, the song was divided into three parts.<ref name=lad/> Nava deliberately used lengthy shots so that viewers "would connect with the human endeavor of Beyonc<U+00E9>'s awe-inspiring dance",<ref name=lad/> with all the changes in looks, [[camera angle|angles]], and lighting executed live on-camera because he wanted to keep the feel "very organic and un-gimmicky".<ref name=lad/><ref name="changes"/> The styling was inspired by a ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' photo shoot.<ref name=lad>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1621294/20090911/knowles_beyonce.jhtml|title=Beyonc<U+00E9>'s VMA-Nominated 'Single Ladies' Video Began As An Afterthought|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=September 12, 2009|publisher=MTV News.

===Synopsis===
In the video for "Single Ladies", emphasis is laid on Knowles' more aggressive and sensual side, her alter ego Sasha Fierce. It shows her in an asymmetrical [[leotard]] and high-heels, with two look-alike backup dancers, Ebony Williams and Ashley Everett.<ref name="mtv1"/> Knowles' mother, [[Tina Knowles]], said that she designed the high-cut leotards after seeing something similar in the American [[musical film]]s ''[[A Chorus Line (film)|A Chorus Line]]'' and ''[[All That Jazz]]''.<ref name="people"/> The dance routine incorporates many styles, including [[jazz dance|jazz]], [[tap dance|tap]], and [[hip hop dance|hip hop]], and is credited with popularizing J-Setting, a flamboyant [[lead and follow]] dance style prominent in many African American gay clubs across Atlanta and used by the all-female J-Sette dance troupe of [[Jackson State University]].<ref name="chi"/><ref name="changes"/>

The video features Knowles and her two companions dancing inside an [[infinity cove]], which alternates between black and white and places the focus on the complex choreography. Throughout the video the women click their heels and shake their hips and legs. However, the main intention is to attract the viewers' attention toward their hands and ring fingers as they do the hand-twirl move.<ref name="mtv1"/> At one point during the video, the dancers run up to a wall, which, according to Frank Gatson Jr., pays homage to [[Shirley MacLaine]]'s act in the 1969 film ''[[Sweet Charity (film)|Sweet Charity]]''.<ref name="people"/> Toward the end of the video, Knowles flashes her own wedding ring on her finger.<ref name="people"/><ref name="mtv1"/>

Although the video for "Single Ladies" was the cheapest and quickest of all her videos to produce, Knowles felt that it ended up being "the most iconic&nbsp;... something special".<ref name=lioa/> It spawned a [[Novelty and fad dances|dance craze]] and inspired thousands of imitations all over the world, many of which were posted on [[YouTube]].<ref name="people"/> In an interview with MTV, Knowles expressed her appreciation of the public's response to the video, and stated that she had spent much time watching several of these parodies: "It's beautiful to feel you touch people and bring a song to life with a video."<ref name="lady"/> Nava also expressed his surprise at the positive reception of the video, and attributed its success to the video's understated, less-is-more approach.<ref name=lad/> In an interview with Chandler Levack for ''Eye Weekly'', Toronto director Scott Cudmore stated that the internet age has impacted the way music videos are made, as well as perceived by an audience. Although Cudmore believes that the music video as a medium is "disappearing ... from the mainstream public eye", he accredited "Single Ladies" with its resurgence, and stated that after the video appeared on the Internet, people began to "consciously look for music videos because of its art".<ref name="cudmore">{{cite news|first=Chandler|last=Levack |title=Living on in video <U+2013> Music clip installation series looks behind the camera|url=http://www.eyeweekly.com/film/feature/article/65383|publisher=Torstar|work=Eye Weekly|date=July 8, 2009|archiveurl=http://archives.eyeweekly.com/feature/article/65383 |archivedate=November 20, 2011|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}</ref>

"Single Ladies" was nominated for nine awards at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, ultimately winning three including Video of the Year. Its failure to win the Best Female Video category, which went to American [[country pop]] singer [[Taylor Swift]]'s "[[You Belong with Me]]", sparked controversy during the ceremony. Swift's acceptance speech was interrupted by rapper [[Kanye West]], who grabbed her microphone to declare the "Single Ladies" video as "one of the best videos of all time".<ref name="rant"/> When Knowles won the Video of the Year award later that night, she reminisced about when she won her first MTV award with her former band, [[Destiny's Child]], and called the experience "one of the most exciting moments in [her] life".
