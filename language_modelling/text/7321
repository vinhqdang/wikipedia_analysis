'''Pericles''' or '''Perikles''' (ca. [[495 BC|495]]<U+2013>[[429 BC]], [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{polytonic|'''<U+03A0><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03BB><U+1FC6><U+03C2>'''}}, meaning "surrounded by glory") was a prominent and influential [[statesman]], orator, and general of [[History of Athens|Athens]] in the city's [[Golden Age]] (specifically, between the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian]] and [[Peloponnesian War|Peloponnesian]] wars). He was descended, through his mother, from the [[Alcmaeonidae|Alcmaeonid]] family.

Pericles had such a profound influence on Athenian society that [[Thucydides]], his contemporary historian, acclaimed him as "the first citizen of Athens". Pericles turned the [[Delian League]] into an Athenian empire and led his countrymen during the first two years of the Peloponnesian War. The period during which he led Athens, roughly from [[461 BC]] to [[429 BC]], is sometimes known as the "[[Age of Pericles]]," though the period thus denoted can include times as early as the [[Persian Wars]], or as late as the next century.

Pericles promoted the arts and literature; this was a chief reason Athens holds the reputation of being the educational and cultural centre of the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] world. He started an ambitious project that built most of the surviving structures on the [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]] (including the [[Parthenon]]). This project beautified the city, exhibited its glory, and gave work to the people.<ref name="Blois">L. de Blois, ''An Introduction to the Ancient World'', 99</ref> Furthermore, Pericles fostered [[Athenian democracy]] to such an extent that critics call him a [[populism|populist]].<ref name="Muhl">S. Muhlberger, [http://www.nipissingu.ca/department/history/MUHLBERGER/2055/L23ANC.HTM Periclean Athens].</ref><ref name = "Ruden 80">S. Ruden, ''Lysistrata'', 80.</ref>

==Early years==
Pericles was born at  about [[495 BC]], in the [[deme]] of [[Cholargos]] just north of [[Athens]].{{Cref|<U+03B1>}} He was the son of the politician [[Xanthippus]], who, although [[ostracism|ostracized]] in 485<U+2013>4 BC, returned to Athens to command the Athenian contingent in the Greek victory at [[Battle of Mycale|Mycale]] just five years later. Pericles' mother, [[Agariste]], was a scion of the powerful and controversial noble family of the Alcmaeonidae, and her familial connections played a crucial role in starting Xanthippus' political career. Agariste was the great-granddaughter of the tyrant of [[Sicyon]], [[Cleisthenes of Sicyon|Cleisthenes]], and the niece of the Supreme Athenian reformer [[Cleisthenes]], another Alcmaeonid.{{Cref|<U+03B2>}}<ref name="Br">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Pericles|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica|date=2002}}</ref> According to [[Herodotus]] and [[Plutarch]], Agariste dreamed, a few nights before Pericles' birth, that she had borne a lion.<ref name="Her">Herodotus, VI, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hdt%2e+6%2e131/ 131].</ref><ref name="Pl3">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#3|III]].</ref> One interpretation of the anecdote treats the lion as a traditional symbol of greatness, but the story may also allude to the unusual size of Pericles' skull, which became a popular target of contemporary comedians.<ref name="Pl3" /><ref name="Ehr239">V.L. Ehrenberg, ''From Solon to Socrates'', a239.</ref> (Although Plutarch claims that this deformity was the reason that Pericles was always depicted wearing a helmet, this is not the case; the helmet was actually the symbol of his official rank as [[strategos]] (general)).<ref name="Cunn">L.

It is called a democracy, because not the few but the many govern. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if to social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition."

Pericles belonged to the local [[tribe]] of Acamantis ({{Polytonic|''<U+1F08><U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+1F76><U+03C2> <U+03C6><U+03C5><U+03BB><U+1F74>''}}). His early years were quiet; the introverted, young Pericles avoided public appearances, preferring to devote his time to his studies.<ref name="Helios">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Pericles|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia The Helios|date=1952}}</ref>

His family's nobility and wealth allowed him to fully pursue his inclination toward education. He learned music from the masters of the time ([[Damon (ancient Greek musicologist)|Damon]] or Pythocleides could have been his teachers)<ref name="P4">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#4|IV]]</ref><ref name="PlatoA">Plato, ''Alcibiades I'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plat%2e+Alc%2e+1+118c/ 118c]</ref> and he is considered to have been the first politician to attribute great importance to [[philosophy]].<ref name="Helios" /> He enjoyed the company of the [[philosopher]]s [[Protagoras]], [[Zeno of Elea]], and [[Anaxagoras]]. Anaxagoras in particular became a close friend and influenced him greatly.<ref name="P4" /><ref name="Mend1">M. Mendelson, ''Many Sides'', 1</ref> Pericles' manner of thought and rhetorical charisma may have been in part products of Anaxagoras<U+2019> emphasis on emotional calm in the face of trouble and scepticism about divine phenomena.<ref name="Br" /> His proverbial calmness and self-control are also regarded as products of Anaxagoras' influence.<ref name="PP6">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#6|VI]] and Plato, Phaedrus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plat%2e+Phaedrus+270a/ 270a]</ref>

==Political career until 431 BC==
===Entering politics===
In the spring of 472 , Pericles presented the ''[[Persae]]'' of [[Aeschylus]] at the [[Greater Dionysia]] as a [[Liturgy#etymology|liturgy]], demonstrating that he was then one of the wealthier men of Athens.<ref name="Br">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Pericles|encyclopedia=Oxford Classical Dictionary|date=1996}}</ref> Simon Hornblower has argued that Pericles' selection of this play, which presents a nostalgic picture of [[Themistocles]]' famous victory at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], shows that the young politician was supporting Themistocles against his political opponent Cimon, whose faction succeeded in having Themistocles ostracized shortly afterwards.<ref>S. Hornblower,  ''The Greek World, 479<U+2013>323 BC'', 33<U+2013>4</ref>

Plutarch says that Pericles stood first among the Athenians for forty years. <ref name="Pl6">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#16|XVI]]</ref> If this was so, Pericles must have taken up a position of leadership by the early 460s BC. Throughout these years he endeavored to protect his privacy and tried to present himself as a model for his fellow citizens. For example, he would often avoid banquets, trying to be frugal.<ref name="Pl7-9">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#7|VII]].</ref><ref name = "Plutarch IX">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#9|IX]].</ref>

In [[463 BC]] Pericles was the leading prosecutor of [[Cimon]], the leader of the conservative faction, who was accused of neglecting Athens' vital interests in [[Macedon]].<ref name="Ar27"> Aristotle, ''Constitution of Athens'', {{Athpol|27}}</ref> Although Cimon was acquitted, this confrontation proved that Pericles' major political opponent was vulnerable.<ref name="Cimon">Plutarch, ''Cimon'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0181:text=Cim.:chapter=15:section=1/  XV]</ref>

===Ostracizing Cimon===
[[Image:Cholargus.JPG|thumb|left|A modern statue of Pericles in modern [[Cholargos]] (Pericles' avenue). The name of the suburb dates to ancient Athens, but the ancient deme of Cholargos, which belonged to the tribe of Acamantis, was near modern [[Kamatero]] or [[Peristeri]].]]

Around [[462 BC]]-[[461 BC]] the leadership of the democratic party decided it was time to take aim at the [[Areopagus]], a traditional council controlled by the Athenian aristocracy, which had once been the most powerful body in the state.<ref name="For">Fornara-Samons, ''Athens from Cleisthenes to Pericles'', [http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft2p30058m&chunk.id=d0e2016&toc.depth=1&toc.id=d0e2016&brand=eschol/ 24-25]</ref> The leader of the party and mentor of Pericles, [[Ephialtes of Athens|Ephialtes]], proposed a sharp reduction of the Areopagus<U+2019> powers. The [[ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]] (the Athenian Assembly) adopted Ephialtes' proposal without strong opposition.<ref name="Pl9">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#9|IX]]</ref> This reform signalled the commencement of a new era of "radical democracy".<ref name="For" /> The democratic party gradually became dominant in Athenian politics and Pericles seemed willing to follow a populist policy in order to cajole the public. According to [[Aristotle]], Pericles' stance can be explained by the fact that his principal political opponent, Cimon, was rich and generous, and was able to secure public favor by lavishly bestowing his sizable personal fortune.<ref name="Ar27">Aristotle, ''Constitution of Athens'', {{Athpol|27}}</ref> The historian Loren J. Samons II argues, however, that Pericles had enough resources to make a political mark by private means, had he so chosen.<ref name="Samons80"> L.J. Samons, ''What's Wrong with Democracy?'', 80</ref>

In 461 BC, Pericles achieved the political elimination of this formidable opponent using the weapon of [[ostracism]]. The ostensible accusation was that Cimon betrayed his city by acting as a friend of [[Sparta]].<ref name="Cim16">Plutarch, ''Cimon'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plut%2e+Cim%2e+16%2e2/ XVI]</ref> 

Even after Cimon's ostracism, Pericles continued to espouse and promote a populist social policy.<ref name="Pl9" /> He first proposed a decree that permitted the poor to watch theatrical plays without paying, with the state covering the cost of their admission. With other decrees he lowered the property requirement for the [[archon|archonship]] in [[458 BC]]-[[457 BC]] and bestowed generous wages on all citizens who served as jurymen in the [[Heliaia]] (the supreme court of Athens) some time just after [[454 BC]].<ref name="Fornara2">Fornara-Samons, ''Athens from Cleisthenes to Pericles'', [http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft2p30058m&chunk.id=d0e2642&toc.id=&brand=eschol/ 67-73]</ref> His most controversial measure, however, was a law of [[451 BC]] limiting Athenian citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides.<ref name="Martin"> R. Martin,  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0009%3Ahead%3D%23142/ An Overview of Classical Greek History]</ref>

Such measures impelled Pericles' critics to regard him as responsible for the gradual degeneration of the Athenian democracy. [[Constantine Paparregopoulus|Constantine Paparrigopoulos]], a major modern Greek historian, argues that Pericles sought for the expansion and stabilization of all democratic institutions.<ref name="Papar">K. Paparrigopoulos, ''History of the Greek Nation'', Ab, 145</ref> Hence, he enacted legislation granting the lower classes access to the political system and the public offices, from which they had previously been barred on account of limited means or humble birth.<ref name="ConP">Aristotle, ''Constitution of Athens'', {{Athpol|24}} and ''Politics'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0058:book=2:section=1274a 1274a]</ref> According to Samons, Pericles believed that it was necessary to raise the demos, in which he saw an untapped source of Athenian power and the crucial element of Athenian military dominance.<ref name="Samons65"> L.J. Samons, ''What's Wrong with Democracy?'', 65</ref> (The fleet, backbone of Athenian power since the days of Themistocles, was manned almost entirely by members of the lower classes.<ref name="Fine377-378">Fine, ''The Ancient Greeks'', 377-8</ref>)

Cimon, on the other hand, apparently believed that no further free space for democratic evolution existed. He was certain that democracy had reached its peak and Pericles<U+2019> reforms were leading to the stalemate of populism. According to Paparrigopoulos, history vindicated Cimon, because Athens, after Pericles' death, sank into the abyss of political turmoil and demagogy. Paparrigopoulos maintains that an unprecedented regression descended upon the city, whose glory perished as a result of Pericles' populist policies.<ref name="Papar" /> According to another historian, Justin Daniel King, radical democracy benefited people individually, but harmed the state.<ref name="King24">J.D. King, {{PDFlink|[http://www.vu.union.edu/~kingj/classics.pdf Athenian Democracy and Empire]|135&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 139047 bytes -->}}, 24-25</ref> On the other hand, [[Donald Kagan]] asserts that the democratic measures Pericles put into effect provided the basis for an unassailable political strength.<ref name="Out79">D. Kagan, ''The Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War'', 79</ref> After all, Cimon finally accepted the new democracy and did not oppose the citizenship law, after he returned from exile in 451 BC.<ref name="Kagan135-136">D. Kagan, ''The Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War'', 135-136</ref>

===Leading Athens===
Ephialtes' murder in 461 BC paved the way for Pericles to consolidate his authority.{{Cref|<U+03B4>}} Lacking any robust opposition after the expulsion of Cimon, the unchallengeable leader of the democratic party became the unchallengeable ruler of Athens. He remained in power almost uninterruptedly until his death in 429 BC.
 
====First Peloponnesian War====
{{main|First Peloponnesian War}}

Pericles made his first military excursions during the First Peloponnesian War, which was caused in part by Athens' alliance with [[Megara]] and [[Argos]] and the subsequent reaction of Sparta. In [[454 BC]] he attacked [[Sicyon]] and [[Acarnania]].<ref name="Th111">Thucydides, [[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 1#1:111|1.111]]</ref> He then unsuccessfully tried to take Oeniadea on the Corinthian gulf, before returning to Athens.<ref name="Rhodes44">P.J. Rhodes, ''A History of the Classical Greek World'', 44</ref> In 451 BC, Cimon is said to have returned from exile and negotiated a five years' truce with Sparta after a proposal of Pericles, an event which indicates a shift in Pericles' political strategy.<ref name="Cimon17">Plutarch, ''Cimon'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0182&layout=&loc=Cim.+17.1 XVII]</ref> Pericles may have realized the importance of Cimon's contribution during the ongoing conflicts against the Peloponnesians and the [[Persians]]. Anthony J. Podlecki argues, however, that Pericles' alleged change of position was invented by ancient writers to support "a tendentious view of Pericles' shiftiness".<ref name="Podlecki44">A.J. Podlecki, ''Perikles and his Circle'', 44</ref>

Plutarch states that Cimon struck a power-sharing deal with his opponents, and doing a "weridos" life. according to which Pericles would carry through the interior affairs and Cimon would be the leader of the Athenian army, campaigning abroad.<ref name="P10">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#10|X]]</ref> If it was actually made, this bargain would constitute a concession on Pericles' part that he was not a great strategist. Kagan believes that Cimon adapted himself to the new conditions and promoted a political marriage between Periclean liberals and Cimonian conservatives.<ref name=Kagan135-136 />

In the mid 450s the Athenians launched an unsuccessful attempt to aid an Egyptian revolt against Persia, which led to a prolonged siege of a Persian fortress in the [[Nile]] Delta. The campaign culminated in a disaster on a very large scale; the besieging force was defeated and destroyed.<ref name="Libourel615">J.M. Libourel, ''The Athenian Disaster in Egypt'', 605<U+2013>15</ref> In 451<U+2013>450 BC the Athenians sent troops to [[Cyprus]]. Cimon defeated the Persians in the [[Battle of Salamis (in Cyprus)|Battle of Salamis]], but died of disease in [[449 BC]]. Pericles is said to have initiated both expeditions in Egypt and Cyprus,<ref name="Aird52">H. Aird, ''Pericles: The Rise and Fall of Athenian Democracy'', 52</ref> although some researchers, such as Karl Julius Beloch, argue that the dispatch of such a great fleet conforms with the spirit of Cimon's policy.<ref name="Beloch205">K.J. Beloch, ''Griechische Geschichte'', II, 205</ref> 

Complicating the account of this complex period is the issue of the [[Peace of Callias]], which allegedly ended hostilities between the Greeks and the Persians.  The very existence of the treaty is hotly disputed, and its particulars and negotiation are equally ambiguous.<ref name="Fine359-361">J. Fine, ''The Ancient Greeks'', 359<U+2013>361.</ref> Ernst Badian believes that a peace between Athens and Persia was first ratified in 463 BC (making the Athenian interventions in Egypt and Cyprus violations of the peace), and renegotiated at the conclusion of the campaign in Cyprus, taking force again by 449<U+2013>448 BC.<ref name="Badian">E. Badian, ''The Peace of Callias'', 1<U+2013>39.</ref> John Fine, on the other hand, suggests that the first peace between Athens and Persia was concluded in 450<U+2013>449 BC, as a result of Pericles' strategic calculation that ongoing conflict with Persia was undermining Athens' ability to spread its influence in Greece and the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].<ref name="Fine359-361" /> Kagan believes that Pericles used [[Callias]], a brother-in-law of Cimon, as a symbol of unity and employed him several times to negotiate important agreements.<ref name="Out108">D. Kagan, ''The Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War'', 108.</ref>

In the spring of 449 BC, Pericles proposed the Congress Decree, which led to a meeting ("Congress") of all Greek states in order to consider the question of rebuilding the temples destroyed by the Persians. The Congress failed because of Sparta's stance, but Pericles' real intentions remain unclear.<ref name="Pl17">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#17|XVII]]</ref> Some historians think that he wanted to prompt some kind of confederation with the participation of all the Greek cities, others think he wanted to assert Athenian pre-eminence.<ref name="Wade212">Wade-Grey, ''The Question of Tribute in 449/8 B. C.'', 212<U+2013>29.</ref> According to the historian Terry Buckley the objective of the Congress Decree was a new mandate for the [[Delian League]] and for the collection of "phoros" (taxes).<ref name="Buckley">T.

During the [[Second Sacred War]] Pericles led the Athenian army against [[Delphi]] and reinstated [[Phocis]] in its sovereign rights on the [[oracle]].<ref name="ThPl112">Thucydides, [[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 1#1:112|1.112]] and Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#21|XXI]]</ref> In [[447 BC]] Pericles engaged in his most admired excursion, the expulsion of barbarians from the Thracian peninsula of [[Gallipoli]], in order to establish Athenian colonists in the region.<ref name="Br" /><ref name="Pl19">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#19|XIX]]</ref> 
At this time, however, Athens was seriously challenged by a number of revolts among its allies (or, to be more accurate, its subjects). In [[447 BC]] the oligarchs of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] conspired against the democratic faction. The Athenians demanded their immediate surrender, but, after the [[Battle of Coronea (447 BC)|Battle of Coronea]], Pericles was forced to concede the loss of Boeotia in order to recover the prisoners taken in that battle.<ref name="Helios" /> With Boeotia in hostile hands, Phocis and Locris became untenable and quickly fell under the control of hostile oligarchs.<ref name="Fine368-369">Fine, ''The Ancient Greeks'', 368<U+2013>69.</ref> In [[446 BC]], a more dangerous uprising erupted. [[Euboea]] and [[Megara]] revolted. Pericles crossed over to Euboea with his troops, but was forced to return when the Spartan army invaded [[Attica]]. Through bribery and negotiations, Pericles defused the imminent threat, and the Spartans returned home.<ref name="ThAr">Thucydides, [History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 2#2:21|2.21]] and Aristophanes, ''The Acharnians'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0023;query=card%3D%2340;layout=;loc=836 832]</ref> When Pericles was later audited for the handling of public money, an expenditure of 10 [[Greek talent|talents]] was not sufficiently justified, since the official documents just referred that the money was spent for a "very serious purpose". Nonetheless, the "serious purpose" (namely the bribery) was so obvious to the auditors that they approved the expenditure without official meddling and without even investigating the mystery.<ref name="P23">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#23|XXIII]]</ref> After the Spartan threat had been removed, Pericles crossed back to Euboea to crush the revolt there. He then inflicted a stringent punishment on the landowners of [[Chalcis]], who lost their properties. The residents of [[Istiaia]], meanwhile, who had butchered the crew of an Athenian [[trireme]], were uprooted and replaced by 2,000 Athenian settlers.<ref name="P23" /> The crisis was brought to an official end by the Thirty Years' Peace (winter of 446<U+2013>[[445 BC]]), in which Athens relinquished most of the possessions and interests on the Greek mainland which it had acquired since 460 BC, and both Athens and Sparta agreed not to attempt to win over the other state's allies.<ref name="Fine368-369" />

====Final battle with the conservatives====
In [[444 BC]], the conservative and the democratic faction confronted each other in a fierce struggle. The ambitious new leader of the conservatives, [[Thucydides (politician)|Thucydides]] (not to be confused with the historian of the same name), accused Pericles of profligacy, criticizing the way he spent the money for the ongoing building plan. Thucydides managed, initially, to incite the passions of the ecclesia in his favor, but, when Pericles, the leader of the democrats, took the floor, he put the conservatives in the shade. Pericles responded resolutely, proposing to reimburse the city for all the expenses from his private property, under the term that he would make the inscriptions of dedication in his own name.<ref name="Pl4">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#14|XIV]]</ref> His stance was greeted with applause, and Thucydides suffered an unexpected defeat. In [[442 BC]], the Athenian public ostracized Thucydides for 10 years and Pericles was once again the unchallenged [[suzerain]] of the Athenian political arena.<ref name="Pl4" />

====Athens' rule over its alliance====
Pericles wanted to stabilize Athens' dominance over its alliance and to enforce its pre-eminence in Greece. The process by which the Delian League transformed into an Athenian empire is generally considered to have begun well before Pericles' time,<ref name="Buckley196">T. Buckley, ''Aspects of Greek History 750<U+2013>323 BC'', 196.</ref> as various allies in the league chose to pay tribute to Athens instead of manning ships for the league's fleet, but the transformation was speeded and brought to its conclusion by measures implemented by Pericles.<ref name="Butler195">H. Butler, ''The Story of Athens'', 195</ref> The final steps in the shift to empire may have been triggered by Athens' defeat in Egypt, which challenged the city's dominance in the Aegean and led to the revolt of several allies, such as [[Miletus]] and [[Erythrae]].<ref name="Out98">D.

It was from the alliance's treasury that Pericles drew the funds necessary to enable his ambitious building plan, centered on the "Periclean Acropolis", which included the [[Propylaea]], the Parthenon and the golden statue of Athena, sculpted by Pericles<U+2019> friend, [[Phidias]].<ref name="Hurwit87">J.

====Samian War====
[[Image:Pericles6.jpg|thumb|right|A 20 drachma coin of the [[Greece|Hellenic Republic]] picturing Pericles]]
{{main|Samian War}} 
The Samian War was the last significant military event before the Peloponnesian War. After Thucydides' ostracism, Pericles was re-elected yearly to the generalship, the only office he ever officially occupied, although his influence was so great as to make him the ''de facto'' ruler of the state. In [[440 BC]] [[Samos Island|Samos]] was at war with [[Miletus]] over control of [[Priene]], an ancient city of [[Ionia]] on the foot-hills of [[Mycale]]. Worsted in the war, the Milesians came to Athens to plead their case against the Samians.<ref name="Th115">Thucydides, [[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 1#1:115|1.115]]</ref> When the Athenians ordered the two sides to stop fighting and submit the case to arbitration at Athens, the Samians refused.<ref name="Pl25">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#25|XXV]]</ref> In response, Pericles passed a decree dispatching an expedition to Samos, "alleging against its people that, though they were ordered to break off their war against the Milesians, they were not complying".{{Cref|<U+03B5>}} In a naval battle the Athenians led by Pericles and the other nine generals defeated the forces of Samos and imposed on the island an administration pleasing to them.<ref name="Pl25" /> When the Samians revolted against Athenian rule, Pericles compelled the rebels to capitulate after a tough siege of eight months, which resulted in substantial discontent among the Athenian sailors.<ref name="Pl28">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#28|XXVIII]]</ref> Pericles then quelled a revolt in [[Byzantium]] and, when he returned to Athens, he gave a funeral oration to honor the soldiers who died in the expedition.<ref name="Sealey310&;quot;>R. Sealey, ''A History of the Greek City States'', 310</ref>

Between [[438 BC]]-[[436 BC]] Pericles led Athens' fleet in [[Pontus]] and established friendly relations with the Greek cities of the region.<ref name="Pontus">C.J. Tuplin, ''Pontus and the Outside World'', 28</ref> Pericles focused also on internal projects, such as the fortification of Athens (the building of the "middle wall" about 440 BC), and on the creation of new [[cleruchy|cleruchies]], such as [[Andros]], [[Naxos]] and [[Thurii]] ([[444 BC]]) as well as [[Amphipolis]] ([[437 BC]]-[[436 BC]]).<ref name="PlPl11">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#11|XI]] and Plato, ''Gorgias'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0178;query=section%3D%23491;layout=;loc=Gorg.%20456a 455e]</ref>

====Personal attacks====
[[Image:Aspasie Pio-Clementino Inv272.jpg|thumb|Aspasia of Miletus (c.[[469 BC]]<U+2013>c.[[406 BC]]), Pericles' companion]]

Pericles and his friends were never immune from attack, as preeminence in democratic Athens was not equivalent to absolute rule.<ref name="For2">Fornara-Samons, ''Athens from Cleisthenes to Pericles'', [http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft2p30058m&chunk.id=d0e2016&toc.depth=1&toc.id=d0e2016&brand=eschol/ 31]</ref> Just before the eruption of the Peloponnesian war, Pericles and two of his closest associates, Phidias and his companion, [[Aspasia]], faced a series of personal and judicial attacks. 

Phidias, who had been in charge of all building projects, was first accused of embezzling gold intended for the statue of [[Athena]] and then of impiety, because, when he wrought the battle of the [[Amazons]] on the shield of Athena, he carved out a figure that suggested himself as a bald old man, and also inserted a very fine likeness of Pericles fighting with an Amazon.<ref name="P31">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#31|XXXI]]</ref> Pericles' enemies also found a false witness against Phidias, named Menon. 

Aspasia, who was noted for her ability as a conversationalist and adviser, was accused of corrupting the women of Athens in order to satisfy Pericles' perversions.<ref name="SudaAsp">Suda, article [http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?login=guest&enlogin=guest&db=REAL&field=adlerhw_gr&searchstr=alpha,4202 Aspasia]</ref><ref name="P32">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#32|XXXII]]</ref> Aspasia was probably a [[hetaera]] and ran a [[brothel]],<ref name="Ar523">Aristophanes, ''Acharnians'',  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0240&layout=&loc=523 523-527]</ref><ref name="Just">R.

Although Aspasia was acquitted thanks to a rare emotional outburst of Pericles, his friend, Phidias, died in prison and another friend of his, Anaxagoras, was attacked by the [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|ecclesia]] for his religious beliefs.<ref name="P31" />     

Beyond these initial prosecutions, the ecclesia attacked Pericles himself by asking him to justify his ostensible profligacy with, and maladministration of, public money.<ref name="P32" /> According to Plutarch, Pericles was so afraid of the oncoming trial that he did not let the Athenians yield to the [[Lacedaemonians]].<ref name="P32" /> Beloch also believes that Pericles deliberately brought on the war to protect his political position at home.<ref name="Beloch19-22">K.J. Beloch, ''Die Attische Politik seit Perikles'', 19-22</ref> Thus, at the start of the Peloponnesian War, Athens found itself in the awkward position of entrusting its future to a leader whose preeminence had just been seriously shaken for the first time in over a decade.<ref name="Helios" />

==Peloponnesian War==
{{main|Peloponnesian War}} 

The causes of the Peloponnesian War have been much debated, but most ancient historians laid the blame on Pericles and Athens. Plutarch seems to believe that Pericles and the Athenians incited the war, scrambling to implement their belligerent tactics "with a sort of arrogance and a love of strife".{{Cref|<U+03C3><U+03C4>}} Thucydides hints at the same thing; although he is generally regarded as an admirer of Pericles, Thucydides has, at this point, been criticised for bias towards [[Sparta]].{{Cref|<U+03B6>}}

===Prelude to the war===
[[Image:Anaxagoras and Pericles.jpg|thumb|right|Anaxagoras and Pericles by Augustin-Louis Belle (1757<U+2013>1841)]]

Pericles was convinced that the war against Sparta, which could not conceal its envy of Athens' pre-eminence, was inevitable if not to be welcomed.<ref name="Podlecki158">A.J. Podlecki, ''Perikles and his Circle'', 158</ref> Therefore he did not hesitate to send troops to [[Corcyra]] to reinforce the Corcyraean fleet, which was fighting against [[Corinth]].<ref name="Th31-54">Thucydides, [[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 1#1:31|1.31<U+2013>54]]</ref> In [[433 BC]] the enemy fleets confronted each other at the [[Battle of Sybota]] and a year later the Athenians fought Corinthian colonists at the [[Battle of Potidaea]]; these two events contributed greatly to Corinth's lasting hatred of Athens. During the same period, Pericles proposed the [[Megarian decree|Megarian Decree]], which resembled a modern trade embargo. According to the provisions of the decree, Megarian merchants were excluded from the market of Athens and the ports in its empire. This ban strangled the Megarian economy and strained the fragile peace between Athens and Sparta, which was allied with Megara. According to George Cawkwell, a [[praelector]] in [[ancient history]], with this decree Pericles breached the Thirty Years Peace "but, perhaps, not without the semblance of an excuse".<ref name="Cawkwell">G. Cawkwell, ''Thucydides and the Peloponnesian War'', 33</ref> The Athenians' justification was that the Megarians had cultivated the sacred land consecrated to [[Demeter]] and had given refuge to runaway slaves, a behavior which the Athenians considered to be impious.<ref name="Buckley322">T. Buckley, ''Aspects of Greek History 750<U+2013>323 BC'', 322.</ref>

After consultations with its allies, Sparta sent a deputation to Athens demanding certain concessions, such as the immediate expulsion of the Alcmaeonidae family including Pericles and the retraction of the Megarian Decree, threatening war if the demands were not met. The obvious purpose of these proposals was the instigation of a confrontation between Pericles and the people; this event, indeed, would come about a few years later.<ref name="Th127">Thucydides, [[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 1#1:127|1.127]]</ref> At that time, the Athenians unhesitatingly followed Pericles' instructions. In the first legendary oration Thucydides puts in his mouth, Pericles advised the Athenians not to yield to their opponents' demands, since they were militarily stronger.<ref name="Th140-144">Thucydides, [[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 1#1:140|1.140<U+2013>144]]</ref> Pericles was not prepared to make unilateral concessions, believing that "if Athens conceded on that issue, then Sparta was sure to come up with further demands".<ref name="Platias100-103">A.G. Platias-C. Koliopoulos, ''Thucydides on Strategy'', 100<U+2013>03.</ref> Consequently, Pericles asked the Spartans to offer a ''quid pro quo''. In exchange for retracting the Megarian Decree, the Athenians demanded from Sparta to abandon their practice of periodic expulsion of foreigners from their territory ([[xenelasia]]) and to recognize the autonomy of its allied cities, a request implying that Sparta's hegemony was also ruthless.<ref name="Vlachos20">A. Vlachos, ''Thucydides' Bias'', 20 </ref> The terms were rejected by the Spartans, and, with neither side willing to back down, the two sides prepared for war. According to Athanasios G. Platias and Constantinos Koliopoulos, professors of strategic studies and [[international politics]], "rather than to submit to coercive demands, Pericles chose war".<ref name="Platias100-103" /> Another consideration that may well have influenced Pericles' stance was the concern that revolts in the empire might spread if Athens showed herself weak.<ref name="Ehr264">V.L. Ehrenberg, ''From Solon to Socrates'', 264.</ref>

===First year of the war (431 BC)===
[[Image:Parthenon_from_south.jpg|thumb|left|The Parthenon, a masterpiece prompted by Pericles, from the south]]
In [[431 BC]], while peace already was precarious, [[Archidamus II]], Sparta's king, sent a new delegation to Athens, demanding that the Athenians submit to Sparta's demands. This deputation was not allowed to enter Athens, as Pericles had already passed a resolution according to which no Spartan deputation would be welcomed if the Spartans had previously initiated any hostile military actions. The Spartan army was at this time gathered at Corinth, and, citing this as a hostile action, the Athenians refused to admit their emissaries.<ref name="ThII12">Thucydides, [[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 2#2:12|2.12]]</ref> With his last attempt at negotiation thus declined, Archidamus invaded [[Attica]], but found no Athenians there; Pericles, aware that Sparta's strategy would be to invade and ravage Athenian territory, had previously arranged to evacuate the entire population of the region to within the walls of Athens.<ref name="ThII14">Thucydides, [[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 2#2:14|2.14]]</ref>

No definite record exists of how exactly Pericles managed to convince the residents of Attica to agree to move into the crowded urban areas. For most, the move meant abandoning their land and ancestral shrines and completely changing their lifestyle.<ref name="OberCh6">J. Ober, ''The Athenian Revolution'', 72-85</ref>  Therefore, although they agreed to leave, many rural residents were far from happy with Pericles' decision.<ref name="ThII16">Thucydides, [[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 2#2:16|2.16]]</ref> Pericles also gave his compatriots some advice on their present affairs and reassured them that, if the enemy did not plunder his farms, he would offer his property to the city. This promise was prompted by his concern that Archidamus, who was a friend of his, might pass by his estate without ravaging it, either as a gesture of friendship or as a calculated political move aimed to alienate Pericles from his constituents.<ref name="ThII13">Thucydides, [[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 2#2:13|2.13]]</ref>

In any case, seeing the pillage of their farms, the Athenians were outraged, and they soon began to indirectly express their discontent towards their leader, who many of them considered to have drawn them into the war. Even in the face of mounting pressure, Pericles did not give in to the demands for immediate action against the enemy or revise his initial strategy. He also avoided convening the ecclesia, fearing that the populace, outraged by the unopposed ravaging of their farms, might rashly decide to challenge the vaunted Spartan army in the field.<ref name="ThII22">Thucydides, [[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 2#2:22|2.22]]</ref> As meetings of the assembly were called at the discretion of its rotating presidents, the "prytanies", Pericles had no formal control over their scheduling; rather, the respect in which Pericles was held by the prytanies was apparently sufficient to persuade them to do as he wished.<ref name="KaganPe69">D. Kagan, ''The Peloponnesian War'', 69</ref> While the Spartan army remained in Attica, Pericles sent a fleet of 100 ships to loot the coasts of the [[Peloponnese]] and charged the cavalry to guard the ravaged farms close to the walls of the city.<ref name="ThX18">Thucydides, [[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 2#2:18|2.18]] and Xenophon(?),''Constitution of Athens'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0158;layout=;query=chapter%3D%232;loc=1.1  2]</ref> When the enemy retired and the pillaging came to an end, Pericles proposed a decree according to which the authorities of the city should put aside 1,000 talents and 100 ships, in case Athens was attacked by naval forces. According to the most stringent provision of the decree, even proposing a different use of the money or ships would entail the penalty of death. During the autumn of 431 BC, Pericles led the Athenian forces that invaded Megara and a few months later (winter of [[431 BC]]-[[430 BC]]) he delivered his monumental and emotional [[Pericles' Funeral Oration|Funeral Oration]], honoring the Athenians who died for their city.<ref name="ThII35-46">Thucydides, [[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 2#2:35|2.35-46]]</ref>

===Last military operations and death===

In 430 BC, the army of Sparta looted Attica for a second time, but Pericles was not daunted and refused to revise his initial strategy.<ref name="Thuc55">Thucydides, [[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 2#2:55|2.55]]</ref> Unwilling to engage the Spartan army in battle, he again led a naval expedition to plunder the coasts of the Peloponnese, this time taking 100 Athenian ships with him.<ref name="Thuc56">Thucydides, [History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 2#2:56|2.56]]</ref> According to Plutarch, just before the sailing of the ships an [[eclipse]] of the [[moon]] frightened the crews, but Pericles used the astronomical knowledge he had acquired from Anaxagoras to calm them.<ref name="Pl34">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#34|XXXIV]]</ref> In the summer of the same year an epidemic broke out and devastated the Athenians.<ref name="Th48-56">Thucydides, [[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 2#2:48|2.48]] and [History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 2#2:56|2.56]]</ref> The exact identity of the [[Plague of Athens|disease]] is uncertain, and has been the source of much debate.{{Cref|<U+03B7>}} In any case, the city's plight, caused by the epidemic, triggered a new wave of public uproar, and Pericles was forced to defend himself in an emotional final speech, a rendition of which is presented by Thucydides.<ref name="Thuc6064">Thucydides, [[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 2#2:60|2.60-64]]</ref> This is considered to be a  monumental oration, revealing Pericles' virtues but also his bitterness towards his compatriots' ingratitude.<ref name="Helios" /> Temporarily, he managed to tame the people's resentment and to ride out the storm, but his internal enemies' final bid to undermine him came off; they managed to deprive him of the generalship and to fine him at an amount estimated between 15 and 50 talents.<ref name="P35">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#35|XXXV]]</ref> Ancient sources mention [[Cleon]], a rising and dynamic protagonist of the Athenian political scene during the war, as the public prosecutor in Pericles' trial.<ref name="P35" />

Nevertheless, within just a year, in 429 BC, the Athenians not only forgave Pericles but also re-elected him as strategos.{{Cref|<U+03B8>}} He was reinstated in command of the Athenian army and led all its military operations during 429 BC, having once again under his control the levers of power.<ref name="Helios" /> In that year, however, Pericles witnessed the death of both his legitimate sons from his first wife, [[Xanthippus]] and his beloved [[Paralus]], in the epidemic. His morale undermined, he burst into tears and not even Aspasia's companionship could console him. He himself died of the disease in the autumn of [[429 BC]].

Just before his death, Pericles' friends were concentrated around his bed, enumerating his virtues during peace and underscoring his nine war trophies. Pericles, though moribund, heard them and interrupted them, pointing out that they forgot to mention his fairest and greatest title to their admiration; "for", said he, "no living Athenian ever put on mourning because of me".<ref name="Pl38">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#38|XXXVIII]]</ref> Pericles lived during the first two and a half years of the Peloponnesian War and, according to Thucydides, his death was a disaster for Athens, since his successors were inferior to him; they preferred to incite all the bad habits of the rabble and  followed an unstable policy, endeavoring to be popular rather than useful.<ref name="Thuc65">Thucydides, [[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 2#2:65|2.65]]</ref> With these bitter comments, Thucydides not only laments the loss of a man he admired, but he also heralds the flickering of Athens' unique glory and grandeur.

==Personal life==
Pericles, following Athenian custom, was first married to one of his closest relatives, with whom he had two sons, Xanthippus and Paralus. This marriage, however, was not a happy one, and at some point near 445 BC, Pericles divorced his wife and offered her to another husband, with the agreement of her male relatives.<ref name="Pap221">K. Paparrigopoulos, Aa, 221</ref> The name of his first wife is not known; the only information about her is that she was the wife of Hipponicus, before being married to Pericles, and the mother of Callias from this first marriage.<ref name="Pl24">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#24|XXIV]]</ref>

|}
The woman he really adored was [[Aspasia of Miletus]]. She became Pericles' mistress and they began to live together as if they were married. This relationship aroused many reactions and even Pericles' own son, Xanthippus, who had political ambitions, did not hesitate to slander his father.<ref name="Pl36">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#36|XXXVI]]</ref> Nonetheless, these persecutions did not undermine Pericles' morale, although he had to burst into tears in order to protect his beloved Aspasia when she was accused of corrupting Athenian society. His greatest personal tragedy was the death of his sister and of both his legitimate sons,  Xanthippus and Paralus, all affected by the epidemic, a calamity he never managed to overcome.
Just before his death, the Athenians allowed a change in the law of 451 BC that made his half-Athenian son with Aspasia, Pericles the younger, a citizen and legitimate heir,<ref name="Pl37">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#37|XXXVII]]</ref> a decision all the more striking in consideration that Pericles himself had proposed the law confining citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides.<ref name="Smith271">W. Smith, ''A History of Greece'', 271</ref>

==Assessments==
Pericles marked a whole era and inspired conflicting judgments about his significant decisions, which is something normal for a political personality of his magnitude.  The fact that he was at the same time a vigorous statesman, general and orator makes more complex the objective assessment of his actions.

===Political leadership===
[[Image:AGMA Ostrakon P<U+00E9>ricl<U+00E8>s.jpg|thumb|right|An [[ostracon]] with Pericles' name written on it (c. [[444 BC|444]]<U+2013>[[443 BC]]), Museum of the ancient [[Agora of Athens]].]]
 
Some contemporary scholars, for example Sarah Ruden, call Pericles a populist, a demagogue and a hawk,<ref name="Ruden">S. Ruden, ''Lysistrata'' , 80</ref> while other scholars admire his charismatic leadership. According to Plutarch, after assuming the leadership of Athens, "he was no longer the same man as before, nor alike submissive to the people and ready to yield and give in to the desires of the multitude as a steersman to the breezes".<ref name="Pl15">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#15|XV]]</ref> It is told that when his political opponent, Thucydides, was asked by Sparta's king, Archidamus, whether he or Pericles was the better fighter, Thucydides answered without any hesitation that Pericles was better, because even when he was defeated, he managed to convince the audience that he had won.<ref name="Helios" /> In matters of character, Pericles was above reproach in the eyes of the ancient historians, since "he kept himself untainted by corruption, although he was not altogether indifferent to money-making".<ref name="Pl6" />

Thucydides, an admirer of Pericles, maintains that Athens was "in name a democracy but, in fact, governed by its first citizen".<ref name="Thuc65" /> Through this comment, the historian illustrates what he perceives as Pericles' charisma to lead, convince and, sometimes, to manipulate. Although Thucydides mentions the fining of Pericles, he does not mention the accusations against Pericles but instead focuses on Pericles' integrity.{{Cref|<U+03B9>}}<ref name="Thuc65" /> On the other hand, in one of his dialogues, [[Plato]] rejects the glorification of Pericles and quotes [[Socrates]] as saying: "As far as I know, Pericles made the Athenians slothful, garrulous and avaricious, by starting the system of public fees".<ref name="Gorgias515">Plato, ''Gorgias'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0178;query=section%3D%23791;layout=;loc=Gorg.%20515d/ 515e]</ref>  
Plutarch mentions other criticism of Pericles' leadership: "many others say that the people were first led on by him into allotments of public lands, festival-grants, and distributions of fees for public services, thereby falling into bad habits, and becoming luxurious and wanton under the influence of his public measures, instead of frugal and self-sufficing".<ref name="Pl9" />

Thucydides argues that Pericles "was not carried away by the people, but he was the one guiding the people".<ref name="Thuc65" /> His judgement is not unquestioned; some 20th century critics, such as Malcolm F. McGregor and John S. Morrison, proposed that he may have been a charismatic public face acting as an advocate on the proposals of advisors, or the people themselves.<ref name="McG">M.F. McGregor, ''Government in Athens'', 122<U+2013>23.</ref><ref name="Morrison76-77">J.S. Morrison-A. W. Gomme, ''Pericles Monarchos'', 76<U+2013>77.</ref> According to King, by increasing the power of the people, the Athenians left themselves with no authoritative leader. During the Peloponnesian War, Pericles' dependence on popular support to govern was obvious.<ref name="King24" />

===Military achievements===
For more than 20 years Pericles led numerous expeditions, mainly naval ones. Being always cautious, he never undertook of his own accord a battle involving much uncertainty and peril and he did not accede to the "vain impulses of the citizens".<ref name="Pl18">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#18|XVIII]]</ref> He based his military policy on [[Themistocles]]' principle that Athens' predominance depends on its superior naval power and believed that the Peloponnesians were near-invincible on land.<ref name="Platias105">A.G. Platias-C. Koliopoulos, ''Thucydides on Strategy'', 105</ref> Pericles tried also to minimize the advantages of Sparta by rebuilding the walls of Athens. According to Josiah Ober, professor of classics in [[Princeton University]], the strategy of rebuilding  the walls radically altered the use of force in Greek international relations.<ref name="Ober254">J. Ober, ''National Ideology and Strategic Defence of the Population'', 254</ref>

During the Peloponnesian War, Pericles initiated a defensive "grand strategy" whose aim was the exhaustion of the enemy and the preservation of the ''status quo''.<ref name="Platias86,98">A.G. Platias-C. Koliopoulos, ''Thucydides on Strategy'', 98<U+2013>99.</ref> According to Platias and Koliopoulos, Athens as the strongest party did not have to beat Sparta in military terms and "chose to foil the Spartan plan for victory".<ref name="Platias86,98" /> The two basic principles of the "Periclean Grand Strategy" were the rejection of appeasement (in accordance with which he urged the Athenians not to revoke the Megarian Decree) and the avoidance of overextension.{{Cref|<U+03B9><U+03B1>}} According to Kagan, Pericles' vehement insistence that there should be no diversionary expeditions may well have resulted from the bitter memory of the Egyptian campaign, which he had allegedly supported.<ref name="Out83">D. Kagan, ''The Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War'', 83</ref> His strategy is said to have been "inherently unpopular", but Pericles managed to persuade the Athenian public to follow it.<ref name="Platias119-120">A.G. Platias-C. Koliopoulos, ''Thucydides on Strategy'', 119<U+2013>120.</ref> It is for that reason that [[Hans Delbr<U+00FC>ck]] called him one of the greatest statesmen and military leaders in history.<ref name="Delbruck">H. Delbr<U+00FC>ck, ''History of the Art of War'', I, 137</ref> Although his countrymen engaged in several aggressive actions soon after his death,<ref name="Ehr278">V.L. Ehrenberg, ''From Solon to Socrates, 278</ref> Platias and Koliopoulos argue that the Athenians remained true to the larger Periclean strategy of seeking to preserve, not expand, the empire, and did not depart from it until the Sicilian Expedition.<ref name="Platias119-120" /> For his part, Ben X. de Wet concludes his strategy would have succeeded had he lived longer.<ref name="Wet103">B. X. de Wet, ''This So-Called Defensive Policy of Pericles'', 103<U+2013>19.</ref>  

Critics of Pericles' strategy, however, have been just as numerous as its supporters. A common criticism is that Pericles was always a better politician and orator than strategist.<ref name="Pap">K. Paparrigopoulos, Aa, 241<U+2013>42.</ref> [[Donald Kagan]] called the Periclean strategy "a form of wishful thinking that failed", and Barry S. Strauss and Josiah Ober have stated that "as strategist he was a failure and deserves a share of the blame for Athens' great defeat".<ref name="Athenian54">D. Kagan, ''Athenian Strategy in the Peloponnesial War'', 54</ref><ref name="Strauss-Ober47">S. Strauss-J. Ober, ''The Anatomy of Error'', 47</ref> Kagan criticizes the Periclean strategy on four counts: first that by rejecting minor concessions it brought about war; second, that it was unforeseen by the enemy and hence lacked credibility; third, that it was too feeble to exploit any opportunities; and fourth, that it depended on Pericles for its execution and thus was bound to be abandoned after his death.<ref name="Archidamian">D. Kagan, ''The Archidamian War'', 28, 41.</ref> Kagan estimates Pericles' expenditure on his military strategy in the Peloponnesian War to be about 2,000 [[Talent (weight)|talents]] annually, and based on this figure concludes that he would only have enough money to keep the war going for three years.  He asserts that since Pericles must have known about these limitations he probably planned for a much shorter war.<ref name="KPel61-62">D. Kagan, ''The Peloponnesian War'', 61<U+2013>62.</ref> Others, such as Donald W. Knight, conclude that the strategy was too defensive and would not succeed.<ref name="Knight150-160">D. Knight, ''Thucydides and the War Strategy of Pericles'', 150<U+2013>60.</ref> 

On the other hand, Platias and Koliopoulos reject these criticisms and state that "the Athenians lost the war only when they dramatically reversed the Periclean grand strategy that explicitly disdained further conquests".<ref name="Platias138">A.G. Platias-C. Koliopoulos, ''Thucydides on Strategy'', 138</ref> It is a popular conclusion that those succeeding him lacked his abilities and character.<ref name="Samons131-132">L.J. Samons, ''What's Wrong with Democracy?'', 131<U+2013>32.</ref>

===Oratorical skill===
[[Image:Illus0362.jpg|left|thumb|Painting of Hector Leroux (1682<U+2013>1740), which portrays Pericles and Aspasia, admiring the gigantic statue of Athena in Phidias' studio.]]
Thucydides' modern commentators are still trying to unravel the puzzle of Pericles' orations and to figure out if the wording belongs to the Athenian statesman or the historian.{{Cref|<U+03B9><U+03B2>}} Since Pericles never wrote down or distributed his orations,{{Cref|<U+03B9><U+03B3>}} no historians are able answer this with certainty; Thucydides recreated three of them from memory and, thereby, it cannot be ascertained that he did not add his own notions and thoughts.{{Cref|<U+03B9><U+03B4>}} Although Pericles was a main source of his inspiration, some historians have noted that the passionate and idealistic literary style of the speeches Thucydides attributes to Pericles is completely at odds with Thucydides' own cold and analytical writing style.{{Cref|<U+03B9><U+03B5>}} This might, however, be the result of the incorporation of the genre of rhetoric into the genre of historiography. That is to say, Thucydides could simply have used two different writing styles for two different purposes.

Kagan states that Pericles adopted "an elevated mode of speech, free from the vulgar and knavish tricks of mob-orators" and, according to [[Diodorus Siculus]], he "excelled all his fellow citizens in skill of oratory".<ref name="War">D. Kagan, [http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?z=y&ean=9780641654695&displayonly=EXC The Peloponnesian War]</ref><ref>Diodorus, XII, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084;query=chapter%3D%23207;layout=;loc=12.40.1  39]</ref> According to [[Plutarch]], he avoided using gimmicks in his speeches, unlike the passionate [[Demosthenes]], and always spoke in a calm and tranquil manner.<ref name="Plutarch5">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#5|V]]</ref> The biographer points out, however, that the poet [[Ion of Chios|Ion]] reported that Pericles' speaking style was "a presumptuous and somewhat arrogant manner of address, and that into his haughtiness there entered a good deal of disdain and contempt for others".<ref name="Plutarch5" /> [[Gorgias]], in Plato's homonymous dialogue, uses Pericles as an example of powerful oratory.<ref name="Gorgias455d">Plato, ''Gorgias'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0178;query=section%3D%23490;layout=;loc=Gorg.%20455e 455d]</ref> In [[Menexenus]], however, Socrates casts aspersions on Pericles' rhetorical fame, claiming ironically that, since Pericles was educated by Aspasia, a trainer of many orators, he would be superior in rhetoric to someone educated by [[Antiphon (person)|Antiphon]].<ref name="Menexenus">Plato, ''Menexenus'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0180;layout=;query=section%3D%23255;loc=Menex.%20235e 236a]</ref> He also attributes authorship of the Funeral Oration to Aspasia and attacks his contemporaries' veneration of Pericles.<ref name="Monoson">S. Monoson, ''Plato's Democratic Entanglements'', 182-186</ref>

Ancient Greek writers call Pericles "Olympian" and vaunt his talents; referring to him "thundering and lightening and exciting Greece" and carrying the weapons of Zeus when orating.<ref name="ArDi">Aristophanes, ''Acharnians'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0240;query=card%3D%2326;layout=;loc=541/ 528-531] and Diodorus, XII, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0083;query=chapter%3D%23208;layout=;loc=12.41.1/ 40]</ref> According to [[Quintilian]], Pericles would always prepare assiduously for his orations and, before going on the rostrum, he would always pray to the Gods, so as not to utter any improper word.<ref name="Qui">Quintilian, ''Institutiones'', [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/quintilian/quintilian.institutio12.shtml XII, 9]</ref><ref name="Pl8">Plutarch, Pericles, [[s:Lives/Pericles#6|VIII]]</ref> [[Richard Claverhouse Jebb|Sir Richard C. Jebb]] concludes that "unique as an Athenian statesman, Pericles must have been in two respects unique also as an Athenian orator; first, because he occupied such a position of personal ascendancy as no man before or after him attained; secondly, because his thoughts and his moral force won him such renown for eloquence as no one else ever got from Athenians".<ref name="Jebb">Sir Richard C. Jebb, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0077%3Ahead%3D%2336/ The Attic Orators]</ref>

===Legacy===

Pericles' most visible legacy can be found in the literary and artistic works of his Golden Age, most of which survive to this day. The Acropolis, though in ruins, still stands and is a symbol of modern Athens. Paparrigopoulos wrote that these masterpieces are "sufficient to render the name of Greece immortal in our world".<ref name="Pap" /> 

In politics, Victor L. Ehrenberg argues that a basic element of Pericles' legacy is Athenian imperialism, which denies true democracy and freedom to the people of all but the ruling state.<ref name="Ehren332">V. L. Ehrenberg, ''From Solon to Socrates'', 332</ref> The promotion of such an arrogant imperialism is said to have ruined Athens.<ref name="Starr">C.G. Starr, ''A History of the Ancient World'', 306</ref> Nonetheless, other analysts maintain an Athenian humanism illustrated in the Golden Age.<ref name="Power">E.J. Power, ''A Legacy of Learning'', 52</ref> The freedom of expression is regarded as the lasting legacy deriving from this period.<ref name="Katula18">R.A. Katula, ''A Synoptic History of Classical Rhetoric'', 18</ref> Pericles is lauded as "the [[ideal type]] of the perfect statesman in ancient Greece" and his Funeral Oration is nowadays synonymous with the struggle for participatory democracy and civic pride.<ref name= "Pap" /><ref name="Mattson32">K.
