Various theorists have espoused legal philosophies similar to anarcho-capitalism. The first person to use the term, however, was [[Murray Rothbard]], who in the mid-20th century synthesized elements from the [[Austrian School|Austrian School of economics]], [[classical liberalism]], and 19th-century American [[individualist anarchist]]s [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Benjamin Tucker]] (while rejecting their [[labor theory of value]] and the norms they derived from it).<ref>"A student and disciple of the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, Rothbard combined the laissez-faire economics of his teacher with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state he had absorbed from studying the individualist American anarchists of the 19th century such as Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker."

Anarcho-capitalists are distinguished from [[minarchist]]s, who advocate a small [[night-watchman state]] limited to the function of individual protection, and other anarchists who often seek to prohibit or regulate the accumulation of [[property]] and the flow of [[Capital (economics)|capital]].

===Ethics===
Anarcho-capitalists argue for a society based on the voluntary trade of [[private property]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] (in sum, all relationships not caused by threats or violence, including exchanges of money, consumer goods, land, and capital goods) in order to minimize conflict while maximizing individual liberty and prosperity. However, they also recognize [[Charity (practice)|charity]] and communal arrangements as part of the same voluntary ethic.<ref>Hess, Karl. [http://fare.tunes.org/books/Hess/dop.html The Death of Politics]. Interview in Playboy Magazine, March 1969</ref> Though anarcho-capitalists are known for asserting a right to private (individualized or joint non-public) property, some propose that non-state public or community property can also exist in an anarcho-capitalist society.<ref name="Holcombe"/> For them, what is important is that it is acquired and transferred without help or hindrance from the compulsory [[State (polity)|state]]. Anarcho-capitalist [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] believe that the only just, and/or most economically beneficial, way to acquire property is through voluntary [[trade]], gift, or labor-based [[homestead principle (ethics)|original appropriation]], rather than through aggression or fraud.<ref>[[Paul Avrich|Avrich, Paul]]. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America, Abridged Paperback Edition (1996), p. 282</ref>

Anarcho-capitalists see [[free-market]] [[capitalism]] as the basis for a free and prosperous society. [[Murray Rothbard]] said that the difference between free-market capitalism and "[[state capitalism]]" is the difference between "peaceful, voluntary exchange" and a collusive partnership between business and government that uses coercion to subvert the free market.<ref>Rothbard, Murray N., [https://www.mises.org/article.aspx?Id=1559 A Future of Peace and Capitalism]; Murray N.

Political Ideology Today. Manchester University Press 2001. p. 33</ref> They therefore reject the state, seeing it as an entity which steals property (through [[taxation]] and [[Confiscation|expropriation]]), initiates aggression, has a compulsory monopoly on the use of force, uses its coercive powers to benefit some businesses and individuals at the expense of others, creates artificial monopolies, restricts trade, and restricts personal freedoms via [[drug laws]], [[compulsory education]], [[conscription]], laws on food and morality, and the like.

Laissez-faire anarchists argue that the state is an [[non-aggression principle|initiation of force]] because force can be used against those who have not [[theft|stolen private property]], [[vandalism|vandalized private property]], [[assault|assaulted anyone]], or [[fraud|committed fraud]]. Many also argue that [[subsidy|subsidized]] [[monopoly|monopolies]] tend to be corrupt and inefficient. Anarchist theorist Rothbard argued that all government services, including defense, are inefficient because they lack a market-based [[pricing mechanism]] regulated by the voluntary decisions of [[consumer]]s purchasing services that fulfill their highest-priority needs and by investors seeking the most profitable enterprises to invest in.<ref>{{cite book

Rothbard bases his philosophy on [[natural law]] grounds and also provides economic explanations of why he thinks anarcho-capitalism is preferable on pragmatic grounds as well. [[David D. Friedman]] says he is not an [[moral absolutism|absolutist]] rights theorist but is also "not a [[utilitarian]]", however, he does believe that "utilitarian arguments are usually the best way to defend libertarian views".<ref>Friedman, David D.

Anarcho-capitalism, as formulated by Rothbard and others, holds strongly to the central libertarian ''nonaggression axiom'':

{{quote|[...] The basic axiom of libertarian political theory holds that every man is a self owner, having absolute jurisdiction over his own body. In effect, this means that no one else may justly invade, or aggress against, another's person. It follows then that each person justly owns whatever previously unowned resources he appropriates or "mixes his labor with". From these twin axioms&nbsp;<U+2013> self-ownership and "homesteading"&nbsp;<U+2013> stem the justification for the entire system of property rights titles in a free-market society. This system establishes the right of every man to his own person, the right of donation, of bequest (and, concomitantly, the right to receive the bequest or inheritance), and the right of contractual exchange of property titles.<ref>Rothbard, Murray N. (1982) [https://www.mises.org/rothbard/lawproperty.pdf "Law, Property Rights, and Air Pollution"] Cato Journal 2, No. 1 (Spring 1982): pp. 55<U+2013>99. Retrieved 20 May 2005</ref>}}

Rothbard's defense of the self-ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives, namely that either a group of people can own another group of people, or the other alternative, that no single person has full ownership over one's self. Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a [[universal ethic]], i.e., a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal.<ref name="Rothbard-1982.2">Rothbard, Murray N. (1982) [https://www.mises.org/rothbard/ethics/ethics.asp ''The Ethics of Liberty''] Humanities Press ISBN 978-0-8147-7506-6 p. 162 Retrieved 20 May 2005</ref>

In general, the nonaggression axiom can be said to be a prohibition against the initiation of force, or the threat of force, against persons (i.e., direct violence, assault, [[murder]]) or property (i.e., fraud, [[burglary]], theft, taxation).<ref>Rothbard, Murray N. (1973) [https://www.mises.org/rothbard/newliberty.asp ''For a new Liberty''] Collier Books, A Division of Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc., New York: pp. 24<U+2013>25. Retrieved 20 May 2005</ref> The initiation of force is usually referred to as [[aggression]] or [[coercion]]. The difference between anarcho-capitalists and other libertarians is largely one of the degree to which they take this axiom. [[Minarchist]] libertarians, such as most people involved in [[List of libertarian political parties|libertarian political parties]], would retain the state in some smaller and less invasive form, retaining at the very least public [[police]], [[court]]s and [[military]]; others, however, might give further allowance for other government programs. In contrast, anarcho-capitalists reject any level of state intervention, defining the state as a [[coercive monopoly]] and, as the only entity in human society that derives its income from legal aggression, an entity that inherently violates the central axiom of libertarianism.<ref name="Rothbard-1982.2"/>

Some anarcho-capitalists, such as Rothbard, accept the nonaggression axiom on an intrinsic moral or natural law basis. It is in terms of the non-aggression principle that Rothbard defined [[anarchism]]; he defined "anarchism as a system which provides no legal sanction for such aggression ['against person and property']" and said that "what anarchism proposes to do, then, is to abolish the State, i.e. to abolish the regularized institution of aggressive coercion."<ref>Rothbard, Murray N. (1975) [https://www.mises.org/journals/lf/1975/1975_01.pdf ''Society Without A State (pdf)''] ''Libertarian Forum'' newsletter (January 1975)</ref> In an interview published in the libertarian journal ''New Banner'', Rothbard said that "capitalism is the fullest expression of anarchism, and anarchism is the fullest expression of capitalism."<ref>[http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard103.html ''Exclusive Interview With Murray Rothbard''] The New Banner: A Fortnightly Libertarian Journal (25 February 1972)</ref>

===Property===

====Private property====
Central to Rothbardian anarcho-capitalism are the concepts of [[self-ownership]] and original appropriation:

{{quote|Everyone is the proper owner of his own physical body as well as of all places and nature-given goods that he occupies and puts to use by means of his body, provided only that no one else has already occupied or used the same places and goods before him. This ownership of "originally appropriated" places and goods by a person implies his right to use and transform these places and goods in any way he sees fit, provided only that he does not change thereby uninvitedly the physical integrity of places and goods originally appropriated by another person. In particular, once a place or good has been first appropriated by, in John Locke's phrase, 'mixing one's labor' with it, ownership in such places and goods can be acquired only by means of a voluntary&nbsp;<U+2013> contractual&nbsp;<U+2013> transfer of its property title from a previous to a later owner.<ref name="Hoppe-2002">Hoppe, Hans-Hermann (2002) [http://www.lewrockwell.com/hoppe/hoppe7.html "Rothbardian Ethics"] Retrieved 23 May 2005</ref>}}

Anarcho-capitalism uses the following terms in ways that may differ from common usage or various anarchist movements.
* '''Anarchism:''' any philosophy that opposes all forms of initiatory coercion (includes opposition to the State)
* '''Contract:''' a voluntary binding agreement between persons
* '''Coercion:''' physical force or threat of such against persons or property
* '''Capitalism:''' economic system where the means of production are privately owned, and where investments, production, distribution, income, and prices are determined through the operation of a free market rather than by government
* '''Free market:''' a market where all decisions regarding transfer of money, goods (including capital goods), and services are voluntary
* '''Fraud:''' inducing one to part with something of value through the use of dishonesty
* '''State:''' an organization that taxes and engages in regularized and institutionalized aggressive coercion
* '''Voluntary:''' any action not influenced by coercion or fraud perpetrated by any human agency
|}

This is the root of anarcho-capitalist [[property rights]], and where they differ from [[collectivism|collectivist]] forms of anarchism such as [[anarcho-communism]] where the means of production are controlled by the whole community and the product of labor is collectivized in a pool of goods and distributed "according to need." Anarcho-capitalists advocate individual or joint (i.e. ''private'') ownership of the means of production and the product of labor regardless of what the individual "needs" or does not need. As Rothbard says, "if every man has the right to own his own body and if he must use and transform material natural objects in order to survive, then he has the right to own the product that he has made." After property is transformed through labor it may then only exchange hands legitimately by trade or gift; forced transfers are considered illegitimate. Original appropriation allows an individual to claim any never-before used resources, including land, and by improving or otherwise using it, own it with the same "absolute right" as his own body. According to Rothbard, property can only come about through labor, therefore original appropriation of land is not legitimate by merely claiming it or building a fence around it; it is only by ''using'' land&nbsp;<U+2013> by mixing one's labor with it&nbsp;<U+2013> that original appropriation is legitimized: "Any attempt to claim a new resource that someone does not use would have to be considered invasive of the property right of whoever the first user will turn out to be." Rothbard argues that the resource need not ''continue'' to be used in order for it to be the person's property, "for once his labor is mixed with the natural resource, it remains his owned land. His labor has been irretrievably mixed with the land, and the land is therefore his or his assigns' in perpetuity."<ref name="Rothbard-1962">Rothbard, Murray N. (1962) [https://www.mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap2d.asp Ludwig von Mises Institute] ''[[Man, Economy & State]] with [[Power and Market]]'' [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] ISBN 978-0-945466-30-7 ch. 2 Retrieved 19 May 2005</ref> As a practical matter, in terms of the ownership of land, anarcho-capitalists recognize that there are few (if any) parcels of land left on Earth whose ownership was not at some point in time obtained in violation of the homestead principle, through seizure by the state or put in private hands with the assistance of the state. Rothbard says,

{{quote|It is not enough to call simply for defense of "the rights of private property"; there must be an adequate theory of justice in property rights, else any property that some State once decreed to be "private" must now be defended by libertarians, no matter how unjust the procedure or how mischievous its consequences.<ref name="autogenerated1" />}}

Rothbard says in "Justice and Property Right" that "any identifiable owner (the original victim of theft or his heir) must be accorded his property." In the case of slavery, Rothbard says that in many cases "the old plantations and the heirs and descendants of the former slaves can be identified, and the reparations can become highly specific indeed." He believes slaves rightfully own any land they were forced to work on under the "homestead principle". If property is held by the state, Rothbard advocates its confiscation and return to the private sector: "any property in the hands of the State is in the hands of thieves, and should be liberated as quickly as possible." For example, he proposes that [[State university|State universities]] be seized by the students and faculty under the homestead principle. Rothbard also supports expropriation of nominally "private property" if it is the result of state-initiated force, such as businesses who receive grants and subsidies. He proposes that businesses who receive at least 50% of their funding from the state be confiscated by the workers. He says, "What we libertarians object to, then, is not government per se but crime, what we object to is unjust or criminal property titles; what we are for is not "private" property per se but just, innocent, non-criminal private property." Likewise, Karl Hess says, "libertarianism wants to advance ''principles'' of property but that it in no way wishes to defend, willy nilly, all property which now is called private... Much of that property is stolen. Much is of dubious title. All of it is deeply intertwined with an immoral, coercive state system."<ref>Hess, Karl (1969) ''[https://mises.org/journals/lf/1969/1969_06_15.pdf Letter From Washington]'' The Libertatian Forum Vol. I, No. VI (15 June 1969) Retrieved 5 August 2006</ref> By accepting an axiomatic definition of private property and property rights, anarcho-capitalists deny the legitimacy of a state on principle:

{{quote|For, apart from ruling out as unjustified all activities such as murder, homicide, rape, trespass, robbery, burglary, theft, and fraud, the ethics of private property is also incompatible with the existence of a state defined as an agency that possesses a compulsory territorial monopoly of ultimate decision-making (jurisdiction) and/or the right to tax.<ref name="Hoppe-2002"/>}}

====Common property====
Though anarcho-capitalists assert a right to private property, some anarcho-capitalists also point out that common, i.e. community, property can exist by right in an anarcho-capitalist system. Just as an individual comes to own that which was unowned by mixing his labor with it or using it regularly, a whole community or society can come to own a thing in common by mixing their labor with it collectively, meaning that no individual may appropriate it as his own. This may apply to roads, parks, rivers, and portions of oceans.<ref name="Holcombe">Holcombe, Randall G., [https://mises.org/journals/jls/19_2/19_2_1.pdf Common Property in Anarcho-Capitalism], Journal of Libertarian Studies, Volume 19, No. 2 (Spring 2005):3<U+2013>29.</ref> Anarcho-capitalist theorist [[Roderick Long]] gives the following example:

{{quote|Consider a village near a lake. It is common for the villagers to walk down to the lake to go fishing. In the early days of the community it's hard to get to the lake because of all the bushes and fallen branches in the way. But over time the way is cleared and a path forms&nbsp;<U+2013> not through any coordinated efforts, but simply as a result of all the individuals walking by that way day after day. The cleared path is the product of labor&nbsp;<U+2013> not any individual's labor, but all of them together. If one villager decided to take advantage of the now-created path by setting up a gate and charging tolls, he would be violating the collective property right that the villagers together have earned.<ref>Long, Roderick T. 199. "A Plea for Public Property." Formulations 5, no. 3 (Spring)</ref>}}

Nevertheless, since property that is owned collectively tends to lose the level of accountability found in individual ownership to the extent of the number of owners <U+2013> and make consensus regarding property use and maintenance decisions proportionately less likely, anarcho-capitalists generally distrust and seek to avoid intentional [[communal]] arrangements. [[Privatization]], [[decentralization]], and individualization are often anarcho-capitalist goals. But in some cases, they not only provide a challenge, but are considered next to impossible. Established ocean routes, for example, are generally seen as unavailable for private appropriation.

Anarcho-capitalists tend to concur with [[Free-market environmentalism|free-market environmentalists]] regarding the environmentally destructive tendencies of the state and other communal arrangements. Air, water, and land [[pollution]], for example, are seen as the result of collectivization of ownership. Central governments generally strike down individual or [[class action]] censure of polluters in order to benefit "the many", and legal or economic [[subsidy]] of [[heavy industry]] is justified by many [[politician]]s for [[job creation]] within a political territory.<ref name="libertarianpapers" />

===Economics===
The [[Austrian school]] of economics argued against the viability of socialism and centrally planned economic policy. [[Eugen von B<U+00F6>hm-Bawerk]], a colleague of Austrian school founder [[Carl Menger]], wrote one of the first critiques of socialism in his treatise ''The Exploitation Theory of Socialism-Communism''. Later, [[Friedrich von Hayek]] wrote ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', which states that a [[command economy]] lacks the information function of market prices, and that central authority over the economy leads to [[totalitarianism]]. Another Austrian economist, [[Ludwig von Mises]], wrote ''[[Human Action]]'', an early exposition of the method he called [[Praxeology]].
[[File:Murray Rothbard.jpg|thumb|left|[[Murray Rothbard]] (1926<U+2013>95).]]
Rothbard attempted to meld Austrian economics with classical liberalism and individualist anarchism. He wrote his first paper advocating "private property anarchism" in 1949, and later came up with the alternative name ''anarcho-capitalism''. He was probably the first to use ''libertarian'' in its current (U.S.) pro-capitalist sense. His academic training was in economics, but his writings also refer to history and political philosophy. When young, he considered himself part of the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]], an anti-statist and anti-[[interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] branch of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]]. In the late 1950s, he was briefly involved with [[Ayn Rand]], but later had a falling out. When interventionist [[cold warrior]]s of the ''[[National Review]]'', such as [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]], gained influence in the Republican party in the 1950s, Rothbard quit that group and briefly associated himself with [[left-wing]] [[antiwar]] groups. He believed that the cold warriors were more indebted in theory to the left and imperialist progressives, especially with respect to [[Trotskyist]] theory.<ref name="Rothbard">Rothbard, Murray N. [http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard16.html LewRockwell.com]. Retrieved 10 September 2006.</ref> Rothbard initially opposed the founding of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] but joined in 1973 and became one of its leading activists.

===Contractual society===
[[File:Althing-stamp.jpg|thumb|right|A postage stamp celebrating the thousandth anniversary of the [[Althing|Icelandic parliament]]. According to a theory associated with the economist [[David D. Friedman|David Friedman]], [[Icelandic Commonwealth|medieval Icelandic society]] had some features of anarcho-capitalism. Chieftaincies could be bought and sold, and were not geographical monopolies; individuals could voluntarily choose membership in any chieftain's clan.]]

The society envisioned by anarcho-capitalists has been called the ''Contractual Society''&nbsp;<U+2013> "... a society based purely on voluntary action, entirely unhampered by violence or threats of violence."<ref name="Rothbard-1962"/>&nbsp;<U+2013> in which anarcho-capitalists assert the system relies on voluntary agreements ([[contract]]s) between individuals as the legal framework. It is difficult to predict precisely what the particulars of this society will look like because of the details and complexities of contracts.

One particular ramification is that transfer of property and services must be considered voluntarily on the part of both parties. No external entities can force an individual to accept or deny a particular transaction. An employer might offer [[insurance]] and [[Bereavement benefit|death benefits]] to [[same-sex marriage|same-sex couples]]; another might refuse to recognize any union outside his or her own faith. Individuals are free to enter into or reject contractual agreements as they see fit.

Rothbard points out that corporations would exist in a free society, as they are simply the pooling of capital. He says limited liability for corporations could also exist through contract: "Corporations are not at all monopolistic privileges; they are free associations of individuals pooling their capital. On the purely free market, such men would simply announce to their creditors that their liability is limited to the capital specifically invested in the corporation...."<ref name="Rothbard-1962"/>

Corporations created in this way would not, however, be able to replicate the limit on liabilities arising non-contractually, such as liability in tort for environmental disasters or personal injury, which corporations currently enjoy. Rothbard himself acknowledges that "limited liability for torts is the illegitimate conferring of a special privilege"<ref>Rothbard, Murray N. (1962) Man, Economy & State with Power and Market, [https://mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap15d.asp#_ftn11 Mises.org]</ref>

There are limits to the right to contract under some interpretations of anarcho-capitalism. Rothbard himself argues that the right to contract is based in [[inalienable rights|inalienable human rights]]<ref name="Rothbard-1982.2"/> and therefore any contract that implicitly violates those rights can be voided at will, which would, for instance, prevent a person from permanently selling himself or herself into unindentured [[slavery]]. Other interpretations conclude that banning such contracts would in itself be an unacceptably invasive interference in the right to contract.<ref name="Nozick-1973">[[Robert Nozick|Nozick, Robert]] (1973) ''Anarchy, State, and Utopia''</ref>

Included in the right of contract is the right to contract oneself out for employment by others. Unlike anarcho-communists, anarcho-capitalists support the liberty of individuals to be self-employed or to contract to be employees of others, whichever they prefer and the freedom to pay and receive wages. Some anarcho-capitalists prefer to see self-employment prevail over wage labor. For example, David Friedman has expressed preference for a society where "almost everyone is self-employed" and "instead of corporations there are large groups of entrepreneurs related by trade, not authority. Each sells not his time, but what his time produces."<ref>Friedman, David. The Machinery of Freedom: Guide to a Radical Capitalism. Harper & Row. pp. 144<U+2013>45</ref> Others, such as Rothbard, do not express a preference either way but justify employment as a natural occurrence in a free market that is not immoral in any way.

===Law and order and the use of violence===
Different anarcho-capitalists propose different forms of anarcho-capitalism, and one area of disagreement is in the area of law. Morris and Linda Tannehill, in ''[[The Market for Liberty]]'', object to any [[statute|statutory]] law whatsoever. They argue that all one has to do is ask if one is aggressing against another (see [[tort]] and contract law) in order to decide if an act is right or wrong.<ref>Brown, Susan Love, ''The Free Market as Salvation from Government: The Anarcho-Capitalist View'', Meanings of the Market: The Free Market in Western Culture, edited by James G. Carrier, Berg/Oxford, 1997, p. 113.</ref> However, Rothbard, while also supporting a natural prohibition on force and fraud, supports the establishment of a mutually agreed-upon centralized [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] legal code which private courts would pledge to follow.

Unlike both the Tannehills and Rothbard who see an [[ideological]] commonality of [[ethics]] and [[morality]] as a requirement, David Friedman proposes that "the systems of law will be produced for profit on the open market, just as books and bras are produced today. There could be competition among different brands of law, just as there is competition among different brands of cars."<ref name = "koltwm">Friedman, David. ''The Machinery of Freedom''. Second edition. La Salle, Ill, Open Court, pp. 116<U+2013>17.</ref> Friedman says whether this would lead to a libertarian society "remains to be proven." He says it is a possibility that very unlibertarian laws may result, such as laws against drugs. But, he thinks this would be rare. He reasons that "if the value of a law to its supporters is less than its cost to its victims, that law...will not survive in an anarcho-capitalist society."<ref>Friedman, David. The Machinery of Freedom: Guide to a Radical Capitalism. Harper & Row. pp. 127<U+2013>28</ref>

Anarcho-capitalists only accept collective defense of individual liberty (i.e., courts, military or police forces) insofar as such groups are formed and paid for on an explicitly voluntary basis. But, their complaint is not just that the state's defensive services are funded by taxation but that the state assumes it is the only legitimate practitioner of physical force. That is, it forcibly prevents the private sector from providing comprehensive security, such as a police, judicial, and prison systems to protect individuals from aggressors. Anarcho-capitalists believe that there is nothing morally superior about the state which would grant it, but not private individuals, a right to use physical force to restrain aggressors. Also, if competition in security provision were allowed to exist, prices would be lower and services would be better according to anarcho-capitalists. According to Molinari, "Under a regime of liberty, the natural organization of the security industry would not be different from that of other industries."<ref name="Molinari-1849">Molinari, Gustave de (1849) [http://praxeology.net/GM-PS.htm The Production of Security] ''(trans.

[[Subrogation]], which allows remuneration for losses and damages to be funded by the aggressors, reduces insurance costs and could operate as a business in itself <U+2013> converting victims from paying customers into direct beneficiaries. The concept of [[Restitution Transfer and Recoupment]] (RTR) has been explored by freenation theorist John Frederic Kosanke.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.seasteading.org/index.php/Restitution_Transfer_and_Recoupment |title=Restitution_Transfer_and_Recoupment}}</ref> RTR agencies would employ [[performance bond|bonding]] agencies, [[private investigators]], private dispute resolution organizations, and private aggressor containment agencies, as required. Instead of having to pay for restitution, victims sell restitution rights to the RTR agencies. This arrangement can be compared to the contractual nature of the Go<U+00F0>or<U+00F0> system employed in the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]] by competing chieftains.

[[File:The death of general warren at the battle of bunker hill.jpg|thumb|right|[[Murray Rothbard]] admired the [[American Revolutionary War]] and believed it is the only U.S. war that can be justified.]]

Like [[classical liberalism]], and unlike [[anarcho-pacifism]], anarcho-capitalism permits the use of force, as long as it is in the defense of persons or property. The permissible extent of this defensive use of force is an arguable point among anarcho-capitalists. [[Retributive justice]], meaning retaliatory force, is often a component of the contracts imagined for an anarcho-capitalist society. Some believe [[prison]]s or [[indentured servitude]] would be justifiable institutions to deal with those who violate anarcho-capitalist property relations, while others believe [[exile]] or forced [[restitution]] are sufficient.<ref>O'Keeffe, Matthew (1989) [http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/legan/legan005.pdf "Retribution versus Restitution"] Legal Notes No. 5, Libertarian Alliance ISBN 978-1-870614-22-1 Retrieved 19 May 2005</ref>

[[Bruce L. Benson]] argues that legal codes may impose punitive damages for intentional torts in the interest of deterring crime. For instance, a thief who breaks into a house by picking a lock and is caught before taking anything would still owe the victim for violating the sanctity of his property rights. Benson opines that, despite the lack of objectively measurable losses in such cases, "standardized rules that are generally perceived to be fair by members of the community would, in all likelihood, be established through precedent, allowing judgments to specify payments that are reasonably appropriate for most criminal offenses."<ref>{{cite book|last=Benson|first=Bruce|title=To Serve and Protect: Privatization and Community in Criminal Justice|publisher=[[New York University Press|NYU Press]]|year=1998|pages=235<U+2013>238|isbn=978-0-8147-1327-3}}</ref> The Tannehills raise a similar example, noting that a bank robber who had an attack of conscience and returned the money would still owe reparations for endangering the employees' and customers' lives and safety, in addition to the costs of the defense agency answering the teller's call for help. But the robber's loss of reputation would be even more damaging. Specialized companies would list aggressors so that anyone wishing to do business with a man could first check his record. The bank robber would find insurance companies listing him as a very poor risk, and other firms would be reluctant to enter into contracts with him.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Market for Liberty|url=https://www.mises.org/books/marketforliberty.pdf|pages=105<U+2013>106|isbn=978-0-930073-08-4|author=Tannehill, Linda and Morris|year=1993|publisher=Fox & Wilkes|location=San Francisco|accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref>

One difficult application of defensive aggression is the act of revolutionary violence (including [[anarcho-capitalist revolution]]) against tyrannical regimes. Many anarcho-capitalists admire the [[American Revolution]] as the legitimate act of individuals working together to fight against [[tyranny|tyrannical]] restrictions of their liberties. In fact, according to Rothbard, the American Revolutionary War was the only war involving the United States that could be justified.<ref>Rothbard, Murray N. (1973) [http://www.antiwar.com/orig/rothbard_on_war.html Interview] ''Reason'' February 1973. Retrieved 10 August 2005.</ref> Some anarcho-capitalists, such as [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]], feel that violent revolution is counter-productive and prefer voluntary forms of [[economic secession]] to the extent possible.

==Branches of anarcho-capitalism==
The two principal moral approaches to anarcho-capitalism differ in regard to whether anarcho-capitalist society is justified on [[deontological]] or [[consequentialist]] ethics, or both. Natural-law anarcho-capitalism (as advocated by Rothbard) holds that a universal system of rights can be derived from natural law. Some other anarcho-capitalists do not rely upon the idea of natural rights, but instead present economic justifications for a free-market capitalist society. Such a latter approach has been offered by David D. Friedman in ''[[The Machinery of Freedom]]''.<ref name="Tame, Chris R 1983. p. 56">Tame, Chris R. October 1983. The Chicago School: Lessons from the Thirties for the Eighties. Economic Affairs. p. 56</ref> Also unlike other anarcho-capitalists, most notably Rothbard, Friedman has never tried to deny the theoretical cogency of the neoclassical literature on "[[market failure]]", but openly applies the theory to both market and government institutions (see [[Government failure|"government failure"]]) to compare the net result. Nor has he been inclined to attack economic efficiency as a [[Normative economics|normative]] benchmark.<ref name="Friedman-1973"/>

Kosanke sees such a debate as irrelevant since, in the absence of statutory law, the [[non-aggression principle]] (NAP) is naturally enforced, because individuals are automatically held accountable for their actions via tort and contract law. Communities of sovereign individuals naturally expel aggressors in the same way that ethical business practices are naturally required among competing businesses that are subject to the discipline of the marketplace. For him, the only thing that needs to be debated is the nature of the contractual mechanism that abolishes the state, or prevents it from coming into existence where new communities form.<ref name="libertarianpapers" />

==Anarcho-capitalism and other anarchist schools==

It has therefore now become necessary to distinguish between their right libertarianism and the left libertarianism of the anarchist tradition."</ref> In particular, they argue that capitalist transactions are not voluntary, and that maintaining the class structure of a capitalist society requires coercion, which is incompatible with an anarchist society.<ref name="Tame, Chris R 1983. p. 56"/>

Murray Rothbard argues that the capitalist system of today is, indeed, not properly anarchistic because it so often colludes with the state. According to Rothbard, "what Marx and later writers have done is to lump together two extremely different and even contradictory concepts and actions under the same portmanteau term. These two contradictory concepts are what I would call 'free-market capitalism' on the one hand, and 'state capitalism' on the other."<ref name="fpc">Rothbard, Murray N (1973). "[https://www.mises.org/article.aspx?Id=1559 A Future of Peace and Capitalism]". James H. Weaver, ed., ''Modern Political Economy''. Boston: Allyn and Bacon. pp. 419<U+2013>30.</ref> "The difference between free-market capitalism and state capitalism," writes Rothbard, "is precisely the difference between, on the one hand, peaceful, voluntary exchange, and on the other, violent expropriation." He continues, "State capitalism inevitably creates all sorts of problems which become insoluble."<ref name="fpc"/>

Rothbard maintains that anarcho-capitalism is the only true form of anarchism<U+2014>the only form of anarchism that could possibly exist in reality, as, he argues, any other form presupposes an authoritarian enforcement of political ideology, such as redistribution of private property.<ref>Rothbard, Murray N (25 February 1972). [http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard103.html Exclusive Interview With Murray Rothbard]. ''The New Banner: A Fortnightly Libertarian Journal''.</ref> According to this argument, the free market is simply the natural situation that would result from people being free from authority, and entails the establishment of all voluntary associations in society: cooperatives, non-profit organizations, businesses, etc. Moreover, anarcho-capitalists, as well as classical liberal minarchists, argue that the application of left-wing anarchist ideals would require an authoritarian body of some sort to impose it. In order to forcefully prevent people from accumulating private capital, there would necessarily be a redistributive organization of some sort which would have the authority to, in essence, exact a tax and re-allocate the resulting resources to a larger group of people. This body would thus inherently have political power and would be nothing short of a state. The difference between such an arrangement and an anarcho-capitalist system is precisely the voluntary nature of organization within anarcho-capitalism contrasted with a centralized ideology and a paired enforcement mechanism which would be necessary under a coercively egalitarian-anarchist system.<ref name="Tame, Chris R 1983. p. 56"/>

However, Rothbard also wrote a piece, published posthumously, entitled 'Are Libertarians "Anarchists"?' where he traced the etymological roots of Anarchist philosophy, ultimately coming to the conclusion that "...we find that all of the current anarchists are irrational collectivists, and therefore at opposite poles from our position. That none of the proclaimed anarchist groups correspond to the libertarian position, that even the best of them have unrealistic and socialistic elements in their doctrines", and furthermore, "We must therefore conclude that we are not anarchists, and that those who call us anarchists are not on firm etymological ground, and are being completely unhistorical. On the other hand, it is clear that we are not archists either: we do not believe in establishing a tyrannical central authority that will coerce the noninvasive as well as the invasive. Perhaps, then, we could call ourselves by a new name: nonarchist. "<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mises.org/daily/2801|title=Mises Daily|work=Mises Institute}}</ref>

==History==

===Classical liberalism===
{{Main|Classical liberalism}}

Classical liberalism is the primary influence with the longest history on anarcho-capitalist theory. Classical liberals have had two main themes since [[John Locke]] first expounded the philosophy: the liberty of man, and limitations of state power. The liberty of man was expressed in terms of [[natural rights]], while limiting the state was based (for Locke) on a [[consent theory]].

In the 19th century, classical liberals led the attack against statism. One notable was [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Bastiat]] (''[[The Law (1849 book)|The Law]]''), who wrote, "The state is the great fiction by which everybody seeks to live at the expense of everybody else." [[Henry David Thoreau]] wrote, "I heartily accept the motto, 'That government is best which governs least'; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe, 'That government is best which governs not at all'; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have."<ref>Thoreau, Henry David (1849) [http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/Literature/Thoreau/CivilDisobedience.html Civil Disobedience]</ref>

The early liberals believed that the state should confine its role to protecting individual liberty and property, and opposed all but the most minimal economic regulations. The "normative core" of classical liberalism is the idea that in an environment of [[laissez-faire]], a [[spontaneous order]] of cooperation in exchanging goods and services emerges that satisfies human wants.<ref>Razeen, Sally. ''Classical Liberalism and International Economic Order: Studies in Theory and Intellectual History'', Routledge (UK) ISBN 978-0-415-16493-1, 1998, p. 17</ref> Some individualists came to realize that the liberal state itself takes property forcefully through taxation in order to fund its protection services, and therefore it seemed logically inconsistent to oppose theft while also supporting a tax-funded protector. So, they advocated what may be seen as classical liberalism taken to the extreme by only supporting voluntarily funded defense by competing private providers. One of the first liberals to discuss the possibility of privatizing protection of individual liberty and property was France's [[Jakob Mauvillon]] in the 18th century. Later, in the 1840s, [[Julius Faucher]] and [[Gustave de Molinari]] advocated the same.

Molinari, in his essay ''The Production of Security'', argued, "No government should have the right to prevent another government from going into competition with it, or to require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this commodity." Molinari and this new type of anti-state liberal grounded their reasoning on liberal ideals and classical economics. Historian and libertarian [[Ralph Raico]] argues that what these liberal philosophers "had come up with was a form of individualist anarchism, or, as it would be called today, anarcho-capitalism or market anarchism."<ref>Raico, Ralph (2004) [https://www.mises.org/story/1787 ''Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th century''] Ecole Polytechnique, [http://www.crea.polytechnique.fr/index.htm Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee], Unit<U+00E9> associ<U+00E9>e au CNRS</ref> Unlike the liberalism of Locke, which saw the state as evolving from society, the anti-state liberals saw a fundamental conflict between the voluntary interactions of people&nbsp;<U+2013> society&nbsp;<U+2013> and the institutions of force&nbsp;<U+2013> the State. This ''society versus state'' idea was expressed in various ways: natural society vs. artificial society, liberty vs. authority, society of contract vs. society of authority, and industrial society vs. militant society, just to name a few.<ref name="Molinari-1849"/> The anti-state liberal tradition in Europe and the United States continued after Molinari in the early writings of [[Herbert Spencer]], as well as in thinkers such as [[Paul <U+00C9>mile de Puydt]] and [[Auberon Herbert]].

Later, in the early 20th century, the mantle of anti-state liberalism was taken by the Old Right. These were minarchists, anti-war, anti-imperialists, and (later) anti-[[New Deal]]ers. Some of the most notable members of the Old Right were [[Albert Jay Nock]], [[Rose Wilder Lane]], [[Isabel Paterson]], [[Frank Chodorov]], [[Garet Garrett]], and [[H. L. Mencken]]. In the 1950s, the new "fusion conservatism", also called "[[cold war]] conservatism", took hold of the right wing in the U.S., stressing anti-communism. This induced the libertarian Old Right to split off from the right, and seek alliances with the (now left-wing) antiwar movement, and to start specifically libertarian organizations such as the (U.S.) Libertarian Party.

However, he thought they had a faulty understanding of economics.

So, Rothbard sought to meld 19th-century American individualists' advocacy of free markets and private defense with the principles of Austrian economics: "There is, in the body of thought known as 'Austrian economics', a scientific explanation of the workings of the free market (and of the consequences of government intervention in that market) which individualist anarchists could easily incorporate into their political and social Weltanschauung".<ref name=autogenerated3>"[https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/20_1/20_1_2.pdf The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist's View], Journal of Libertarian Studies, vol. 20, no. 1, p. 7 (1965, 2000)</ref> Rothbard held that the economic consequences of the political system they advocate would not result in an economy with people being paid in proportion to labor amounts, nor would profit and interest disappear as they expected. Tucker thought that unregulated banking and money issuance would cause increases in the money supply so that interest rates would drop to zero or near to it.

Rothbard disagreed with this, as he explains in ''The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist's View''. He says that first of all Tucker was wrong to think that that would cause the money supply to increase, because he says that the money supply in a free market would be self-regulating. If it were not, then inflation would occur, so it is not necessarily desirable to increase the money supply in the first place. Secondly, he says that Tucker is wrong to think that interest would disappear regardless, because people in general do not wish to lend their money to others without compensation so there is no reason why this would change just because banking was unregulated. Also, Tucker held a labor theory of value. As a result, he thought that in a free market that people would be paid in proportion to how much labor they exerted and that if they were not then exploitation or "usury" was taking place. As he explains in ''State Socialism and Anarchism'', his theory was that unregulated banking would cause more money to be available and that this would allow proliferation of new businesses, which would in turn raise demand for labor. This led him to believe that the labor theory of value would be vindicated, and equal amounts of labor would receive equal pay. Again, as a neoclassical economist, Rothbard did not agree with the labor theory. He believed that prices of goods and services are proportional to [[marginal utility]] rather than to labor amounts in free market. And he did not think that there was anything exploitative about people receiving an income according to how much buyers of their services value their labor or what that labor produces.

[[Benjamin Tucker]] opposed vast concentrations of [[wealth]], which he believed were made possible by government intervention and state protected monopolies. He believed the most dangerous state intervention was the requirement that individuals obtain charters in order to operate banks and what he believed to be the illegality of issuing private money, which he believed caused capital to concentrate in the hands of a privileged few which he called the "banking monopoly." He believed anyone should be able to engage in banking that wished, without requiring state permission, and issue private money. Though he was supporter of laissez-faire, late in life he said that State intervention had allowed some extreme concentrations of resources to such a degree that even if laissez-faire were instituted, it would be too late for competition to be able to release those resources (he gave Standard Oil as an example).<ref>Tucker, Benjamin. [http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker2.html State Socialism and Anarchism]</ref> Anarcho-capitalists also oppose governmental restrictions on banking. They, like all [[Austrian School|Austrian]] economists, believe that monopolization is facilitated and expanded through government intervention. 19th-century American individualist anarchists such as Tucker and Lysander Spooner have long argued that monopoly on credit and land interferes with the functioning of a free market economy.

Of particular importance to anarcho-capitalists and Tucker and Spooner are the ideas of "sovereignty of the individual", a market economy, and the opposition to collectivism. A defining point upon which they agree is that defense of liberty and property should be provided in the free market rather than by the State. Tucker said, "[D]efense is a service like any other service; that it is labor both useful and desired, and therefore an economic commodity subject to the law of supply and demand; that in a free market this commodity would be furnished at the cost of production; that, competition prevailing, patronage would go to those who furnished the best article at the lowest price; that the production and sale of this commodity are now monopolized by the State; and that the State, like almost all monopolists, charges exorbitant prices."<ref>Tucker, Benjamin. "Instead of a Book" (1893)</ref>

<!-- Other examples, such as Celtic Ireland and early colonies in the U.S., provied by [http://www.ozarkia.net/bill/anarchism/faq.html this source] may be included as well. -->
===Medieval Iceland===
{{one source|section|date=October 2014}}
[[File:Law speaker.jpg|right|thumb|19th century interpretation of the [[Althing]] in the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]], which authors such as [[David D. Friedman|David Friedman]] and [[Roderick Long]] believe to have some features of anarcho-capitalist society.]]
According to the [[libertarianism|libertarian]] theorist [[David D. Friedman]], "Medieval Icelandic institutions have several peculiar and interesting characteristics; they might almost have been invented by a mad economist to test the lengths to which market systems could supplant government in its most fundamental functions."<ref name="Friedman-79">Friedman, David D. (1979) [http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Iceland/Iceland.html Private Creation and Enforcement of Law: A Historical Case]. Retrieved 12 August 2005.</ref> While not directly labeling it anarcho-capitalist, he argues that the Icelandic Commonwealth between 930 and 1262 had "some features" of an anarcho-capitalist society&nbsp;<U+2013> while there was a single legal system, enforcement of law was entirely private and highly capitalist; and so provides some evidence of how such a society would function. "Even where the Icelandic legal system recognized an essentially "public" offense, it dealt with it by giving some individual (in some cases chosen by lot from those affected) the right to pursue the case and collect the resulting fine, thus fitting it into an essentially private system."<ref name="Friedman-79"/>

===American Old West===
According to the research of [[Terry L. Anderson]] and P. J. Hill, the [[Old West]] in the United States in the period of 1830 to 1900 was similar to anarcho-capitalism in that "private agencies provided the necessary basis for an orderly society in which property was protected and conflicts were resolved," and that the common popular perception that the Old West was chaotic with little respect for property rights is incorrect.<ref>Anderson, Terry L. and Hill, P. J. [http://invisiblemolotov.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/wild-west3.pdf An American Experiment in Anarcho-Capitalism: The Not So Wild, Wild West], The Journal of Libertarian Studies</ref> Since [[squatter]]s had no claim to western lands under federal law, extra-legal organizations formed to fill the void. Benson explains:<ref>{{cite book|title=To Serve and Protect: Privatization and Community in Criminal Justice|page=101|chapter=Private Justice in America|isbn=978-0-8147-1327-3|author=Benson, Bruce L.|year=1998|publisher=[[New York University Press]]|location=New York}}</ref>
{{quote|The land clubs and claim associations each adopted their own written contract setting out the laws that provided the means for defining and protecting property rights in the land. They established procedures for registration of land claims, as well as for protection of those claims against outsiders, and for adjudication of internal disputes that arose. The reciprocal arrangements for protection would be maintained only if a member complied with the association's rules and its court's rulings. Anyone who refused would be ostracized. Boycott by a land club meant that an individual had no protection against aggression other than what he could provide himself.}}
According to Anderson, "Defining anarcho-capitalist to mean minimal government with property rights developed from the bottom up, the western frontier was anarcho-capitalistic. People on the frontier invented institutions that fit the resource constraints they faced."<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/grilling_terry_l_anderson_free_market_environmentalist/C39/L39/|title=Grilling Terry L.

* [[Robert Paul Wolff]], ''[[In Defense of Anarchism]]'', influential defence of [[analytical anarchism|anarchism]] within contemporary [[analytical philosophy]]. Wolff is not an anarcho-capitalist and has expressly repudiated this interpretation of his work. He instead favors social anarchism and an antiauthoritarian Marxist critique of capitalism; however, his book is often cited by anarcho-capitalists.

===Fiction===
Anarcho-capitalism has been examined in certain works of literature, particularly [[science fiction]]. An early example is [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s 1966 novel ''[[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress]]'', in which he explores what he terms "rational anarchism". A contemporary anarcho-capitalistic work of science fiction is [[John C. Wright (author)|John C. Wright]]'s ''[[The Golden Age (John C. Wright novel)|The Golden Age]]''.

In ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' by [[Robert Anton Wilson]] the [[Discordian Society]] headed by the character [[Hagbard Celine]] is anarcho-capitalist. The manifesto of the society in the novel 'Never Whistle While You're Pissing' contains [[Celine's Laws]], three laws regarding government and social interaction.

[[Cyberpunk]] and [[postcyberpunk]] authors have been particularly fascinated by the idea of the breakdown of the nation-state. Several stories of [[Vernor Vinge]], including ''[[Marooned in Realtime]]'' and ''[[The Collected Stories of Vernor Vinge#Conquest by Default|Conquest by Default]]'', feature anarcho-capitalist societies, sometimes portrayed in a favorable light, and sometimes not.<ref>{{cite web|last=Henry|first=Jim|title=Reviews by Jim Henry: Vernor Vinge|url=http://jimhenry.conlang.org/review/vinge_v.htm|accessdate=Mar 17, 2011}}</ref> [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[Snow Crash]]'' and ''[[The Diamond Age]]'', [[Max Barry]]'s ''[[Jennifer Government]]'' and [[L. Neil Smith]]'s ''[[The Probability Broach]]'' all explore anarcho-capitalist ideas. The cyberpunk portrayal of anarchy varies from the downright grim to the cheerfully optimistic, and it need not imply anything specific about the writer's political views. Neal Stephenson, in particular, refrains from sweeping political statements when deliberately provoked.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/36481.html |title=Neal Stephenson's Past, Present, and Future; The author of the widely praised Baroque Cycle on science, markets, and post-9/11 America |accessdate=11 August 2007 |last=Godwin |first=Mike |authorlink=Mike Godwin |author2=[[Neal Stephenson]] |date=February 2005 |format=print article |work= |publisher=Reason (magazine) | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070810173200/http://www.reason.com/news/show/36481.html| archivedate= 10 August 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/20/1518217 |title=Neal Stephenson Responds With Wit and Humor |accessdate=11 August 2007 |author=Roblimo |authorlink= |author2=Neal Stephenson |date=20 October 2004 |format=email exchange |work= |publisher=Slashdot }}</ref>

[[Ken MacLeod]]'s Fall Revolution series explores the future consequences of the breakdown of current political systems within a revolutionary context. The second novel of the series ''[[The Stone Canal]]'' deals specifically with an anarcho-capitalist society and explores issues of self-ownership, privatization of police and courts of law, and the consequences of a contractual society.

In Matt Stone's (Richard D. Fuerle) novelette ''On the Steppes of Central Asia''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anarchism.net/steppes.htm |title=On the Steppes of Central Asia |accessdate=10 February 2008 }}</ref> an American grad student is invited to work for a newspaper in Mongolia, and discovers that the Mongolian society is indeed stateless in a semi-anarcho-capitalist way. The novelette was originally written to advertise Fuerle's 1986 economics treatise ''The Pure Logic of Choice''.

[[J. Neil Schulman]]'s novel ''[[Alongside Night]]'' involves the occurrence of the achievement of a market anarchist society through [[agorism]].

''Sharper Security: A Sovereign Security Company Novel'', part of a series by Thomas Sewell, is "set a couple of decades into the near-future with a liberty view of society based on individual choice and free market economics"<ref>{{cite web|title=Sharper Security Series|url=http://catallaxymedia.com/SharperSecurity|publisher=Catallaxy Media|accessdate=23 November 2012}}</ref> and features a society where individuals hire a security company to protect and insure them from crime. The security companies are sovereign, but customers are free to switch between them. They behave as a combination of insurance/underwriting and para-military police forces. Anarcho-capitalist themes abound, including an exploration of not honoring sovereign immunity, privately owned road systems, a laissez faire market and competing currencies.

[[Sandy Sandfort]]'s, [[Scott Bieser]]'s and [[Lee Oaks]]'s Webcomic ''[[Escape from Terra]]'', examines a market anarchy based on Ceres
and its interaction with the aggressive statist society on Terra.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.escapefromterra.com/ |title=Big Head Press <U+2013> Thoughtful Stories, Graphic Novels Online And In Print <U+2013> Escape From Terra <U+2013> by Sandy Sandfort, Scott Bieser, Leila Del Duca and Lee Oaks! |publisher=Escape From Terra |date= |accessdate=22 April 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110515145012/http://www.escapefromterra.com/| archivedate= 15 May 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
