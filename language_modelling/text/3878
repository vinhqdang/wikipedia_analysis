'''De Benneville "Bert" Bell''' (February 25, 1895 <U+2013> October 11, 1959) was the [[National Football League]] (NFL) commissioner from 1945 until his death in 1959. As commissioner, he introduced competitive parity into the NFL to ameliorate the league's commercial viability and enhance its popularity, and he assisted in making the NFL the most financially sound sport's enterprise, and the dominant sports attraction, in the [[United States]] (US). He was posthumously enshrined into the charter class of the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].

Bell played football at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and as [[quarterback]] for the [[Penn Quakers football|Quakers]], he led his team to an appearance in the [[1917 Rose Bowl]]. He was drafted into the US [[United States Army|Army]] during [[World War I]] before ending his collegiate days at Penn and becoming an assistant football coach with the Quakers in the 1920s. During the [[Great Depression]], he was an assistant coach for the [[Temple Owls football|Temple Owls]] and a co-founder and co-owner of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].

With the Eagles, Bell convinced the other NFL owners to establish the [[National Football League Draft]] in order to afford the weakest teams the first opportunity to sign the best available players. He subsequently became the sole proprietor of the Eagles, but the franchise suffered financially. Eventually, he sold the Eagles and bought a stake in the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. During [[World War II]], Bell auspiciously argued against the league suspending operations until the war's conclusion.

After the war, he was elected NFL commissioner and sold his ownership in the Steelers. As commissioner, he implemented a proactive anti-gambling agenda, negotiated a merger with the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC), and unilaterally crafted the entire league schedule with an emphasis on augmenting the dramatic effect of late season matches. During the [[Golden Age of Television]], he tailored the game's rules to strengthen its appeal to mass media, and enforced a blackout policy of locally televised home contests to safeguard ticket receipts. Amidst criticism from franchise owners and under pressure from [[United States Congress|Congress]], he unilaterally recognized the [[National Football League Players Association|NFLPA]] and facilitated in the composing of the first pension plan for the players. His life would abide to oversee the [[1958 NFL Championship Game|"Greatest Game Ever Played"]] and to envision what the league would become in the future.

[[File:1916 Penn Quakers backfield.jpg|thumb|right|Bell (left) with Penn teammates Ben Derr (center) and [[Joe Berry (second baseman)|Joe Berry]] in 1916.]]
Bell entered Penn in the fall of 1914 as an English major and joined [[Phi Kappa Sigma]].<ref name="LY5-7">Lyons: 5<U+2013>7</ref><ref>Rothe: 34</ref> In a rare occurrence for a sophomore, he became the starting quarterback for Penn's coach [[George H.

Prior to Penn's 1916 season, his mother died while he was en route to her bedside.<ref name="LY7-8">Lyons:7-8</ref> Nevertheless, he started the first game for the Quakers under new coach [[Bob Folwell]], but mixed results left him platooned for the rest of the season.<ref name="LY7-8"/> Penn finished with a record of 7<U+2013>2<U+2013>1.<ref name="MAC 1080"/> However, the Quakers secured an invitation to the [[1917 Rose Bowl]] against the [[Oregon Ducks]].<ref>King: 21; cf. Lyons: 9</ref> Although the best offensive gain for Penn during their 20-14 loss to Oregon was a 20 yard run by Bell, he was replaced late in the game at quarterback after throwing an interception.<ref>Lyons: 10</ref>

In the 1917 season, Bell led Penn to a 9<U+2013>2<U+2013>0 finish,<ref name="MAC 1080"/> and afterwards, he registered with a Mobile Hospital Unit of the US Army for [[World War I]] and was deployed to [[France]] in May 1918.<ref name="LY1115">Lyons: 11<U+2013>15</ref> As a result of his unit participating in hazardous duty, it received a congratulatory letter for bravery from [[General officer|General]] [[John J.

===Early career (1920<U+2013>1932)===
Bell assembled the [[Stanley Professionals]] in Chicago in 1920, but he disbanded it prior to playing any games because of negative publicity received by Chicago due the [[Black Sox Scandal]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Widespread Baseball Probe Harmful for Pro Grid Sport; Bell Disbands Local Eleven | date = 1920-10-05 | url = http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045211/1920-10-05/ed-1/seq-18/;words=Bert+BERT+BELL+Bell?date1=1920&rows=20&searchType=basic&state=&date2=1922&proxtext=bert+bell&y=0&x=0&dateFilterType=yearRange&index=2 | work = Evening Public Ledger | page = 18}}; cf.

Lyons: 23, 29</ref> In 1928, Bell tendered his resignation at Penn in protest over the emphasis of in-season scrimmages during practices by [[Lud Wray]], a fellow assistant coach.<ref name="LY2527">Lyons: 25<U+2013>27</ref> Bell's resignation was accommodated prior to the start of the 1929 season.<ref name="LY2527"/>

Bell was then an employee of the [[Ritz-Carlton]] in Philadelphia. At one ponit, he tried his hand as a stock broker and lost $50,000 (presently, ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000|1929|r=0}}}}) during the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].<ref name="LY3032">Lyons: 30-32</ref> His father bailed him out of his deprivation, and he returned to working at the Ritz.<ref name="LY3032"/> From 1930 until 1932, he was a backfield coach for the [[Temple Owls football]] team.<ref>{{cite news | title = Bell Signed by Temple | date = 1929-12-04 | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10D1FFD3C5F177A93C6A91789D95F4D8285F9&scp=2&sq=bert+bell&st=p | work = [[The New York Times]] | pages = 42 }}; cf.

==NFL career==

===Philadelphia Eagles (1933<U+2013>1940)===
By early 1933, Bell's opinion on the NFL had changed, and he wanted to become an owner of a team based in Philadelphia.<ref name = "RPW56-95">Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 56, 95.</ref> However, college football games were provisioned for Saturdays, attracted a far greater attendance than NFL games,<ref name = "RPW56-95"/> and the [[Blue law|Pennsylvania Blue Laws]] prohibited the patronizing of professional football on Sundays.<ref name="WWARPW">Westcott: 101; cf.

MacCambridge 2005: 42</ref>
 
After the inaugural [[1933 Philadelphia Eagles season]],<ref>Willis: 310<U+2013>311; cf. Coenen: 237, Didinger with Lyons: 255</ref> Bell married Upton at St. Madeleine Sophie Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia.<ref>Lyons: 33<U+2013>38, 41.</ref> Days later, his suggestion to bestow the winner of the NFL championship game with the [[Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy]] was affirmed.<ref>Willis: 327<U+2013>328</ref> In [[1934 NFL season|1934]], the Eagles finished with a 4<U+2013>7 record,<ref>Didinger with Lyons: 255</ref> The Eagles' inability to seriously challenge other teams made it difficult to sell tickets,<ref>Lyons: 54</ref> and his failure to sign a talented college prospect<ref>Lyons: 56; cf. MacCambridge 2005: 43</ref> led him to adduce that the only way to bring stability to the league was to institute a draft to ensure the weakest teams had an advantage in signing the preeminent players.<ref>Peterson: 119; cf. Williams: 41</ref> In 1935, his proposal for a draft was accepted,<ref>Willis: 341<U+2013>343; cf. Lyons: 57<U+2013>58, DeVito: 84, Didinger with Lyons: 256</ref> and in February 1936, the [[1936 NFL Draft|first draft]] kicked off, at which he acted as [[Master of Ceremonies]].<ref>Williams: 41<U+2013>42; cf. Peterson: 119</ref> Later that month, his first child, Bert Jr., was born.<ref>Lyons: 60</ref>

In the Eagles' first three years, the partners exhausted $85,000 (presently, ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|85000|1936|r=0}}}}),<ref>MacCambridge 2005: 43; cf. Lyons: 63</ref> and at a public auction, Bell became sole owner of the Eagles with a bid of $4,500 (presently, ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4500|1936|r=0}}}}).<ref>MacCambridge 2005: 43; cf. Claassen: 335, Lyons: 63</ref> Austerity measures forced him to supplant Wray as head coach of the Eagles,<ref>Lyons: 63; cf. Claassen: 342</ref> wherein Bell led the Eagles to an 1<U+2013>11 finish, their worst record ever (as of the {{currentyear}} season).<ref>;Didinger with Lyons: 256</ref> In December, an application for a franchise in Los Angeles was obstructed by Bell and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] owner Rooney as they deemed it too far of a distance to travel for games.<ref>Willis: 355</ref>

During the Eagles' 2-8-1 [[1937 NFL season|1937 season]],<ref>Didinger with Lyons: 257</ref> his second child, [[Upton Bell|John "Upton"]], was born.<ref>Lyons: 70</ref> In the Eagles' first profitable season, [[1938 NFL season|1938]], they posted a 5<U+2013>6 record.<ref>Lyons: 72<U+2013>73.</ref> The Eagles finished 1<U+2013>9<U+2013>1 in [[1939 NFL season|1939]] and 1<U+2013>10 in [[1940 NFL season|1940]].<ref>Didinger with Lyons: 258</ref>

===Pittsburgh Steelers (1940<U+2013>1945)===
In December 1940, Bell conciliated the sale of Rooney's Steelers to [[Alexis Thompson (American football owner)|Alexis Thompson]],<ref name="Algeo: 16">Algeo: 16</ref> and then Rooney acquired half of Bell's interest in the Eagles.<ref>Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 183<U+2013>184; cf. Herskowitz: 149, Lyons: 81<U+2013>82</ref> In a series of events known as the ''Pennsylvania Polka'',<ref name="Algeo: 16"/> Rooney and Bell exchanged their entire Eagles roster and their ''territorial rights'' in Philadelphia to Thompson for his entire Steelers roster and his rights in Pittsburgh.<ref>Lyons: 87; Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 187</ref> Ostensibly, Rooney had provided assistance to Bell by rewarding him with a 20% commission on the sale of the Steelers.<ref>Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 303; cf. MacCambridge 2005: 45</ref> Bell became the Steelers head coach and Rooney became the general manager.<ref>Ruck; with Patterson and Weber: 187; cf. Lyons: 88, MacCambridge 2005: 45</ref>

During the training camp of the Pittsburgh's inaugural season with the nickname Steelers, Bell was buoyant with optimism about the team's prospect, but he became crestfallen after Rooney denigrated the squad and flippantly remarked that they looked like the "[s]ame old Steelers" (SOS).<ref>{{cite news|title=Rooney and Bell Views Differ After Early Look at Steelers|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kHcbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=b0wEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5658%2C3817409|date=August 10, 1941}}; cf. Claassen: 247, Lyons: 90, Leblanc: 62</ref> After losing the first two games of the [[1941 NFL season|1941 season]], Rooney compelled Bell into resigning as head coach.<ref>Lyons: 90<U+2013>91</ref> Bell's coaching career ended with a 10<U+2013>46<U+2013>2 record, and for coaches with at least five years in the NFL, it is the worst record ever (as of the [[2012 NFL season|2012 season]]).<ref>Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 225; cf. MacCambridge 2005: 45</ref> His first daughter and last child, Jane Upton, was born several months after the season's conclusion.<ref>Lyons: 92</ref>

By 1943, 40% of the NFL rosters had been drafted into the [[United States Armed Forces]] for [[World War II]].<ref>Algeo: 29, 35, 46.</ref> The resulting difficulty in fielding a full-strength squad led some owners to recommend the league should shut down until the war ended. Bell auspiciously argued against this as he feared they might not be able to resume operations easily after the war, and since [[Major League Baseball]] was continuing unabated, then they should also.<ref>DeVito: 103</ref>

Throughout Bell's affiliation with the Steelers, he suffered monetarily and Rooney bought an increasing allotment of the franchise from him.<ref>Rooney; Halaas and Masich: 71</ref> Compounding Bell's problems, [[Arch Ward]] organized the [[All-American Football Conference]] (AAFC) in 1944 to displace the NFL's sovereignty in professional football.<ref>MacCambridge 2005: 13; cf. Davis 2005: 196<U+2013>197</ref> Ward's AAFC promptly began luring players to join the league,<ref>Davis 2005: 199; cf. Piascik: 11, Littlewood 166, Staudohar: 56</ref> which resulted in salaries being driven up drastically.<ref>Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 228; cf. Davis 2005: 200<U+2013>201</ref> In [[Bill Dudley]]'s contract proceedings with the Steelers, he attributed Bell's anxiety during the negotiations to the rivalry from the AAFC.<ref>Whittingham: 229</ref> Furthermore, by the end of 1945, the Steelers were in their most economically perilous situation in its history.<ref>Claassen: 251<U+2013>252</ref>

The drawing up of a regular season schedule had been a perennial source of contention among the NFL owners since the league's inception.<ref>Willis: 302, 303, 308, 371, 383</ref> The crux of the problem was the scheduling of games meant weighing the interest of owners who, early in the season, wanted their franchises to confront teams that drew the largest crowds, versus owners who wanted to play the weaker franchises to pad their team's win-loss record.<ref>Yost: 61; cf. Sullivan: 26.</ref> The resultant impasse coerced the owners, in 1946, to confer upon Bell the sole discretion in developing the league's schedule.<ref>MacCambridge 2005: 40; cf. Maule:  242, Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 248</ref> He utilized this responsibility to, early in the season, pit the weaker teams against other weak teams, and the strong teams against other strong teams.<ref name="S26;RPW248">Sullivan: 26; Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 248</ref> His goal was to augment game attendances by keeping the difference in team standings to a minimum as deep into the season as possible.<ref name="S26;RPW248"/>

On the eve of the [[1946 NFL Championship Game|1946 championship game]], Bell was notified that [[Merle Hapes]] and [[Frank Filchock]] of the [[New York Giants]] had been implicated in a bribing scandal.<ref>{{cite news |title=Merle Hapes, 75, Ex-Giant Fullback |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/21/obituaries/merle-hapes-75-ex-giant-fullback.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 21, 1994}}; cf.

DeVito: 83, Willis: 301, Maule: 242</ref>

Subsequently, he wrote an anti-gambling resolution into the league constitution,<ref>Lyons: 131<U+2013>132; cf: [http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=byY_AAAAIBAJ&sjid=M08MAAAAIBAJ&pg=3053,1968248 Bell Planning Campaign to Kill Gambling]</ref> which empowered him with the ability to permanently ban any NFL associated personnel for betting on a game or for withholding information on a game being possibly fixed.<ref>Lyons: 203<U+2013>204; cf. MacCambridge 2005: 48<U+2013>49</ref> Furthermore, to obstruct gamblers from getting inside information, he secreted the names of officials he would assign to games,<ref name="NYTH"/> and he directed each team to promulgate a precursory injury report which listed anyone who might not participate in a game.<ref>Lyons: 134<U+2013>135; cf.

====AAFC-NFL merger (1948<U+2013>1950)====
The NFL's struggle against the AAFC generated stress on wages,<ref>Lyons: 129; cf.

Lyons: 146</ref> In an unrelated matter, he apprised the owners that attendance records had shown televising games locally had a negative impact on the sale of home tickets.<ref>Coenen: 154</ref> Nevertheless, he actualized the NFL's first television contract<ref>Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 290</ref><U+2014>the [[1949 NFL Championship Game|1949 championship game]].<ref>Lyons: 156<U+2013>157</ref> Simultaneously, he dealt with a lawsuit from [[Bill Radovich]], who had been [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] for leaving the Lions and gaining employment with the AAFC.<ref>Lyons and the New York Times incorrectly list Radovich for playing with the [[San Francisco Seals (baseball)|Los Angeles Seals]].

Jr. that this lawsuit was potentially not winnable, and the ramifications from the outcome of the case weighed heavily on Bell.<ref>Lyons: 154<U+2013>155</ref>

One of the primary impediments in an AAFC-NFL merger was the supposed violation of "territorial rights" claimed by Marshall.<ref>{{cite news|last=Heller|first=Dick|title=Washington-Batlimore should be a hatefest for the ages|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-56813391.html|accessdate=16 March 2013|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]|publisher=[[HighBeam Research]] {{subscription required}}|date=25 October 1997}}</ref>  Eventually, Bell gathered enough support to effectuate a compromise with the AAFC.<ref>Davis 2005: 229</ref> In late 1949, the leagues merged,<ref name="L150_163_Mac_52">Lyons: 150, 163; cf.

====Marketing of the NFL (1950<U+2013>1956)====
In 1950, Bell originated a blackout rule into the NFL which forbid all teams to televise their home games within a 75 mile radius of their stadium - except for the Rams.<!--Why?--><ref>Coenen: 154; cf.

Hessions: 45, MacCambridge 2005: 70</ref> and this signaled a potential financial disaster.<ref>Rader: 86<U+2013>87</ref> In 1951, he licensed the [[DuMont Television Network]] to air the championship games for the next five years, and he stipulated that teams were free to develop their own television contracts independently.<ref>{{cite news | first = Dan | last = Hall | title = Hallucinations | date = 1951-05-22 | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=feST4K8J0scC&dat=19510523&printsec=frontpage&hl=en | work = [[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]] | page = 17 | quote = <nowiki>[Bell said the]</nowiki> $475,000 <nowiki>[received from the contract]</nowiki> goes into the players' pool.}}; cf.

However, preceding 1951 season, he reimposed the blackout rule on all teams in the league.<ref>Davis 2005: 271; cf. MacCambridge, 2005: 73</ref> The DOJ filed suit over this and Bell publicly retorted, "You can't give fans a game for free on TV and also expect them to go to the ballpark"; nevertheless, the suit was ordered to trial for January 1952.<ref>Coenen: 157<U+2013>158</ref> After the 1951 season ended, he gained unilateral control over the setting of a television strategy for the NFL.<ref>Rader: 86; cf.

Bell authorized a [[Pro Bowl]] to be held at the end of each season in order to showcase the talents of the best players.<ref>Brown with Clary: 214</ref> But in the early 1950s, on the field activities sometimes denigrated to borderline ''assault and battery''<ref>Ratterman; with Deindorfer: 125</ref> with teams' star players being viciously targeted by opposing players.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1128848/1/index.htm |title=Football Is Getting Too Vicious|author=Graham, Otto |date=October 11, 1954 |work=[[Sports Illustrated]]}}; cf.

[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1132736/1/index.htm I Don't Believe There Is Dirty Football]</ref>

Bell was criticized for censoring TV broadcasts, a charge he dismissed as not pertinent because he believed he was not impeding the print media but only advertising a product.<ref>Lyons: 282</ref> After CBS and NBC gained the rights to broadcast the games in 1956,<ref>Patton: 37; cf Rader: 87</ref> he advised the franchises to avoid criticizing the games or the officials, and forewarned that TV would give "'us our greatest opportunity to sell the <nowiki>NFL</nowiki> and everyone must present to the public the greatest games&nbsp;... combined with the finest sportsmanship.'"<ref>Maraniss: 168<U+2013>169</ref> This relationship with television was the beginning of the NFL's rise to becoming America's most popular sport.<ref>Lomax: 16</ref>

====Compromise with the NFLPA (1956<U+2013>1957)====
In [[Radovich v. National Football League]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled in Radovich's favor and declared the NFL was subject to antitrust laws,<ref>Coenen: 182; cf. Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 293</ref> and the implication was that the legality of the draft and [[reserve clause]] were dubious.<ref>Coenen: 182; cf. Lyons: 255<U+2013>256</ref> Bell pressed a case in the media that the NFL should be exempted from antitrust regulations and proffered the league was a sport and not a business.<ref>Lyons: 261</ref> He invited an investigation from Congress with respect to the court's ruling.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PRsfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3pkEAAAAIBAJ&dq=bert%20bell&pg=7199%2C6474989 |title=Pro Football Would Welcome Probe, Says NFL Commissioner Bert Bell | date=February 27, 1957 | work=[[The Tuscaloosa News]] | page = 8}}</ref> The [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary]] committee, chaired by [[Emanuel Celler]]<U+2014>who believed the draft was illegal and should be abolished, convened in July 1957 to discuss the ramifications of the Radovich decision.<ref>Carroll: 199</ref> [[Red Grange]] and Bell testified at the committee's solicitation and argued the draft was essential to the sport's success.<ref>U.S. House Committee III, 1957, p. 2596; cf.

====Final days (1958<U+2013>1959) ====
For the 1958 season, the durations of timeouts was extended from 60 to 90 seconds<ref>Gifford; with Richmond: 121; cf.
