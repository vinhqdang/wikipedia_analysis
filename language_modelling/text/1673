'''Asperger syndrome''' or '''Asperger's syndrome''' is an [[autism spectrum]] disorder that is characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. It differs from other autism spectrum disorders by its relative preservation of [[language development|linguistic]] and [[cognitive development]]. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and atypical use of language are frequently reported.<ref name="McPartland"/><ref name="Baskin"/>

Asperger syndrome is named for the Austrian pediatrician [[Hans Asperger]] who, in 1944, described children in his practice who lacked [[nonverbal communication]] skills, demonstrated limited [[empathy]] with their peers, and were physically clumsy.<ref name=ha/> Fifty years later, it was standardized as a [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], but many questions remain about aspects of the disorder.<ref name=Woodbury-Smith/> For example, there is doubt about whether it is distinct from [[high-functioning autism]] (HFA);<ref name="Klin"/> partly because of this, its [[prevalence]] is not firmly established.<ref name=McPartland/> The diagnosis of Asperger's has been proposed to be eliminated, replaced by a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder on a severity scale.<ref name=Wallis/>

The exact [[etiology|cause]] is unknown, although research supports the likelihood of a [[genetics|genetic]] basis; [[neuroimaging|brain imaging]] techniques have not identified a clear common pathology.<ref name=McPartland/> There is no single treatment, and the effectiveness of particular interventions is supported by only limited data.<ref name=McPartland/> Intervention is aimed at improving symptoms and function. The mainstay of management is [[behavioral therapy]], focusing on specific deficits to address poor communication skills, obsessive or repetitive routines, and physical clumsiness.<ref name=NINDS/> Most individuals improve over time, but difficulties with communication, social adjustment and [[independent living]] continue into adulthood.<ref name=Woodbury-Smith/> Some researchers and people with Asperger's have advocated a shift in attitudes toward the view that it is a difference, rather than a disability that must be treated or cured.<ref name=Clarke/>

==Classification==
Asperger syndrome (AS) is one of the [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD) or [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD), which are a [[spectrum disorder|spectrum of psychological conditions]] that are characterized by abnormalities of [[social interaction]] and communication that pervade the individual's functioning, and by restricted and repetitive interests and behavior. Like other psychological development disorders, ASD begins in infancy or childhood, has a steady course without remission or relapse, and has impairments that result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain.<ref name=ICD-10-F84.0>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf80.htm+f840 |year=2006 |accessdate=2007-06-25 |title= International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems |edition= 10th ([[ICD-10]]) |author= World Health Organization |chapter= F84.

==Characteristics==
A [[pervasive developmental disorder]], Asperger syndrome is distinguished by a pattern of symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language.<ref name=BehaveNet>{{cite book |title= Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition= 4th, text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) |author= American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |chapter= Diagnostic criteria for 299.80 Asperger's Disorder (AD) |chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm |accessdate=2007-06-28 |publisher=<!-- pacify Citation bot --> |location=<!-- pacify Citation bot --> }}</ref> Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided verbosity, restricted [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis.<ref name=Klin>{{cite journal |journal= Rev Bras Psiquiatr |year=2006 |volume=28 |issue= suppl 1 |pages=S3<U+2013>S11 |title= Autism and Asperger syndrome: an overview |author= Klin A |doi=10.1590/S1516-44462006000500002 |pmid=16791390 |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462006000500002&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en}}</ref>

===Social interaction===
{{further|[[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism#Asperger syndrome and interpersonal relationships|Asperger syndrome and interpersonal relationships]]}}

The lack of demonstrated [[empathy]] is possibly the most dysfunctional aspect of Asperger syndrome.<ref name=Baskin/> Individuals with AS experience difficulties in basic elements of social interaction, which may include a failure to develop friendships or to seek shared enjoyments or achievements with others (for example, showing others objects of interest), a lack of social or emotional [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]], and impaired [[Nonverbal communication|nonverbal behaviors]] in areas such as [[eye contact]], [[facial expression]], posture, and gesture.<ref name=McPartland>{{cite journal |author= McPartland J, Klin A |title= Asperger's syndrome |journal= Adolesc Med Clin |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=771<U+2013>88 |year=2006 |pmid=17030291 |doi= 10.1016/j.admecli.2006.06.010}}</ref>

Unlike those with autism, people with AS are not usually withdrawn around others; they approach others, even if awkwardly. For example, a person with AS may engage in a one-sided, long-winded speech about a favorite topic, while misunderstanding or not recognizing the listener's feelings or reactions, such as a need for privacy or haste to leave.<ref name=Klin/> This social awkwardness has been called "active but odd".<ref name=McPartland/> This failure to react appropriately to social interaction may appear as disregard for other people's feelings, and may come across as insensitive.<ref name=Klin/><br />
However, not all individuals with AS will approach others. Some of them may even display [[selective mutism]], speaking not at all to most people and excessively to specific people. Some may choose to talk only to people they like.<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/912296-overview</ref>

The cognitive ability of children with AS often allows them to articulate [[social norms]] in a laboratory context,<ref name=McPartland/> where they may be able to show a theoretical understanding of other people's emotions; however, they typically have difficulty acting on this knowledge in fluid, real-life situations.<ref name=Klin/> People with AS may analyze and distill their observation of social interaction into rigid behavioral guidelines, and apply these rules in awkward ways, such as forced eye contact, resulting in a demeanor that appears rigid or socially naive. Childhood desire for companionship can become numbed through a history of failed social encounters.<ref name=McPartland/>

The [[hypothesis]] that individuals with AS are predisposed to violent or criminal behavior has been investigated but is not supported by data.<ref name="McPartland"/><ref>{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |year=2008 |title= Offending behaviour in adults with Asperger syndrome |author= Allen D, Evans C, Hider A, Hawkins S, Peckett H, Morgan H |pmid=17805955 |doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0442-9 |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=748<U+2013>58}}</ref> More evidence suggests children with AS are victims rather than victimizers.<ref name=Tsatsanis>{{cite journal |journal= Child Adolesc Psychiatr Clin N Am |year=2003 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=47<U+2013>63 |title= Outcome research in Asperger syndrome and autism |author= Tsatsanis KD |pmid=12512398 |url=http://www.childpsych.theclinics.com/article/PIIS1056499302000561/fulltext |doi=10.1016/S1056-4993(02)00056-1}}</ref> A 2008 review found that an overwhelming number of reported violent criminals with AS had coexisting [[psychiatric disorders]] such as [[schizoaffective disorder]].<ref>{{cite journal |author= Newman SS, Ghaziuddin M |title= Violent crime in Asperger syndrome: the role of psychiatric comorbidity |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |volume=38 |issue=10 |pages=1848<U+2013>52 |year=2008 |pmid=18449633 |doi=10.1007/s10803-008-0580-8}}</ref>

===Restricted and repetitive interests and behavior===

People with Asperger syndrome often display behavior, interests, and activities that are restricted and repetitive and are sometimes abnormally intense or focused. They may stick to inflexible routines, move in [[Stereotypy|stereotyped]] and repetitive ways, or preoccupy themselves with parts of objects.<ref name=BehaveNet/>

Pursuit of specific and narrow areas of interest is one of the most striking features of AS.<ref name=McPartland/> Individuals with AS may collect volumes of detailed information on a relatively narrow topic such as weather data or star names, without necessarily having genuine understanding of the broader topic.<ref name=McPartland/><ref name=Klin/> For example, a child might memorize camera model numbers while caring little about photography.<ref name=McPartland/> This behavior is usually apparent by grade school, typically age 5 or 6 in the United States.<ref name=McPartland/> Although these special interests may change from time to time, they typically become more unusual and narrowly focused, and often dominate social interaction so much that the entire family may become immersed. Because narrow topics often capture the interest of children, this symptom may go unrecognized.<ref name=Klin/>

Stereotyped and repetitive motor behaviors are a core part of the diagnosis of AS and other ASDs.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |year=2005 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=145<U+2013>58 |title= Repetitive behavior profiles in Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism |author= South M, Ozonoff S, McMahon WM |doi=10.1007/s10803-004-1992-8 |pmid=15909401}}</ref> They include hand movements such as flapping or twisting, and complex whole-body movements.<ref name=BehaveNet/> These are typically repeated in longer bursts and look more voluntary or ritualistic than [[tic]]s, which are usually faster, less rhythmical and less often symmetrical.<ref name=RapinTS>{{cite journal |author= Rapin I |title= Autism spectrum disorders: relevance to Tourette syndrome |journal= Adv Neurol |volume=85 |pages=89<U+2013>101 |year=2001 |pmid=11530449}}</ref>

===Speech and language===
Although individuals with Asperger syndrome acquire language skills without significant general delay and their speech typically lacks significant abnormalities, [[language acquisition]] and use is often atypical.<ref name=Klin/> Abnormalities include [[verbosity]], abrupt transitions, literal interpretations and miscomprehension of [[nuance]], use of [[metaphor]] meaningful only to the speaker, [[Auditory processing disorder|auditory perception deficits]], unusually [[pedant]]ic, [[Register (linguistics)|formal]] or [[Idiosyncrasy#Psychiatry|idiosyncratic]] speech, and oddities in [[loudness]], [[Tone (linguistics)|pitch]], [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], and [[rhythm]].<ref name=McPartland/>

Three aspects of communication patterns are of clinical interest: poor [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], tangential and circumstantial speech, and marked verbosity. Although [[inflection]] and intonation may be less rigid or monotonic than in autism, people with AS often have a limited range of intonation: speech may be unusually fast, jerky or loud. Speech may convey a sense of [[Coherence (linguistics)|incoherence]]; the conversational style often includes monologues about topics that bore the listener, fails to provide [[Context (language use)|context]] for comments, or fails to suppress internal thoughts. Individuals with AS may fail to monitor whether the listener is interested or engaged in the conversation. The speaker's conclusion or point may never be made, and attempts by the listener to elaborate on the speech's content or logic, or to shift to related topics, are often unsuccessful.<ref name=Klin/>

Children with AS may have an unusually sophisticated vocabulary at a young age and have been colloquially called "little professors", but have difficulty understanding [[figurative language]] and tend to use language literally.<ref name=McPartland/> Children with AS appear to have particular weaknesses in areas of nonliteral language that include humor, irony, and teasing. Although individuals with AS usually understand the cognitive basis of [[humor]] they seem to lack understanding of the intent of humor to share enjoyment with others.<ref name=Kasari/> Despite strong evidence of impaired humor appreciation, anecdotal reports of humor in individuals with AS seem to challenge some psychological theories of AS and autism.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Lyons V, Fitzgerald M |title= Humor in autism and Asperger syndrome |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=521<U+2013>31 |year=2004 |pmid=15628606 |doi=10.1007/s10803-004-2547-8}}</ref>

===Other===
Individuals with Asperger syndrome may have signs or symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but can affect the individual or the family.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Filipek PA, Accardo PJ, Baranek GT ''et al.'' |title=The screening and diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorders |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=1999 |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=439<U+2013>84 |doi=10.1023/A:1021943802493 |pmid=10638459 }}</ref> These include differences in perception and problems with motor skills, sleep, and emotions.

Children with AS may be delayed in acquiring skills requiring motor dexterity, such as riding a bicycle or opening a jar, and may seem to move awkwardly or feel "uncomfortable in their own skin". They may be poorly coordinated, or have an odd or bouncy gait or posture, poor handwriting, or problems with visual-motor integration.<ref name="McPartland"/><ref name="Klin"/> They may show problems with [[proprioception]] (sensation of body position) on measures of [[apraxia]] (motor planning disorder), balance, [[tandem gait]], and finger-thumb apposition.

Children with AS are more likely to have sleep problems, including difficulty in falling asleep, frequent [[middle-of-the-night insomnia|nocturnal awakenings]], and early morning awakenings.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= J Intellect Disabil Res |year=2005 |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=260<U+2013>8 |title= A survey of sleep problems in autism, Asperger's disorder and typically developing children |author= Polimeni MA, Richdale AL, Francis AJ |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2788.2005.00642.x |pmid=15816813}}</ref><ref name=Tani/> AS is also associated with high levels of [[alexithymia]], which is difficulty in identifying and describing one's emotions.<ref>Alexithymia and AS:

==Causes==
{{See|Causes of autism}}
Hans Asperger described common symptoms among his patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to Asperger syndrome. Although no specific gene has yet been identified, multiple factors are believed to play a role in the [[Expressivity|expression]] of autism, given the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] variability seen in children with AS.<ref name=McPartland/><ref name="Foster"/> Evidence for a genetic link is the tendency for AS to run in families and an observed higher [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of family members who have behavioral symptoms similar to AS but in a more limited form (for example, slight difficulties with social interaction, language, or reading).<ref name=NINDS>{{cite web |author= National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) |date=2007-07-31 |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/asperger/detail_asperger.htm |accessdate=2007-08-24 |title= Asperger syndrome fact sheet}} NIH Publication No. 05-5624.</ref> Most research suggests that all [[Heritability of autism|autism spectrum disorders have shared genetic mechanisms]], but AS may have a stronger genetic component than autism.<ref name="McPartland"/> There is probably a common group of genes where particular [[allele]]s render an individual vulnerable to developing AS; if this is the case, the particular combination of alleles would determine the severity and symptoms for each individual with AS.<ref name=NINDS/>

A few ASD cases have been linked to exposure to [[teratogen]]s (agents that cause [[birth defect]]s) during the first eight weeks from [[Human fertilization|conception]]. Although this does not exclude the possibility that ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that it arises very early in development.<ref name=Arndt>{{cite journal |journal= Int J Dev Neurosci |year=2005 |volume=23 |issue=2<U+2013>3 |pages=189<U+2013>99 |title= The teratology of autism |author= Arndt TL, Stodgell CJ, Rodier PM |doi=10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2004.11.001 |pmid=15749245}}</ref> Many [[environmental factors]] have been hypothesized to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.<ref>{{cite journal |author= [[Michael Rutter|Rutter M]] |title= Incidence of autism spectrum disorders: changes over time and their meaning |journal= Acta Paediatr |volume=94 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=2<U+2013>15 |pmid=15858952 |doi= 10.1080/08035250410023124}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Asperger syndrome}}

Named after the Austrian pediatrician [[Hans Asperger]] (1906<U+2013>1980), Asperger syndrome is a relatively new diagnosis in the field of autism.<ref name="What'sSpecial">{{cite journal |author= Baron-Cohen S, Klin A |title= What's so special about Asperger Syndrome? |journal= Brain Cogn |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=1<U+2013>4 |year=2006 |pmid=16563588 |doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2006.02.002 |url=http://www.elsevier.com/authored_subject_sections/S05/S05_360/pdf/klin.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>
As a child, Asperger appears to have exhibited some features of the very condition named after him, such as remoteness and talent in language;<ref>{{cite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2007 |title=Did Hans Asperger (1906<U+2013>1980) have Asperger Syndrome? |author=Lyons V, Fitzgerald M |doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0382-4 |pmid=17917805 |volume=37 |pages=2020<U+2013>1 |issue=10 }}</ref> [[Hans Asperger#photo|photographs taken during his seminal work]] show that he had an earnest face with an intense gaze.<ref>{{cite book |author=Osborne L |title=American Normal: The Hidden World of Asperger Syndrome |publisher=Copernicus |year=2002 |isbn=0-387-95307-8 |page=19}}</ref> In 1944, Asperger described four children in his practice<ref name=Baskin>{{cite journal |author= Baskin JH, Sperber M, Price BH |title= Asperger syndrome revisited |journal= Rev Neurol Dis |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1<U+2013>7 |year=2006 |pmid=16596080}}</ref> who had difficulty in integrating themselves socially. The children lacked nonverbal communication skills, failed to demonstrate empathy with their peers, and were physically clumsy. Asperger called the condition "autistic psychopathy" and described it as primarily marked by [[social isolation]].<ref name=NINDS/> Unlike today's AS, autistic psychopathy could be found in people of all levels of intelligence, including those with mental retardation.<ref>{{cite book |author= Wing L |chapter= The relationship between Asperger's syndrome and Kanner's autism |editor= Frith U |title= Autism and Asperger syndrome |year=1991 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-38608-X |pages=93<U+2013>121}}</ref> In the context of the [[Nazi eugenics]] policy of sterilizing and killing social deviants and the mentally handicapped, Asperger passionately defended the value of autistic individuals, writing "We are convinced, then, that autistic people have their place in the organism of the social community. They fulfil their role well, perhaps better than anyone else could, and we are talking of people who as children had the greatest difficulties and caused untold worries to their care-givers."<ref name=ha/> Asperger also called his young patients "little professors",<ref name=ha>{{cite book |author= Asperger H; tr. and annot.

Hundreds of books, articles and websites now describe AS, and prevalence estimates have increased dramatically for ASD, with AS recognized as an important subgroup.<ref name="What'sSpecial"/> Whether it should be seen as distinct from high-functioning autism is a fundamental issue requiring further study,<ref name="Baskin"/> and there are questions about the [[empirical validation]] of the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria.<ref name="Klin"/>

==Cultural aspects==
{{See|Sociological and cultural aspects of autism}}
People with Asperger syndrome may refer to themselves in casual conversation as ''aspies'', coined by [[Liane Holliday Willey]] in 1999.<ref>{{cite book |author= Willey LH |title= Pretending to be Normal: Living with Asperger's Syndrome |publisher= Jessica Kingsley |year=1999 |isbn=1-85302-749-9}}</ref> The word ''[[neurotypical]]'' (abbreviated ''NT'') describes a person whose neurological development and state are typical, and is often used to refer to non-autistic people.
The [[Internet]] has allowed individuals with AS to communicate and [[Autistic Pride Day|celebrate]] with each other in a way that was not previously possible because of their rarity and geographic dispersal. A [[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism|subculture of aspies]] has formed. Internet sites like [[Wrong Planet]] have made it easier for individuals to connect.<ref name=Clarke>{{cite journal |journal= Disabil Soc |year=2007 |volume=22 |issue=7 |pages=761<U+2013>76 |title= 'Surplus suffering': differences between organizational understandings of Asperger's syndrome and those people who claim the 'disorder' |author= Clarke J, van Amerom G |doi=10.1080/09687590701659618}}</ref>

Autistic people have advocated a shift in perception of autism spectrum disorders as complex [[syndrome]]s rather than diseases that must be cured. Proponents of this view reject the notion that there is an "ideal" brain configuration and that any deviation from the norm is [[Anatomical pathology|pathological]]; they promote tolerance for what they call [[neurodiversity]].<ref>{{cite book |author= Williams CC |chapter= In search of an Asperger |editor= Stoddart KP |title= Children, Youth and Adults with Asperger Syndrome: Integrating Multiple Perspectives |year=2005 |publisher= Jessica Kingsley |isbn=1-84310-319-2 |pages=242<U+2013>52 |quote= The life prospects of people with AS would change if we shifted from viewing AS as a set of dysfunctions, to viewing it as a set of differences that have merit.}}</ref> These views are the basis for the [[Autism rights movement|autistic rights]] and [[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism#Autistic pride|autistic pride]] movements.<ref>{{cite book |author= Dakin CJ |chapter= Life on the outside: A personal perspective of Asperger syndrome |editor= Stoddart KP |title= Children, Youth and Adults with Asperger Syndrome: Integrating Multiple Perspectives |year=2005 |publisher= Jessica Kingsley |isbn=1-84310-319-2 |pages=352<U+2013>61}}</ref> There is a contrast between the attitude of adults with self-identified AS, who typically do not want to be cured and are proud of their identity, and parents of children with AS, who typically seek assistance and a cure for their children.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Clarke J, van Amerom G |title= Asperger's syndrome: differences between parents' understanding and those diagnosed |journal= Soc Work Health Care |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=85<U+2013>106 |year=2008 |pmid=18551831 |doi=10.1300/J010v46n03_05}}</ref>

Some researchers have argued that AS can be viewed as a different cognitive style, not a disorder or a disability,<ref name=Clarke/> and that it should be removed from the standard ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'', much as [[homosexuality]] was removed.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Disabil Soc |year=2009 |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=343<U+2013>55 |title=Reframing Asperger syndrome: lessons from other challenges to the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual'' and ICIDH approaches |author=Allred S |doi=10.1080/09687590902789511 }}</ref> In a 2002 paper, [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] wrote of those with AS, "In the social world there is no great benefit to a precise eye for detail, but in the worlds of maths, computing, cataloguing, music, linguistics, engineering, and science, such an eye for detail can lead to success rather than failure." Baron-Cohen cited two reasons why it might still be useful to consider AS to be a disability: to ensure provision for legally required special support, and to recognize emotional difficulties from reduced empathy.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Focus Autism Other Dev Disabl |year=2002 |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=186<U+2013>91 |title= Is Asperger syndrome necessarily viewed as a disability? |author= Baron-Cohen S |doi=10.1177/10883576020170030801}} A preliminary, freely readable draft, with slightly different wording in the quoted text, is in: {{cite web |url=http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2002_BC_ASDisability.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-12-02 |year=2002 |author= Baron-Cohen S |title= Is Asperger's syndrome necessarily a disability? |publisher= Autism Research Centre |location= Cambridge}}</ref> It has been argued that the genes for Asperger's combination of abilities have operated throughout recent [[human evolution]] and have made remarkable contributions to human history.<ref>{{cite book |title= Foundations of Evolutionary Psychology |chapter= The evolution of brain mechanisms for social behavior |author= Baron-Cohen S |pages=415<U+2013>32 |editor= Crawford C, Krebs D (eds.) |publisher= Lawrence Erlbaum |date=2008 |isbn=0-8058-5957-8}}</ref>
