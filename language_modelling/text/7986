The etymology of "Delhi" is uncertain but many possibilities exist.

Delhi is an expansive area, in its extremity it spans from Sarup Nagar in the north to Rajorki in the south. Najafghar is the furthest point west, and the river Yamuna is its (relatively conservative eastern extremity). The NCR encompasses points south and east of the said border, namely Noida and DLF.
Oddly, the main expanse of Delhi does not follow a specific geographical features (for example, converse to London, which centered around the Thames, has its northern limit at its first Hill, Hampstead Heath, and its southern limit at the river, similarly its western limit is the bottom of a basin - Paddington) The main city area of Delhi does not end until Saket in the South, whilst the northern limit is easily the Connaught Place, and the western limit is easily the NH8
The terrain of Delhi is widely erratic. It changes from plain agricultural fields in the north, to dry, arid hills (an offshoot of the [[Aravalli Hills]] of [[Rajasthan]]) in the south. Their used to be large natural lakes in the southern part of the city, but most of them have dried up due to mining. The city is bordered by river Yamuna, that separates the, although there is a good connectivity between them, with a number of bridges and the [[Metro]] subway, areas east of the river are not in the City of Delhi. The entirety of the city, including New Delhi, lies west of the river. East of the river still continues the NCR, but is not Delhi. 

Delhi is located at {{coord|28.61|N|77.23|E|}}, and lies in [[northern India]]. It borders the Indian states of [[Uttar Pradesh]] on East and [[Haryana]] on West, North and South. Delhi lies almost entirely in the [[Gangetic plains]]. Two prominent features of the geography of Delhi are the [[Yamuna]] flood plain and the [[Delhi ridge]]. The low-lying Yamuna flood plains provide fertile [[alluvial soil]] suitable for agriculture. However, these plains are prone to recurrent [[floods]].

===Climate===
{{see also|Climate of Delhi}}
Delhi has a continental climate with high variation between summer and winter temperatures. Summers are long, extremely hot, from early April to mid-October, with the [[monsoon]] season in between. They are dangerous, and have, in the recent past, taken a huge toll. Beginning of March sees a reversal in the direction of wind, from the north-western direction, to the south-western. These bring the hot waves from Rajasthan, carrying sand and are a characteristic of the Delhi summer. These are called [[loo_(wind)| loo]]. The months of February to May see a time of hot, prickling heat, with highly oxidizing conditions. At the end of June, humidity increases, bringing some respite in fluctuating rains in the months of July to September. Winter starts in late October and peaks in January and is notorious for its heavy fog.<ref name=Fog>{{cite news

==Civic administration==
{{seealso|Divisions of Delhi|Districts of Delhi|List of towns in National Capital Territory of Delhi}}
As of July 2007, the National Capital Territory of Delhi comprises nine districts, 27&nbsp;[[tehsil]]s, 59&nbsp;census towns, 165&nbsp;villages and three statutory towns{{ndash}} the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD); the New Delhi Municipal Committee (NDMC); and the Delhi Cantonment Board (DCB).<ref name="ecosurv0102chap3">{{cite web |url=http://delhiplanning.nic.in/Economic%20Survey/Ecosur2001-02/PDF/chap3(table).PDF |title=Table 3.1: Delhi Last 10 Years (1991<U+2013>2001) <U+2014> Administrative Set Up |accessdate=2007-07-03 |format=PDF |work=Economic Survey of Delhi, 2001<U+2013>2002 |publisher=Planning Department, Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi |pages=p177}}</ref>
[[Image:Delhi districts.svg|thumb|Map showing the nine districts of Delhi]]

The Delhi metropolitan area lies within the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT). The NCT has three local municipal corporations: [[Municipal Corporation of Delhi]] (MCD), [[New Delhi Municipal Council]] (NDMC) and [[Delhi Cantonment|Delhi Cantonment Board]]. MCD is one of the largest municipal corporations in the world providing civic amenities to an estimated 13.78&nbsp;million people.<ref name="MCD"> {{cite web |url=http://www.mcdonline.gov.in/|title=About Us|publisher=Municipal Corporation of Delhi|accessdate=2006-05-13}}</ref> The capital of India, New Delhi, falls under the administration of NDMC. The chairperson of the NDMC is appointed by the Government of India in consultation with the [[Chief Minister of Delhi]].

Delhi has four major satellite cities which lie outside the National Capital Territory of Delhi. These are [[Gurgaon]] and [[Faridabad]] (in Haryana), and [[New Okhla Industrial Development Authority|NOIDA]] and [[Ghaziabad, India|Ghaziabad]], in Uttar Pradesh. Delhi is divided into nine districts. Each district (division) is headed by a Deputy Commissioner and has three subdivisions. A Subdivision Magistrate heads each subdivision. All Deputy Commissioners report to the Divisional Commissioner. The District Administration of Delhi is the enforcing department for all kinds of State and Central Government policies and exercises supervisory powers over numerous other functionaries of the Government.

The [[Delhi High Court]] has jurisdiction over Delhi. Delhi also has lower courts: the [[Small Causes Court]] for civil cases, and the [[Sessions Court]] for criminal cases. The [[Delhi Police]], headed by the [[Police Commissioner of Delhi|Police Commissioner]], is one of the largest metropolitan police forces in the world.<ref name=largepolice>{{cite web

==Government and politics==
[[Image:NorthBlock.jpg|thumb|right|The [[North Block]], built in 1931 during the [[British Raj]], houses key government offices]]
Earlier known as a special [[union territory]], the National Capital Territory of Delhi has its own Legislative Assembly, Lieutenant Governor, Council of Ministers and Chief Minister. The legislative assembly seats are filled by direct election from territorial constituencies in the NCT. However, the Union Government of India and the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi jointly administer New Delhi. New Delhi, a city in Delhi, is the seat of both the National Capital Territory of Delhi and the Government of India.

While services like transport and others are taken care of by the Delhi Govt., services such as the police are directly under the control of the Central Government. The legislative assembly was re-established in 1993 for the first time since 1956, with direct federal rule in the span. In addition, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) handles civic administration for the city as part of the Panchayati Raj act. New Delhi, an urban area in Delhi, is the seat of both the State Government of Delhi and the Government of India. The [[Parliament of India]], the [[Rashtrapati Bhavan]] (Presidential Palace) and the [[Supreme Court of India]] are located in New Delhi. There are 80 assembly constituencies and seven [[Lok Sabha]] (Indian parliament's lower house) constituencies in Delhi.<ref name=assmbconst>{{cite web

Delhi was a traditional stronghold of the [[Indian National Congress]], also known as the Congress Party. In the 1990s the [[BJP|Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) under the leadership of [[Madan Lal Khurana]] came into power. However in 1998, Congress regained power under [[Sheila Dixit]], who is the incumbent Chief Minister. The Congress retained power in the Legislative Assembly in the 2003 and 2008 elections.

The DVB itself cannot generate adequate power to meet the city's demand and borrows power from India's Northern Region Grid.

Several industrial units in Delhi rely on their own electrical generators to meet their electric demand and for back up during Delhi's frequent and disruptive power cuts. A few years ago, the power sector in Delhi was handed over to private companies. The distribution of electricity is carried out by companies run by [[Tata Power]] and [[Reliance Energy]].

[[Auto rickshaws]] are a popular means of public transportation in Delhi, as they charge a lower fare than taxis. Most run on [[Compressed Natural Gas]] (CNG) and are yellow and green in colour. [[Taxicab|Taxi]]s are not an integral part of Delhi public transport, though they are easily available. Private operators operate most taxis, and most neighborhoods have a taxi stand from which taxis can be ordered or picked up. In addition, air-conditioned [[Taxicab|radio taxis]], which can be ordered by calling a central number, have become increasingly popular, charging a flat rate of Rs. 15 per kilometer.
