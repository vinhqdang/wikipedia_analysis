'''gnuLinEx''', or '''LinEx''', is a [[Debian]]-based [[GNU]]-[[Linux]] [[operating system]] that uses [[GNOME]] for its [[Desktop environment|desktop]]. An initiative of the regional government of [[Extremadura]], [[Spain]], gnuLinEx is intended to be used in all schools in Extremadura, as well as in official institutions. It is actively promoted for business and home use as well. gnuLinEx is only compatible with computers based on the [[i386]] [[CPU design|architecture]]. The aim of the project is the promotion of a technologically-literate information-based society in order to improve the citizens' quality of life.

==Limitations==
#The option to purchase hardware bundled with gnuLinEx the way [[Microsoft Windows]] is preinstalled with many new computers by hardware manufacturers is not common.
#Extremadura has changed the names of many programs installed by default with the distribution, which has caused some confusion amongst users. Some see it as a virtue for helping them to remember their favourite applications with Spanish instead of English names. The 2004 version includes the possibility of choosing the original icons and names of all the applications included in gnuLinEx.

==School LinEx==
School LinEx is a gnuLinEx variant oriented toward teachers. It consists of three user profiles. Each profile is personalised for a particular student with content and software for each pupil.

==Users==
200,000 LinEx CDs have been distributed for free by local newspapers and 70,000 copies of the operating system have been downloaded from the website as of May 2003. About 10% of the inhabitants of Extremadura are estimated to use LinEx.

==gnuLinEx in secondary schools==
Nowadays gnuLinEx is principally in the public institutes of secondary education of the Extremaduran community, having a computer (with gnuLinEx installed) for every two pupils, or for every table.
