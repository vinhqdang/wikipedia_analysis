'''Hurricane Nora''' was the fourteenth named [[tropical cyclone]] and seventh hurricane of the [[1997 Pacific hurricane season]]. The September storm formed off the [[Pacific ocean|Pacific]] coast of [[Mexico]], and aided by waters warmed by [[El Ni<U+00F1>o]], eventually peaked at Category&nbsp;4 intensity on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]].

Nora intensified and weakened quickly before taking an unusual path, which lead it to make landfall twice as a hurricane in [[Baja California]]. After landfall, its remnants affected the [[Southwestern United States]] with tropical storm-force winds, torrential rain and flooding. Nora is blamed for two direct casualties in [[Mexico]], as well as substantial beach erosion on the Mexican coast, [[flash flood]]ing in Baja California, and record precipitation in [[Arizona]]. Nora persisted far inland, it was only the third known tropical cyclone to reach Arizona while tropical.

== Storm history ==
{{storm path|Nora 1997 track.png}}
Nora formed early on [[September 16]], [[1997]], 290&nbsp;miles (460&nbsp;km) southwest of the Mexican port of [[Acapulco]], [[Guerrero]], from the same [[tropical wave]] that had earlier created [[1997 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Erika|Hurricane Erika]]. Due to favorable conditions associated with [[El Ni<U+00F1>o]],<ref name="MWRNora">{{cite journal |author=Farf<U+00E1>n, Luis M. and Joseph Zehnder|date = August 2001 | title=An Analysis of the Landfall of Hurricane Nora | journal = [[Monthly Weather Review]] | format=PDF | accessdate=2006-02-26 | volume = 129 | issue 8 | url=http://ams.allenpress.com/archive/1520-0493/129/8/pdf/i1520-0493-129-8-2073.pdf}}</ref> the tropical disturbance quickly achieved deep [[convection]] and became well-organized. By 6 a.m. [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], the [[United States|U.S.]] [[National Hurricane Center]] had designated the disturbance as Tropical Depression Sixteen-E. Half a day later, it had gained enough strength to be named Tropical Storm Nora.<ref name="NHCNora">{{cite web| publisher =[[National Hurricane Center]] | date = [[October 30]], [[1997]] | title = Preliminary Report: Hurricane Nora: 16 <U+2013> 26 September 1997 | author = Rappaport, Edward N. | accessdate=2006-02-20| url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1997nora.html}}</ref>

A [[high pressure area]] over northern Mexico forced the storm to move west-northwest for the first few days. During that time, Nora kept intensifying, becoming a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] by noon UTC on [[September 18]]. Next, Nora slowed and became stationary for two days from [[September 18]]. The eye vanished, and convection began to decrease. This was presumed to have happened because of a drop in sea-surface temperatures. The cool waters temporarily weakened Nora's winds to 75&nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (120&nbsp;[[kilometre per hour|km/h]]) down from a maximum of 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="NHCNora"/> After leaving the area of cool waters, Nora began moving nearly parallel to Mexico's western coast. There was a period of rapid intensification and the eye reappeared. Cloud tops cooled and at midday UTC on [[September 21]], Nora reached its peak intensity of 950&nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]] and 135&nbsp;mph (210&nbsp;km/h) winds, a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane.<ref name="NHCNora"/> The peak was brief as Nora then encountered cool waters in the wake of [[Hurricane Linda (1997)|Hurricane Linda]]. They weakened Nora's winds to 80&nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (130&nbsp;[[kilometre per hour|km/h]]) by [[September 23]] and broke its [[eyewall]].<ref name="NHCNora"/>

Nora then crossed an area of abnormally warm water near the west coast of the [[Baja California Peninsula]]. It restrengthened slightly before making its first landfall near [[Bah<U+00ED>a Tortugas]], [[Baja California Sur]].<ref name="SMNNora">{{es icon}} {{cite web| author=Servicio Meteorol<U+00F3>gico Nacional ([[Mexico]])| year=1997| title=Hurac<U+00E1>n Nora| publisher=Comis<U+00F3>n Nacional del Agua| accessdate=2006-02-21| url=http://smn.cna.gob.mx/ciclones/tempo1997/pacifico/nora/nora.html}}</ref> When Nora was inland, the area of the storm located in the [[Gulf of California]] began to reintensify.<ref name="MWRNora"/> Hurricane Nora then made a second landfall about 60&nbsp;miles (95&nbsp;km) south-southeast of [[San Fernando, Baja California|San Fernando]], [[Baja California]].<ref name="NHCNora"/>

At landfall, a [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] was accelerating Nora northwards, causing it to reach a forward speed of 30&nbsp;mph (50&nbsp;km/h). Late on [[September 25]] (UTC), still a tropical storm, it entered the [[continental United States]] at the [[California]]-[[Arizona]] state line. Nora began to weaken rapidly, and was downgraded to a tropical depression three hours later,<ref name="NHCNora"/> while located between [[Blythe, California|Blythe]] and [[Needles, California]].<ref name="MWR 1997 EPac summary">{{cite journal | author = Lawrence, Miles B. | title = Eastern North Pacific Hurricane Season of 1997 | url = http://ams.allenpress.com/archive/1520-0493/127/10/pdf/i1520-0493-127-10-2440.pdf | format = PDF | date = October 1999 | volume = 127 | issue = 10 | pages = 2448 <U+2013> 50 | accessdate = 2006-12-18 | journal = [[Monthly Weather Review]]}}</ref> Nora reached [[Arizona]] while still tropical, becoming the third known system to do so.<ref name="MCFCD">{{cite web|author=Flood Control District of [[Maricopa County]]|year=1997|title=TS Nora Storm Report|accessdate=2006-02-26|url=http://156.42.96.39/alert/nora/nora_rpt.html}}</ref> Nora degenerated over land, and the low-level center moved towards the north-northeast. A remnant circulation aloft persisted, however, and was likely responsible for a period of near hurricane-force winds observed at the [[National Weather Service|NWS]] [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]], [[Utah]] [[Doppler weather radar]]. The remnants gradually became more diffuse over the following two days while moving generally northeastward, through portions of Utah, [[Colorado]], [[Idaho]] and [[Wyoming]].<ref name="NHCNora"/>

== Preparations ==
While Nora stayed off the Pacific coast of Mexico, the ''[[Servicio Meteorol<U+00F3>gico Nacional]]'' (National Meteorological Service) issued a [[hurricane watch]] for the coast between [[L<U+00E1>zaro C<U+00E1>rdenas, Michoac<U+00E1>n|L<U+00E1>zaro C<U+00E1>rdenas]], [[Michoac<U+00E1>n]], and [[Puerto Vallarta]], [[Jalisco]],<ref name="NHCNora"/> and several major ports in the shoreline closed to navigation.<ref name="CNN Ports">{{cite news|title=North-moving Nora lashes Baja's southern tip|publisher=Associated Press|date=[[September 23]] [[1997]]|accessdate=2006-04-10|url=http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/9709/23/nora.mexico/index.html}}
</ref> As the storm moved away from the mainland coast and towards the [[Baja California Peninsula]], about 500 people were evacuated from their homes near [[Cabo San Lucas]], [[Baja California Sur]], and placed in shelters to prepare for the storm's impact. At the same time, in [[Sonora]], another 50 were evacuated from a fishing camp in [[Guaymas]].<ref name="CNN San Lucas">{{cite news|title=Hurricane Nora lashes Baja California|publisher=Associated Press|date=[[September 24]] [[1997]]|accessdate=2006-05-11| url=http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/9709/23/nora/index.html}}
</ref> Meanwhile, the SMN issued tropical storm warnings along the Baja California coast, as well as hurricane watches and warnings around the entire Gulf of California between [[Santa Rosal<U+00ED>a, Baja California Sur|Santa Rosal<U+00ED>a]], [[Baja California Sur]], and [[Bah<U+00ED>a Kino]], [[Sonora]].

In [[September 24]], Arizona Governor [[Jane Dee Hull]] activated an emergency response center to prepare the state's response to the [[flash flooding]] the storm would cause on the dry desert floor,<ref name="CNN Preparations"/> and [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]] residents began to fill approximately 55,000 sandbags to contain the possible flooding.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hurricane Nora nears Mexico|publisher=Associated Press|date=[[September 24]] [[1997]]| accessdate=2006-05-11|url=http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/9709/24/nora.update.2p/index.html}}</ref> Hull also activated the state's [[United States National Guard|National Guard]], and sent [[drinking water]] and electric generators to Yuma.<ref name="CNN AZ Preps">{{cite news|title=Nora weakens, but heavy rains threaten U.S.|publisher=Associated Press|date=[[September 25]] [[1997]]| accessdate=2006-05-11|url=http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/9709/25/nora1130a/}}</ref> Further inland, the [[National Weather Service]] issued [[flash flood]] watches for western Arizona, southeastern California, southwestern [[Colorado]], southern [[Nevada]] and southern [[Utah]] on [[September 26]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|publisher=NOAA|title=Storm Summary for Tropical Depression Nora, 4 a.m. EDT [[September 26]], [[1997]]|accessdate=2006-03-06| url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/1997/nora/92606ns1.html}}</ref>

== Impact ==
Hurricane Nora caused two direct deaths in Mexico and three or four indirect ones in the United States. Although the total cost of damage is not known, Nora caused up to several hundred millions of dollars of damage. The system also dumped heavy rain in the United States and Mexico, which caused flooding and power outages.<ref name="NHCNora"/>

=== Mexico ===
[[Image:Nora 1997 Radar.png|thumb|Hurricane Nora over northern Mexico as seen on Radar in [[Yuma, Arizona]].]]
Nora killed two in Mexico: an electrocution by a downed power line in [[Mexicali]], [[Baja California]], and a diver caught in strong underwater currents created by Nora off the coast of the [[San Quint<U+00ED>n, Baja California|San Quintin Valley]].<ref name="NHCNora"/>

Although Nora's center of circulation remained well offshore from southwestern mainland Mexico, the [[Associated Press]] reported that waves to {{convert|20|ft|m}} hit that coastline, destroying dozens of homes.<ref name="CNN MX Pac">{{cite news|title=Hurricane Nora lashes Mexico's Pacific coast|publisher=Associated Press|date=[[September 22]] [[1997]]| accessdate=2006-05-11|url=http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/9709/22/nora/index.html}}</ref> Nora's winds also produced rough seas and high waves, which caused in substantial [[coastal erosion|beach erosion]], particularly around [[Acapulco]], where the [[Pie de la Cuesta, Guerrero|Pie de la Cuesta]] beaches were washed away.<ref name="NHCNora"/> In the [[States of Mexico|states]] of [[Guerrero]] and [[Jalisco]], Nora tore down trees and washed away the foundations of homes, albeit without causing any injuries.<ref name="CNN MX Pac"/>

Heavy rains also fell along its northeast periphery, with the highest amounts of {{convert|20.94|in|mm}} falling at La Cruz/Elota and {{convert|16.79|in|mm}} being measured at Ligui/Loreto.<ref>Hydrometeorological Prediction Center.

About 350 to 400 people were left homeless by floodwaters in the town of [[Arroyo de Santa Catarina]] in northern [[Baja California]]. Heavy damage and flooding was reported in [[San Felipe, Baja California|San Felipe]], on the northwestern shore of the [[Gulf of California]], as well as extensive beach erosion.<ref name="MWR 1997 EPac summary"/> Local roads and highways were destroyed and the town's dock was severely damaged.<ref name="SanFelipe">{{cite web | publisher = [[San Felipe, Baja California]] Official Website | title = Hurricane Nora, San Felipe, Baja California | date = September 1997 | accessdate=2006-03-29 | url = http://www.sanfelipe.com.mx/nora9247/summry1015.htm}}</ref> On the northeastern shore, at [[Puerto Pe<U+00F1>asco]], Nora blew down trees, billboards, electric wires, taco stands, and ripped sheet-metal from homes.

=== United States ===
[[Image:Nora1997filledrainblk.gif|thumb|right|Nora Rainfall for Mexico and the United States]]
In the [[United States]], there were no direct deaths blamed on the hurricane. However, the [[California Highway Patrol]] attributed three or four traffic fatalities in southern [[California]] to the weather.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nora gives Arizona a soaking|publisher=Associated Press|date=[[September 25]] [[1997]]| accessdate=2006-05-11|url=http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/9709/25/nora/}}</ref>

Damage totals in the United States are not fully known but media summaries of Nora included a loss to agriculture preliminarily estimated at several hundred million dollars, and at least one study places the figure at $150 <U+2013> 200&nbsp;million (1997 [[United States dollar|USD]]).<ref name="DroughtNLU">{{cite web|author=National Drought Mitigation Center|title=Reported Effects of the 1997 <U+2013> 98 El Ni<U+00F1>o|publisher=University of Nebraska-Lincoln|accessdate=2006-02-26 | url=http://www.drought.unl.edu/whatis/elninoanalysis.pdf}}

The Yuma radar indicated a small area with near {{convert|10|in|mm}} of rain along the northern [[Gulf of California]] coast of Baja California. In the United States, the largest total rainfall was recorded at the [[Harquahala Mountains]] in Arizona, where {{convert|11.97|in|mm}} of rainfall were recorded as a result of Nora, causing flash floods in western Arizona.<ref name="MCFCD"/>

Near [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], rainfall from the storm caused the Narrows Dam, a small [[earthen dam]], to fail.<ref name="MCFCD"/> In other locations in Arizona, California, [[Nevada]], and Utah, more than {{convert|3|in|mm}} occurred in a few localized areas,<ref name="MWRNora"/> sometimes with precipitation comparable to the entire local yearly average rainfall. Flooding was also reported in [[Somerton, Arizona|Somerton]], [[San Diego]], [[El Centro]], [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] and [[Indio]], while 12,000 people lost power in Yuma,<ref name="ISPE">{{cite web|author=Rebecca Carter|year=2002|title=Tropical Storm Impacts on Arizona and New Mexico|accessdate=2006-03-03|publisher=Climate Assessment for the Southwest Project, Institute for the Study of Planet Earth, University of Arizona| url=http://www.ispe.arizona.edu/climas/forecasts/articles/tropical_Aug2002.pdf}}</ref> as well as [[Los Angeles]] and southwestern Utah.

Despite the damage, the [[World Meteorological Organization]] did not retire the name ''Nora'' during its meeting in the spring of 1998. As a result, it was used in the [[2003 Pacific hurricane season]] and is on the [[Lists of tropical cyclone names#North Pacific east of 140W|list of names]] to be used in 2009.
