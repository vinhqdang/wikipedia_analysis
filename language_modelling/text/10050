[[Image:FairtradeQuinoa.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Certified Fair trade [[quinoa]] producers in [[Ecuador]].]]'''Fair trade''' is an organized [[social movement]] which promotes standards for international [[Manual labour|labour]], [[environmentalism]], and social policy in areas related to production of [[Fairtrade]] labelled and unlabelled [[goods]]. The movement focuses in particular on exports from developing countries to developed countries.

Fair trade's strategic intent is to deliberately work with marginalised producers and workers in order to help them move from a position of vulnerability to security and economic self-sufficiency. It also aims at empowering them to become stakeholders in their own organizations and actively play a wider role in the global arena to achieve greater equity in [[international trade]].

Fair trade proponents include a wide array of international religious, development aid, social and environmental organizations such as [[Oxfam]], [[Amnesty International]], and [[Caritas (charity)|Caritas International]].

As most [[international development|developmental efforts]], fair trade has proved itself controversial and has drawn criticism from both ends of the [[political spectrum]].  Some economists and conservative [[think tanks]] see fair trade as a type of [[subsidy]] that impedes growth.  Segments of the [[Left-wing politics|left]] criticize fair trade for not adequately challenging the current trading system.

In [[2006]], [[Fairtrade certification|Fairtrade certified]] sales amounted to approximately <U+20AC>1.6 billion worldwide, a 41 % year-to-year increase.<ref>Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (2007). www.fairtrade.net.

==Definition of fair trade==
The most widely recognized definition of fair trade was created by [[FINE]], an informal Association of the four main fair trade networks ([[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]], [[International Fair Trade Association]], [[Network of European Worldshops]] and [[European Fair Trade Association]]):<ref>European Fair Trade Association. (2006). [http://www.eftafairtrade.org/definition.asp Definition of Fair Trade] URL accessed on August 2, 2006.</ref>
{{bquote|Fair trade is a trading partnership, based on dialogue, transparency and respect, which seeks greater equity in international trade. It contributes to sustainable development by offering better trading conditions to, and securing the rights of, marginalized producers and workers - especially in the South. Fair trade organizations (backed by consumers) are engaged actively in supporting producers, awareness raising and in campaigning for changes in the rules and practice of conventional international trade.}}

==Key fair trade principles==
[[Image:Coffee beans being sorted and pulped.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Workers sorting and pulping [[coffee]] beans on a fair trade plantation in [[Guatemala]]]]
Fair trade advocates generally support the following principles and practices in trading relationships:<ref>International Fair Trade Association (2006). [http://www.ifat.org/ftrinciples.shtml Key Principles of Fair Trade] URL accessed on August 2 2006.</ref>
;Creating opportunities for economically disadvantaged producers
:Fair trade is a strategy for poverty alleviation and [[sustainable development]]. Its purpose is to create opportunities for producers who have been economically disadvantaged or marginalized by the conventional trading system.
;[[Transparency (humanities)|Transparency]] and accountability
:Fair trade involves transparent management and commercial relations to deal fairly and respectfully with trading partners.
;Capacity building
:Fair trade is a means to develop producers<U+2019> independence. Fair trade relationships provide continuity, during which producers and their marketing organizations can improve their management skills and their access to new markets.
;Payment of a fair price
:A fair price in the regional or local context is one that has been agreed through dialogue and participation. It covers not only the costs of production but enables production which is socially just and environmentally sound. It provides fair pay to the producers and takes into account the principle of equal pay for equal work by women and men. Fairtraders ensure prompt payment to their partners and, whenever possible, help producers with access to pre-harvest or pre-production financing.
;[[Equalism|Gender equity]]
:Fair trade means that women<U+2019>s work is properly valued and rewarded. Women are always paid for their contribution to the production process and are empowered in their organizations.
;Working conditions
:Fair trade means a safe and healthy working environment for producers. The participation of children (if any) does not adversely affect their well-being, security, educational requirements and need for play and conforms to the [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]] as well as the law and norms in the local context.
;[[Environmental protection]]
:Fair trade actively encourages better environmental practices and the application of responsible methods of production.

== General structure of the movement ==
[[Image:Transfair-produktauswahl.jpg|thumb|350px|right|[[Fairtrade certification|Fairtrade certified]] products sold in [[Germany]]]]Most fair trade import organizations are members or certified by one or several national or international federations. These federations coordinate, promote and facilitate the work of fair trade organizations. The following are the largest and most influential:

* The [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]] (FLO), created in [[1997]], is the largest and most widely recognized standard setting and certification body for [[Fairtrade labelling|labelled Fairtrade]]. It regularly inspects and certifies producer organizations in more than 50 countries in [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Latin America]], encompassing approximately one million families of farmers and workers.

* The [[International Fair Trade Association]] (IFAT) is a global association created in 1989 of fairtrade producer cooperatives and associations, export marketing companies, importers, retailers, national and regional fair trade networks and fair trade support organizations. In [[2004]] IFAT launched the FTO Mark which identifies registered Fair Trade Organizations (as opposed to the [[FLO]] system, which labels products). [[International Fair Trade Association|IFAT]] has nearly 300 member organizations in over 60 countries.

* The [[Network of European Worldshops]] (NEWS), created in [[1994]], is the umbrella network of 15 national [[Worldshop]] associations in 13 different countries all over [[Europe]].

* The [[European Fair Trade Association]] (EFTA), created in [[1990]], is a network of European fair trade organisations which import products from some 400 economically disadvantaged producer groups in Africa, Asia and Latin America. EFTA's goal is to promote fair trade and to make fair trade importing more efficient and effective. The organization also published yearly various publications on the evolution of the fair trade market. EFTA currently has eleven members in nine different countries.

In 1998, these four federations created together [[FINE]], an informal association whose goal is to harmonize fair trade standards and guidelines, increase the quality and efficiency of fair trade monitoring systems and advocate fair trade politically.

* [http://www.fairtradefederation.org The Fair Trade Federation] (FTF) is an association of Canadian and American fair trade wholesalers, importers and retailers. The organization links its members to fair trade producer groups while acting as a clearinghouse for information on fair trade and providing resources and networking opportunities to its members.

==History==
{{main|History of fair trade}}
The first attempts to commercialize fair trade goods in Northern markets were initiated in the [[1940s]] and [[1950s]] by religious groups and various politically oriented [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs). [[Ten Thousand Villages]], an NGO within the [[Mennonite Central Committee]] (MCC) and [[SERRV International]] were the first, in [[1946]] and [[1949]] respectively, to develop fair trade supply chains in developing countries.<ref>International Fair Trade Association. (2005).[http://www.ifat.org/fthistory/history3.shtml Crafts and Food]. URL accessed on August 2, 2006.</ref> The products, almost exclusively [[handicrafts]] ranging from [[jute]] goods to [[cross-stitch]] work, were mostly sold in [[Worldshops]]. The goods themselves had often no other function than to indicate that a donation had been made.<ref>Hockerts, K. (2005). [http://www.oikos-foundation.unisg.ch/homepage/fairtrade.pdf The Fair Trade Story]. p1</ref>

===Solidarity trade===
[[Image:Fair Trade Products.jpg|thumb||left|Fair Trade goods sold in Worldshops]]The current fair trade movement was shaped in Europe in the [[1960s]]. Fair trade during that period was often seen as a political gesture against neo-imperialism: radical student movements began targeting multinational corporations and concerns that traditional business models were fundamentally flawed started to emerge. The slogan at the time, <U+201C>Trade not Aid<U+201D>, gained international recognition in 1968 when it was adopted by the [[UNCTAD]] ([[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]]) to put the emphasis on the establishment of fair trade relations with the developing world.<ref>International Fair Trade Association. (2005). [http://www.ifat.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=10&Itemid=17&limit=1&limitstart=1 Where did it all begin?] URL accessed on August 2, 2006.</ref>

The year [[1965]] saw the creation of the first [[Alternative Trading Organization]] (ATO): that year, [[United Kingdom|British]] [[NGO]] [[Oxfam]] launched "Helping-by-Selling", a program which sold imported handicrafts in Oxfam stores in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and from mail-order catalogues.

In [[1969]], the first Worldshop opened its doors in the Netherlands. The initiative aimed at bringing the principles of fair trade to the retail sector by selling almost exclusively goods produced under fair trade terms in <U+201C>underdeveloped regions<U+201D>. The first shop was run by volunteers and was so successful that dozens of similar shops soon went into business in the [[Benelux]] countries, [[Germany]] and in other Western European countries.

Throughout the [[1960s]] and 1970s, important segments of the fair trade movement worked to find markets for products from countries that were excluded from the mainstream trading channels for political reasons. Thousands of volunteers sold coffee from [[Angola]] and [[Nicaragua]] in Worldshops, in the back of churches, from their homes and from stands in public places, using the products as a vehicle to deliver their message: give disadvantaged producers in developing countries a fair chance on the world<U+2019>s market, and you support their self-determined sustainable development. The alternative trade movement blossomed, if not in sales, then at least in terms of dozens of [[Alternative Trading Organization|ATOs]] being established on both sides of the Atlantic, of scores of Worldshops being set up, and of well-organized actions and campaigns attacking exploitation and foreign domination, and promoting the ideals of [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Julius Nyerere]] and the Nicaraguan [[Sandinistas]]: the right to independence and self-determination, to equitable access to the world<U+2019>s markets and consumers.

===Handcrafts vs. agricultural goods===

In the early 1980s, Alternative Trading Organizations faced a major challenge: the novelty of some fair trade products started wearing off, demand reached a plateau and some handicrafts began to look <U+201C>tired and old fashioned<U+201D> in the marketplace.<ref>Redfern A. & Snedker P. (2002) [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf Creating Market Opportunities for Small Enterprises: Experiences of the Fair Trade Movement]. International Labor Office. p6</ref>The decline of segments of the handicrafts market forced fair trade supporters to rethink their business model and their goals. Moreover, fair trade supporters during this period became increasingly worried by the impact of the fall of agricultural [[commodity]] prices on poor producers. Many then believed it was the movement's responsibility to address the issue and to find innovative remedies to react to the ongoing crisis in the industry.

In the subsequent years, fair trade agricultural commodities played an important role in the growth of many [[Alternative Trading Organizations|ATOs]]: successful on the market, they offered a much-needed, renewable source of income for producers and provided Alternative Trading Organizations a perfect alternative to the stagnating handicrafts market. The first fair trade agricultural products were [[tea]] and coffee, quickly followed by dried [[fruits]], cocoa, sugar, [[fruit juices]], [[rice]], [[spices]] and [[nut (fruit)|nuts]]. While in 1992, a sales value ratio of 80 % handcrafts to 20 % agricultural goods was the norm, in 2002 handcrafts amounted to 25.4 % of sales while commodity food lines were up at 69.4 %.<ref>Nicholls, A. & Opal, C. (2004). Fair Trade: Market-Driven Ethical Consumption. London: Sage Publications.</ref>

===Rise of labelling initiatives===
[[Image:Oldftlogos2.jpg|thumb|Early Fairtrade Certifications Marks]]<!-- FAIR USE of Oldftlogos2.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Oldftlogos2.jpg for rationale -->Sales of fair trade products however only really took off with the arrival of the first [[Fairtrade labelling]] initiatives. Although buoyed by ever growing sales, fair trade had been generally contained to relatively small Worldshops scattered across Europe and to a lesser extent, [[North America]]. Some felt that these shops were too disconnected from the rhythm and the lifestyle of contemporary developed societies. The inconvenience of going to them to buy only a product or two was too high even for the most dedicated customers. The only way to increase sale opportunities was to start offering fair trade products where consumers normally shop, in large distribution channels.<ref>Renard, M.-C., (2003). Fair Trade: quality, market and conventions. Journal of Rural Studies, 19, 87-96.</ref> The problem was to find a way to expand distribution without compromising consumer trust in fair trade products and in their origins.

A solution was found in [[1988]], when the first [[Fairtrade certification|Fairtrade labelling]] initiative, [[Stichting Max Havelaar]], was created under the initiative of [[Nico Roozen]], [[Frans Van Der Hoff]] and Dutch development NGO [[Solidaridad]]. The independent certification allowed the goods to be sold outside the Worldshops and into the mainstream, reaching a larger consumer segment and boosting fair trade sales significantly. The [[Fairtrade labelling|labeling initiative]] also allowed customers and distributors alike to track the origin of the goods to confirm that the products were really benefiting the producers at the end of the [[supply chain]].<ref>Redfern A. & Snedker P. (2002) [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf Creating Market Opportunities for Small Enterprises: Experiences of the Fair Trade Movement]. International Labor Office. p7</ref>

The concept caught on: in the ensuing years, similar non-profit Fairtrade labelling organizations were set up in other European countries and North America. In [[1997]], a process of convergence among labelling organizations <U+2013> or <U+201C>LIs<U+201D> (for <U+201C>Labelling Initiatives<U+201D>) <U+2013> led to the creation of [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]]. [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International|FLO]] is an umbrella organization whose mission is to set the Fairtrade standards, support, inspect and certify disadvantaged producers and harmonize the Fairtrade message across the movement.

In [[2002]], [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International|FLO]] launched for the first time an [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]]. The goals of the launch were to improve the visibility of the Mark on supermarket shelves, facilitate cross border trade and simplify procedures for both producers and importers. At present, over 16 FLO International member labelling initiatives use the [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]]. There are now Fairtrade Certification Marks on dozens of different products, based on FLO<U+2019>s certification for coffee, tea, rice, [[banana]]s, [[mangoes]], cocoa, cotton, sugar, [[honey]], [[fruit juices]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[fruit|fresh fruit]], [[quinoa]], [[herbs]] and [[spices]], [[wine]] and [[Football (ball)|footballs ]] etc.

===Fair trade today===
Global fair trade sales have soared over the past decade. The increase has been particularly spectacular among Fairtrade labelled goods: in [[2006]], these sales amounted to approximately <U+20AC>1.6 billion worldwide, a 41 % year-to-year increase.<ref>Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (2007). www.fairtrade.net.

==Fairtrade certification and labelling==
[[Image:Fairtrade.png|thumb|130px|[[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]]]][[Image:TransFair.gif|thumb|125px|[[Fair Trade Certified Mark]] ([[United States|USA]] & [[Canada]])]]<!-- FAIR USE of TransFair.gif: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:TransFair.gif for rationale --> 
[[Image:Ftomark.jpg|thumb|125px|[[International Fair Trade Association|IFAT Fair Trade Organization Mark]]]]<!-- FAIR USE of FTomark.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Ftomark.jpg for rationale -->{{main|Fairtrade certification}}
===Fairtrade Labelling Organizations (FLO) product certification===
''Note: Customary spelling of Fairtrade is one word when referring to the FLO product labelling system''

Fairtrade labelling (usually simply Fairtrade or [[Fair Trade Certified Mark|Fair Trade Certified]] in the [[US]]) is a certification system designed to allow consumers to identify goods which meet agreed standards. Overseen by a standard-setting body ([[FLO International]]) and a certification body ([[FLO-CERT]]), the system involves independent auditing of producers and traders to ensure the agreed standards are met.

For a product to carry either the [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]] or the [[Fair Trade Certified Mark]], it must come from [[FLO-CERT]] inspected and certified producer organizations. The crops must be grown and harvested in accordance with the international Fairtrade standards set by [[FLO International]]. The [[supply chain]] must also have been monitored by [[FLO-CERT]], to ensure the integrity of labelled products.

[[Fairtrade certification]] guarantees not only fair prices, but also the principles of [[ethical purchasing]]. These principles include adherence to [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] agreements such as those banning child and [[slave labour]], guaranteeing a safe workplace and the right to [[unionization|unionise]], adherence to the [[United Nations]] charter of [[human rights]], a fair price that covers the cost of production and facilitates social development, and protection and conservation of the environment. The Fairtrade certification system also promotes long-term business relationships between buyers and sellers, and greater transparency throughout the supply chain.

The [[Fairtrade certification]] system covers a growing range of products, including [[banana]]s, [[honey]], [[coffee]], [[oranges]], [[cocoa]], [[cotton]], dried and fresh fruits and vegetables, juices, nuts and oil seeds, [[quinoa]], [[rice]], [[spices]], [[sugar]], [[tea]] and [[wine]]. Companies offering products that meet the [[Fairtrade]] standards may apply for licences to use one of the Fairtrade Certification Marks for those products.

The [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]] was launched in [[2002]] by [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International|FLO]], and replaced twelve Marks used by various Fairtrade labelling initiatives. The new Certification Mark is currently used worldwide (with the exception of Canada and the United States).

The [[Fair Trade Certified Mark]], used in Canada and in the United States, also still identifies Fairtrade goods in both countries. Full transition to the new Mark should become reality in the future as it gradually replaces the old Certification Marks in both countries.

===IFAT Fair Trade Organization certification===
In an effort to complement the Fairtrade product certification system and allow most notably handcraft producers to also sell their products outside [[worldshops]], the [[International Fair Trade Association]] (IFAT) launched in 2004 a new Mark to identify fair trade organizations (as opposed to products in the case of [[FLO International]] and [[Fairtrade]]). Called the FTO Mark, it allows consumers to recognize registered Fair Trade Organizations worldwide and guarantees that standards are being implemented regarding working conditions, wages, child labour and the environment.

The FTO Mark gave for the first time all Fair Trade Organizations (including [[handcrafts]] producers) definable recognition amongst consumers, existing and new business partners, governments and donors.

==Fair trade impact studies==
Several independent studies have recently measured the impact of fair trade on disadvantaged farmers and workers.

In 2002, Loraine Ronchi of the Poverty Research Unit at the [[University of Sussex]] studied the impact of fair trade on the Coocafe cooperative in [[Costa Rica]]. Ronchi found that fair trade strengthened producer organizations and concluded that "in light of the coffee crisis of the early [[1990s]], fair trade can be said to have accomplished its goal of improving the returns to small producers and positively affecting their quality of life and the health of the organisations that represent them locally, nationally and beyond".<ref>Ronchi, L. (2002). [http://www.fairtrade.net/uploads/media/ronchi_ft_impact_cococafe_costa_rica.pdf The Impact of Fair Trade on Producers and their Organizations: A Case Study with Coocafe in Costa Rica]. University of Sussex. p25-26.</ref>

In 2003, the Fair Trade Research Group at [[Colorado State University]] conducted seven case studies of Latin American Fairtrade coffee producers (UCIRI, CEPCO, Majomut, Las Colinas & El Sincuyo
La Selva, Tzotzilotic and La Voz) and concluded that Fair Trade has "in a short time greatly improved the well-being of small-scale coffee farmers and their families"<ref>Murray D., Raynolds L. & Taylor P. (2003). [http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Sociology/FairTradeResearchGroup/doc/fairtrade.pdf One Cup at a time: Poverty Alleviation and Fair Trade coffee in Latin America]. Colorado State University, p28</ref> The various case studies  most notably found that producers had under Fair Trade greater access to credit and external development funding.<ref>Taylor, Pete Leigh (2002). [http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Sociology/FairTradeResearchGroup/doc/pete.pdf Poverty Alleviation Through Participation in Fair Trade Coffee Networks], Colorado State University, p18.</ref> The studies also found that Fair Trade producers had, compared to conventional coffee producers, greater access to training and enhanced ability to improve the quality of their coffee.<ref>Murray D., Raynolds L. & Taylor P. (2003). [http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Sociology/FairTradeResearchGroup/doc/fairtrade.pdf One Cup at a time: Poverty Alleviation and Fair Trade coffee in Latin America]. Colorado State University, p8</ref>. Families of Fair Trade producers were also said to be more stable and children had better access to education than in families growing conventional coffee.<ref>Murray D., Raynolds L. & Taylor P. (2003). [http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Sociology/FairTradeResearchGroup/doc/fairtrade.pdf One Cup at a time: Poverty Alleviation and Fair Trade coffee in Latin America]. Colorado State University, p10-11</ref>

A case study of Bolivian coffee Fair Trade producers published by Nicolas Eberhart for French NGO [[Agronomes et V<U+00E9>t<U+00E9>rinaires sans fronti<U+00E8>res]] in 2005 concluded that Fair Trade certification has had in the [[Yungas]] a positive impact on local coffee prices, thus economically benefiting all coffee producers (Fairtrade certified or not). Fair Trade was also said to have strengthened producer organizations and increased their political influence.<ref>Eberhart, N. (2005).

An econometric analysis conducted by Becchetti and Costantino (2006) verified the impact of Fair Trade affiliation on monetary and non monetary measures of well-being on a sample of [[Kenya]]n farmers. The researchers compared a [[Experimental control|control sample group]] of farmers to [[Fairtrade certification|Fair trade certified]] groups and Meru herbs farmers. Becchetti and Costantino documented the following: during the same period, Fair trade farmers were more successful in diversifying their production, experienced a significant drop in child mortality, improvements in terms of monthly household food consumption, greater satisfaction in terms of prices obtained for their crop, living conditions etc. Methodological problems such as the relative contribution of Fair Trade and Meru herbs farmers, control sample bias, Fair trade and Meru Herb selection biases are discussed and addressed showing that ex ante selection of Meru members contributes to explain some but not all the results of the study.

==Fair trade and politics==
===European politics===
[[Image:Faitrade display.jpg|thumb|300px|Display of Fairtrade products at the [[Derbyshire County Council]] head office]]
As early as [[1994]], the European Commission prepared the <U+201C>Memo on alternative trade<U+201D> in which it declared its support for strengthening Fair Trade in the South and North and its intention to establish an EC Working Group on Fair Trade. Furthermore, the same year, the [[European Parliament]] adopted the <U+201C>Resolution on promoting fairness and solidarity in North South trade<U+201D> (OJ C 44, 14.2.1994), a resolution voicing its support for fair trade.

In [[1996]], the [[Economic and Social Committee]] adopted an <U+201C>Opinion on the European <U+201C>Fair Trade<U+201D> marking movement<U+201D>. A year later, in [[1997]], the document was followed by a resolution adopted by the European Parliament, calling on the [[European Commission|Commission]] to support Fair Trade [[banana]] operators. The same year, the European Commission published a survey on <U+201C>Attitudes of EU consumers to Fair Trade bananas<U+201D>, concluding that Fair Trade bananas would be commercially viable in several EU Member States.<ref name="FINE2006">FINE (2006). Business Unusual. Brussels: Fair Trade Advocacy Office</ref> 

In [[1998]], the European Parliament adopted the <U+201C>Resolution on Fair Trade<U+201D> (OJ C 226/73, 20.07.1998), which was followed by the European Commission|Commission in [[1999]] that adopted the <U+201C>Communication from the Commission to the Council on <U+201C>Fair Trade<U+201D> COM(1999) 619 final, 29.11.1999.

In [[2000]], public institutions in Europe started purchasing Fairtrade Certified coffee and tea. Furthermore, that year, the [[Cotonou Agreement]] made specific reference to the promotion of Fair Trade in article 23 g) and in the Compendium. The European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/36/EC also suggested promoting Fair Trade.<ref name="FINE2006" />

In [[2001]] and [[2002]], several other EU papers explicitly mentioned fair trade, most notably the [[2001]] Green Paper on [[Corporate Social Responsibility]] and the [[2002]] Communication on Trade and Development.

In [[2004]], the [[European Union]] adopted the <U+201C>Agricultural Commodity Chains, Dependence and Poverty <U+2013> A proposal for an EU Action Plan<U+201D>, with a specific reference to the Fair Trade movement which has <U+201C>been setting the trend for a more socio-economically responsible trade.<U+201D> (COM(2004)0089).

In [[2005]], in the European Commission communication <U+201C>Policy Coherence for Development <U+2013> Accelerating progress towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals<U+201D>, (COM(2005) 134 final, 12.04.2005), Fair Trade is mentioned as <U+201C>a tool for poverty reduction and sustainable development<U+201D>.<ref name="FINE2006" />

And finally, on [[July 6]], [[2006]], the European Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution on Fair Trade, recognizing the benefits achieved by the Fair Trade movement, suggesting the development of an EU-wide policy on Fair Trade, defining criteria that need to be fulfilled under Fair Trade to protect it from abuse and calling for greater support to Fair Trade (EP resolution <U+201C>Fair Trade and development<U+201D>, 6 July 2006)

"This resolution responds to the impressive growth of Fair Trade, showing the increasing interest of European consumers in responsible purchasing," said [[European Green Party|Green]] MEP [[Frithjof Schmidt]] during the plenary debate. [[Peter Mandelson]], EU Commissioner for External Trade, responded that the resolution will be well-received at the [[European Commission|Commission]]. "Fair Trade makes the consumers think and therefore it is even more valuable. We need to develop a coherent policy framework and this resolution will help us."<ref>Frithjof Schmidt MEP (2006).

===French politics===
In [[2005]], [[France|French]] [[French National Assembly|parliament]] member [[Antoine Herth]] issued the report <U+201C>40 proposals to sustain the development of Fair Trade<U+201D>. The report was followed the same year by a law, proposing to establish a Commission to recognize Fair Trade Organisations (article 60 of law no. 2005-882, Small and Medium Enterprises, 2 August 2005).<ref>FINE (2006). Business Unusual. Brussels: Fair Trade Advocacy Office</ref>

In parallel to the legislative developments, also in [[2006]], the [[France|French]] chapter of [[ISO]] (AFNOR) adopted a reference document on Fair Trade after five years of discussion.

===Italian politics===
In [[2006]], [[Italy|Italian]] lawmakers started debating how to introduce a law on fair trade in [[Parliament of Italy|Parliament]]. A consultation process involving a wide range of stakeholders was launched early October.<ref>Nembri, Antonietta (October 4, 2006) [http://www.vita.it/articolo/index.php3?NEWSID=72176 Equo e solidale: un convegno sul futuro normativo.] URL accessed on October 28, 2006.</ref>

In March 2006, First Minister Jack McConnell of the Scottish Parliament pledged that Scotland would become a "Fair Trade Nation". [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2006/07/03112221]

On the 27<sup>th</sup> of January 2007, 150 delegates attended the first Fair Trade Scotland conference held in Perth. The aim of the conference was to create a network of fair trade supporters and set the goals for Scotland becoming a Fair Trade Nation.

== Common justifications for fair trade ==
[[Image:FairtradeRiceIndia.jpg|thumb|350px|Fairtrade Certified [[Rice]] Producer in [[Thailand]]]]Implicit and often explicit in fair trade is a criticism of the current organization of international trade as being "unfair". Fair trade advocates argue in favor of the need for fair trade by mentioning the proported [[microeconomic]] [[market failures]] of the current system and an alleged commodity crisis and its impact on [[developing country]] producers.

===Free trade and market failures===
All [[FINE]] members and fair trade federations support in theory the principles of unhindered [[free trade]]. However, as [[Alex Nicholls (academic)|Alex Nicholls]], social entrepreneurship professor at [[Oxford University]], states, the "key conditions on which [[Classical liberalism|classical]] and [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal]] trade theories are based are notably absent in [[rural]] agricultural societies in many [[developing country|developing countries]]."<ref name="Nicholls2004">Nicholls, A. & Opal, C. (2004). Fair Trade: Market-Driven Ethical Consumption. London: Sage Publications. p17-19</ref> Perfect market information, perfect access to markets and [[credit]], and the ability to switch production techniques and outputs in response to market information are fundamental assumptions which "are fallacious in the context of agricultural producers and workers in developing countries".<ref name="Nicholls2004" />

According to Fair trade proponents, the absence of these microeconomic conditions can nullify or even reverse the potential gains to producers from [[trade]]. While [[Alex Nicholls (academic)|Nicholls]] agrees that the win-win situation for all actors involved may be broadly correct in some markets, nevertheless, "within developing countries market conditions are not such that producers can unambiguously be declared to be better off through trade."<ref name="Nicholls2004" /> The existence of these [[market failure]]s lessens the capacity trade has to lift developing countries out of [[poverty]].

Fair trade is seen as an attempt to address these proported market failures by providing producers a stable price for their crop, business support, access to premium Northern markets and better general trading conditions.

===The commodity crisis===
Fair trade advocates also often point out that unregulated competition in global commodity markets ever since the [[1970s]] and [[1980s]] has encouraged a price "[[race to the bottom]]". During the [[1970]]-[[2000]] period, prices for many of the main agricultural exports of developing countries, such as [[sugar]], [[cotton]], [[cocoa]] and [[coffee]], fell by 30 to 60 percent.<ref>Agricultural Commodity Chains, Dependence and Poverty. A proposal for an EU Action Plan. European Commission, 2004.</ref> According to the [[European Commission]], <U+201C>the abandonment of international [[Economic interventionism|intervention policies]] at the end of the 1980s and the commodity market reforms of the [[1990s]] in the developing countries left the commodity sectors, and in particular small producers, largely to themselves in their struggle with the demands of the markets<U+201D>. Today, <U+201C>producers<U+2026> live an unpredictable existence because the prices for a wide range of commodities are very volatile and in addition follow a declining long-term trend<U+201D>.<ref>Agricultural Commodity Chains, Dependence and Poverty. A proposal for an EU Action Plan. European Commission, 2004.</ref> The total loss for developing countries due to falling commodity prices has been estimated by the [[Food and Agricultural Organisation]] (FAO) to total almost $250 billion during the [[1980]]-[[2002]] period.<ref name="FINE2006" />

Millions of poor farmers are dependent on commodities and on the price they receive for their [[harvest]]. In about 50 developing countries, three or fewer primary commodity exports constitute the bulk of export revenue.

Many farmers, often without other means of subsistence, are obliged to produce more and more, no matter how low the prices are. Research has shown that those who suffer most from declines in commodity prices are the rural poor <U+2014> i.e. the majority of people living in developing countries. Basic [[agriculture]] employs over 50% of the people in developing countries, and accounts for 33% of their GDP.<ref>UNCTAD Press Release, <U+201C>UNCTAD Calls For Policy Changes to Avoid Throwing World Economy Into Recession,<U+201D> 25 August 1998.</ref>

Fair trade supporters believe current market prices do not properly reflect the true costs associated with production; they believe only a well-managed stable minimum price system can cover environmental and [[social cost|social]] production costs.

== Criticism ==
{{main|Fair trade debate}}
Fair trade's increasing popularity has drawn criticism from both ends of the [[political spectrum]]. Different arguments are used by those who favour and by those who oppose fair trade, or feel that more strict standards and higher fair trade prices are needed. These arguments can be divided into four broad categories: 
*The '''price distortion''' argument, advocated by the [[Adam Smith Institute]],<ref>Singleton, A: "The poverty of fair trade.", Adam Smith Institute, 2005</ref> and [[The Economist]] magazine<ref name="economist">The Economist. (Dec 7th 2006). [http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8380592 Voting with your trolley] URL accessed on 31 December 2006.</ref> calling fair trade a "misguided attempt to make up for market failures" encouraging market inefficiencies and overproduction.<ref>Brink, Lindsey. (2004). [http://www.adamsmith.org/pdf/groundsforcomplaint.pdf Grounds for Complaint]. URL accessed on September 25, 2006.</ref>
*The '''creation of insider/outsider markets''' argument, defended by the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]]<ref>Booth, P. and L. Whetstone (2007). [http://www.iea.org.uk/record.jsp?type=book&ID=408]. Also to be published in Economic Affairs, Volume 27, No. 2, June 2007.</ref>. This argument does not explicitly criticize the ideals behind fair trade, but rather current certification, production and pricing systems.
*The '''trade justice''' argument, championed by French author and broadcaster [[Jean-Pierre Boris]]<ref>Boris, Jean-Pierre (2005). [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Booksources&isbn=2012357814 Commerce in<U+00E9>quitable: Le roman noir des mati<U+00E8>res premi<U+00E8>res]. Paris: Hachette Litt<U+00E9>ratures.</ref> criticizing fair trade for stopping short of actively advocating immediate trade policy changes that would have a larger impact on disadvantaged producers' lives.
*The '''mainstreaming argument''', defended by French author Christian Jacquiau, which criticizes the largest part of the fair trade movement for working within the current system (i.e. partnerships with mass retailers, [[multinational corporation]]s etc.) rather than establishing a fairer and fully autonomous trading system.

=== Price distortion argument ===
[[Image:Price floor eqm.png|right|thumb|200px|Effects of a Price Floor]]

Similar to other [[farm subsidies]], fair trade attempts to set a [[price floor]] for a good that is in many cases above the [[market price]] and therefore encourages existing producers to produce more and new producers to enter the market, leading to excess supply. Through the laws of [[supply and demand]], excess supply can lead to lower prices in the non Fair Trade market.

While critics of Fair Trade usually recognize the idea was based on "the best of intentions", it might in fact, "makes things worse".<ref>Singleton, A: "The poverty of fair trade.", Adam Smith Institute, 2005</ref>  Singleton's comments echo the main criticisms of Fair Trade, that "it also leads fair trade producers to increase production. While benefiting a number of Fair Trade producers over the short run, fair trade critics worry about the impact on long run development and economic growth.
The reason coffee prices are so low on the world markets is that there is too much production. By encouraging even more supply of coffee, fair trade makes the world price fall further. This makes the vast majority of coffee producers worse off. It also focuses us away from dealing with the real, long term solutions." Though the adjustment progress is difficult, this creative destruction is a core component of economic growth. By stopping price signals, fair trade may encourage inefficient activities that will not lift the world's poor out of poverty over the long run. In [[2003]], [[Cato Institute]] senior fellow [[Brink Lindsey]] referred to fair trade as a <U+201C>well intentioned, [[Economic interventionism|interventionist]] scheme...doomed to end in failure." Fair trade, according to Lindsey, is a misguided attempt to make up for [[market failures]] in which one flawed pricing structure is replaced with another.<ref>Brink, Lindsey. (2004). [http://www.adamsmith.org/pdf/groundsforcomplaint.pdf Grounds for Complaint]. URL accessed on September 25, 2006.</ref>

The price distortion argument however is far from unanimous among academics: according to Becchetti and Rosati (2006), there are two fallacies behind this kind of reasoning. 

#First, in many cases the exchange between producers and intermediaries does not occur in a competitive framework. In such case the market price is a distortion because it does not reflect the productivity of producers but their lower market power. 
#Second, the food industry produces highly differentiated products with a continuous wave of innovations which create new varieties. There is not one single coffee but instead many different coffee products which are differentiated from one another in terms of quality, blends, packaging, and now also "social responsibility" features. For each of these products there exists a specific and different market price which is determined by consumer taste for that kind of product (which for fair trade coffees does not seem to be weak or declining){{Fact|date=May 2007}}. In this sense, fair trade is an innovation in the food industry which creates a new range of products.<ref name="Becchetti">L.Becchetti F.C. Rosati, 2006, [http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/rtvceiswp/209.htm Globalisation and the death of distance in social preferences ad inequity aversion: empirical evidence from a pilot study on fair trade consumers, CEIS Working Paper, n.216 and World Economy (forth.)]</ref> 

Beyond these elements it is important to also take into account all the potential benefits of the fair trade value chain in terms of provision of local public goods, technical assistance which strengthens producers market capabilities, democratization of markets through increasing consumer power etc.<ref name="Becchetti"/>

Fair trade organizations such as [[FLO International]] also respond to the oversupply argument by claiming that fair trade is very much a market-responsive model of trade: the farmers receive the Fairtrade minimum prices and premiums only if they have a buyer willing to pay them and many producer groups also sell in the conventional market. According to Luuk Zonneveld, Managing Director at FLO International, "our experience is that producers use their additional income from Fairtrade to improve their homes, send their children to school and improve the quality of their existing crop, rather than to increase production".<ref>''The Economist'' (January 11, 2007) [http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8515834 Letters to the Editor] URL accessed on January 12, 2007</ref> Fair trade organizations have also long encouraged producers to invest in diversification and specialty crop development programs. Examples include coffee growers developing citrus or macadamia nuts, banana farmers moving into other premium tropical produce, or investment in alternative income-generation projects such as eco-tourism, or in community health and education programs.<ref>FLO International. (2006) [http://www.fairtrade.net/single_view.html?&tx_ttnews[tt_news]=11&tx_ttnews[backPid]=104&cHash=ccfcb32023 Response to ''The Economist''] URL accessed on January 4, 2007</ref>

=== Mainstreaming argument ===
On the other end of the spectrum, some believe a large part of the fair trade system is not radical enough. [[France|French]] author [[Christian Jacquiau]], in his book ''Les coulisses du commerce <U+00E9>quitable'', calls for stricter fair trade standards and criticizes a segment of the fair trade movement, especially [[Association Max Havelaar France|Max Havelaar France]], for working within the current system (i.e. partnerships with mass retailers, [[multinational corporation]]s etc.) rather than establishing a new fairer, fully autonomous trading system. Jacquiau is also a staunch supporter of significantly higher fair trade prices in order to maximize the impact, as most producers only sell a portion of their crop under fair trade terms. He defends in his book a minority of fair trade networks (such as ''Minga'' or ''Artisans du monde'' in France) that he believes have higher ethical value<ref>Jacquiau, Christian (2006). Les Coulisses du Commerce <U+00C9>quitable. <U+00C9>ditions Mille et Une Nuits. Paris.</ref>.

Another French author, Virginie Diaz Pedregal, presents some philosophical theories regarding domestic and international justice to explain fair trade movements. Without taking personal part in the debate, the author exposes her thesis about the reasons underlying dissensions between groups practicing fair trade. The standpoint is that its stakeholders refer to divergent justice principles arising from dissimilar and hardly compatible social ideals.<ref>Diaz Pedregal, Virginie. (2007). Le Commerce Equitable Dans la France Contemporaine. Id<U+00E9>ologies et Pratiques. Paris: L'Harmattan.</ref>
