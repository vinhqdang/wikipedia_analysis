'''Kato traditional narratives''' include myths, legends, tales, and oral histories preserved by the [[Kato (tribe)|Kato (Cahto)]]  people of the Eel River basin of northwestern California.

Kato oral literature has been classified primarily with that of the central California region, but with evident influences from the Northwest Coast and, more tenuously, from the Plateau region. (''See also'' [[Traditional narratives (Native California)]].)
