The '''Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department''' ('''LASD''') is a local law enforcement agency that serves [[Los Angeles County, California]]. It is the largest [[Sheriff]] department in the [[United States]] and provides general-service law enforcement to unincorporated areas of [[Los Angeles County]], serving as the equivalent of the [[county police]] for unincorporated areas of the county as well as [[incorporation (municipal government)|incorporated]] cities within the county who have contracted with the agency for law-enforcement services (known as "[[contract city|contract cities]]" in local jargon). It also holds primary jurisdiction over facilities operated by Los Angeles County, such as local parks, marinas and government buildings; provides [[marshal]] service for the [[Superior Courts of California|Superior Court of California - County of Los Angeles]]; operates the [[county jail]] system; and provides services such as laboratories and academy training to smaller law enforcement agencies within the county. The '''Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department''' ('''LASD''') is sometimes referred to as the '''Los Angeles Sheriff's Office''' ('''LASO'''). 

On [[March 10]], [[2007]], actor [[Jackie Chan]] has joined forces with the LA County Sheriff's Department in their current recruitment campaign in encouraging the Asian community to be a deputy sheriff. In the announcement with Sheriff [[Lee Baca]], Chan was seen wearing an LA County Sheriff's Deputy uniform.[http://lasdshb.wordpress.com/2007/03/09/sheriff-baca-and-actor-jackie-chan-join-forces-to-recruit-crime-fighters/] [http://cbs2.com/local/local_story_070031643.html] [http://www.knx1070.com/content_page.php?contentType=4&contentId=368628]. An LASD [[public service announcement]] will feature Chan.

==Statistics==
The LASD is the largest [[sheriff]]'s department and the fourth largest state or local law enforcement agency in the [[United States]] with over 16,000 employees, over 8,400 of whom are sworn deputies. [[Leroy D. Baca]] is the current sheriff.

LASD deputies provided law enforcement services to 2,557,754 residents in an area of 3,171 square miles both in the [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] County land and within the contract cities (1995 figure).  

The Sheriff's Department also operates one the largest jail systems which provides short-term incarceration services for all of the County (including the cities like [[Los Angeles]] which have their own police departments). The [[Men's Central Jail]] (MCJ) and [[Twin Towers Correctional Facility]] (TTCF) are located in a dense cluster northeast of [[Los Angeles Union Station|Union Station]] that is next to the station's rail yard. The [[North County Correctional Facility]] (NCCF) is the largest of the four jail facilities located at the [[Pitchess Detention Center]] in [[Castaic, California]]. The other facilities are East Facility, North Facility, and South Facility. 

Some of the newer contract cities like [[Santa Clarita, California|Santa Clarita]] and [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]] have never had police departments. When their city governments were founded, they took over what was formerly unincorporated land, but then contracted their police responsibilities right back to the county sheriff. Since the sheriff already had substations in those areas anyway, the result was to maintain the status quo.  

In contrast, [[Compton, California]], used to have a police department, but in 2000 the city council voted to dismantle the police department and become a contract city. Compton has been at times notorious for [[gang]] violence.

LA County Sheriff's academy training is at Sheriffs Training Academy and Regional Services Center (STARS Center) in [[Whittier, California|Whittier]]. Reserves may use either STARS Center or [[College of the Canyons]] (Santa Clarita) for academy training. Academy training is 18 weeks. Many law enforcement agencies throughout Los Angeles County utilize STARS Center and deputy sheriff trainees graduating as deputy sheriffs also undergo detention-specific training.

==Achievements==
The LASD has gained an international reputation for its efforts in developing and integrating the latest law enforcement technologies, especially nonlethal weapons. Because many developers, especially those developing technologies for the U.S. Department of Defense, have little idea of the needs of domestic law enforcement, the LASD provides experts to assist in the development and implementation of technologies that will be of service to law enforcment when fully mature. In the late 1990's the LASD successfully implemented a county-wide sound recorder/meter system, ShotStopper, to detect loud noises.<ref>Cuza, Bobby. "Gadgets on Patrol Against Crime." ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' 9 June 2000: B2.</ref> When dispatch has a call from a citizen reporting possible gunfire near their residence, these sound towers can pinpoint within about 25 to 30 feet where the shots were coming from and record the sound for investigative purposes, and at the same time, relay the GPS info to HQ and deputies on the street. The system is up and running and has already been responsible for the arrest of a felony shooting suspect.

Currently the LASD is working with the Federal Aeronautics Administration and local government officials to deploy their remote control aerial surveillance drone system. This would allow the Sheriff's Department to have real time imagery from the streets of Los Angeles to combat street violence and record crimes in progress, not to mention searching for missing hikers, "patrolling" behind the surf zones of the beaches and looking for lost children. The drones are not intended to replace police helicopters, but in specific incidents could be better, cheaper and quieter to use.

The LASD hired the first female deputy sheriff in the United States in 1912.  [[Margaret Q. Adams]] remained a deputy in the evidence department at the Los Angeles Couthouse for 35 years until her retirement in 1947.

The LASD is also known for having some of the sharpest cops around, especially in the Special Enforcement Bureau, which houses the famous Special Weapons Team or their version of [[SWAT]], a creation of their brothers at [[LAPD]]. Both LAPD and LA Sheriff SWAT teams are thought highly around the globe. SEB SWAT has even helped the US Defense Department in the early 90's by training US special forces on policing skills prior to going overseas. Swat teams from all around the world look to SEB for training and advice. Before conflicts like Bosnia and Kosovo came up, US special forces wanted to be able to enter that very scenario as specialized [[peacekeepers]]. Modern tactics of dynamic entries with large firepower was thought to be too much and would conflict the situation further. The idea was to control a scene,take people into custody, and at the same time keep the peace.

In 1992 after the King riots in LA proper, both the LAPD and LASD SWAT teams decided to work on tactics that would rescue people from dangerous crowds and at the same time provide a way to eliminate a threat such as a gunman without being noticed. In the first example, the idea was to have SWAT ride in one of the departments AIR Rescue units with LASD paramedics to enter a scene by using SWAT as a threat to ground opposition while Medics could safely drop in and pick up an injured person. In the second example, sharpshooters could be used at high altitudes in the air units to look for threats on the ground and at the same time strike would-be killers.

-Discovery Channel circa 2000

The LASD Air Rescue program is used for many emergencies in LA county. Angeles Forest, especially. Those who are trapped in LA in a place they think no one will find them will usually be found and rescued by this team. The LASD staffs multiple sea King helicopters for this program.

In addition to having a fleet of [[Sikorsky Sea King]]s, the model of helicopter used by the [[President of the United States]] as [[Marine One]], the LASD also use [[Eurocopter Ecureuil|A-stars]] and [[NOTAR|Hughes NOTAR]] helicopters. Those models are used primarily as the patrol air units.

==Fallen members==
 	
As of 2007, 96 members died on duty since the department's founding.

===David March===
	 
The most notable fallen member of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department was Deputy David W. March, who was killed by illegal Mexican immigrant Armando Garcia.
	 
On [[April 29]], [[2002]] in [[Irwindale]], Deputy March pulled over a 1989 [[Nissan Maxima]] driven by Garcia. After Deputy March attempted to frisk Garcia, Garcia pulled out a gun, fatally shooting Deputy March execution style. Garcia fled to Mexico within hours after the shooting.
	 
This led to tense negotiations with U.S. and Mexican authorities, mostly about the death penalty. Under a treaty between the United States and Mexico, Mexico will refuse to extradite any fugitive who faces the death penalty. This led to Sheriff [[Lee Baca]] visiting Mexico City to negotiate with Mexican authorities to extradite Garcia. Mexico also refused to extradite fugitives who faced life in prison until 2004 when Mexico's highest court overturned the extradition policy.
	 
Garcia was captured near [[Guadalajara, Jalisco]] in Mexico by U.S. and Mexican authorities. He fought extradition for months and was extradited back to the U.S. in January 2007. He pleaded guilty and was sentence to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
	 
The [[Interstate 210 (California)|I-210]]/[[I-605]] interchange in [[Duarte, California|Duarte]] was named in honor of Deputy March and a sign there reads "Deputy David W. March, Los Angeles County Sheriff Memorial Interchange."

As a result of this case, Congressman [[David Dreier]], working with fellow Congressman [[Adam Schiff]] and Sheriff [[Lee Baca]], introduced legislation that would make it a federal crime for any suspect who murders a public safety official and flees the United States. Three attempts have failed in committee and on [[February 22]], [[2007]], Congressman Dreier introduced such legislation for a fourth time.

In honor of Deputy David March, the Department adopted this creed: "My goals are simple, I will always be painfully honest, work as hard as I can, learn as much as I can and hopefully make a difference in people<U+2019>s lives." Deputy David W. March (EOW: [[April 29]], [[2002]])

===Raul Da Gama===

On [[May 1]], [[2007]], Deputy Raul Da Gama was killed in an accident involving a teenage driver. The driver was charged with [[manslaughter]]. The officer was on a stakeout and at first it was thought the teen driver had hit a parked car. Unfortunately, it was later discovered there was someone in the parked car, Deputy Da Gama. This delay might have played a role in the death of the officer. This was a terrible tragedy for the families of both the officer and the teen driver who was on his way to school at the time of the accident. Coincidentally, Deputy Gama died exactly 20 years after completing the academy.

==Reserve Program==
The [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] supplements its full time ranks with over 700 '''reserve deputies'''.

Like Full-time Deputies, Reserve Deputies are professionally trained and duly sworn [[law enforcement]] personnel. In most cases, Reserves are assigned to the same duties as Full-time Deputies. Since Reserve Deputies have the same powers of [[arrest]] as Full-time Deputies they are required by law to meet the same hiring, background, medical and psychological standards as Full-time Deputies. Reserve Deputy Sheriffs enjoy the challenge and excitement offered by law enforcement, as well as the satisfaction of providing a worthwhile community service. Reserve Deputy Sheriffs first complete the extensive state mandated training and then work assignments on evenings and/or weekends as their regular jobs permit. Reserve Deputy Sheriffs are issued a badge, an identification card, uniforms, a [[Beretta 92FS]] duty weapon, [[handcuffs]], [[Club (weapon)|baton]], and most other necessary equipment. Reserve Deputy Sheriffs have full peace officer powers when on duty, and, if issued a [[concealed carry (USA)|CCW permit]], may choose to carry a concealed weapon when off duty. Reserve Deputy Sheriffs volunteer 20 hours per month of their time with the regular compensation being one dollar per year. Reserve Deputy Sheriffs may also qualify for shooting bonus pay of up to $32.00 per month, and some paid special event assignments are occasionally available. Reserve Deputy Sheriffs serve at the will of the Sheriff, must obey all Departmental regulations, but do not fall into the framework of the civil service system. Reserve Deputy Sheriffs supplement the regular operations of the Sheriff's Department by working in their choice of Uniform Reserve (Patrol), Mounted Posse, Search and Rescue or as a Specialist.

==Television shows based on LASD==
In the late 1950's, a short lived "[[Dragnet (drama)]]"-style [[television series]], "Code 3", aired based on real cases (though names and locations were changed) from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The late [[Eugene Biscailuz]], then [[Sheriff]] of [[Los Angeles County]], was featured in a cameo tag line at the end of every episode. 

The department's Emergency Services Detail (ESD) which functions under the unbrella of the Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB) was depicted in the short lived [[television series]], ''[[240-Robert]]''. The SEB also includes the Canine Services Detail (K-9), and the Special Enforcement Detail (SED) which is the department's special weapons team.

In September 2003, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] premiered ''[[10-8: Officers on Duty]]'' a prime time drama (with a light comedy twist) based on a rookie with the [[Los Angeles Sheriff's Department]]. The show lasted one season. The show's name was based on the police radio code for "on duty".
