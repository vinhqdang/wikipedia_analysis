The '''City & South London Railway''' (C&SLR) is considered to be the first deep-level underground "tube" [[railway]] in the world,<ref name=first>Wolmar, Christian, p 4</ref> and also the first major railway in the world to use electric traction.<ref name=SubRail_01/> When first opened in 1890, it served six stations and ran for a distance of {{convert|5.1|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=on|1}}<ref name=dist>Length of line calculated from distances given at [http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/northern.html#layout Clive's Underground Line Guides - Northern Line, Layout]. Retrieved on [[20 September]] [[2007]].</ref> in a pair of tunnels between the [[City of London]] and [[Stockwell]], passing under the [[River Thames]]. The diameter of the tunnels restricted the size of the trains and the small carriages with their high backed seating were nicknamed ''"[[padded cell]]s"''.<ref name=padded_1>

The railway was extended a number of times; eventually serving 22 stations over a distance of {{convert|21.7|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=on|1}} from [[Camden Town]] in north London to [[Morden]] in [[Surrey]].<ref name=dist/> 

In 1913, the C&SLR became part of the ''[[Underground Electric Railways Company|Underground Group]]'' of railways and, in the [[1920s]], it underwent major reconstruction works prior to its merger with another of the Group's railways. In 1933, the C&SLR and the rest of the Underground Group was taken into [[public ownership]]. Today its tunnels and stations form the [[Northern Line#Morden branch|Morden]] and [[Northern Line#Bank branch|Bank]] branches of the [[London Underground]]'s [[Northern Line]].

==Establishment==
[[Image:C&SLR Arms.png|thumb|150px|Arms of the City & South London Railway]]
In November 1883, notice was given that a [[private bill]] was to be presented to [[parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]] for the construction of the '''City of London & Southwark Subway''' (CL&SS).<ref name=Gazette_01>
{{LondonGazette
|date=27 November 1883
|issue=25291
|startpage=6066
|endpage=6067
|accessdate=2007-09-20}}</ref> The promoter of the bill and engineer of the proposed railway was [[James Henry Greathead]] who had, in 1869-1870, constructed the [[Tower Subway]] using the same [[tunnelling shield]]/segmented [[cast iron]] tube method proposed for the CL&SS. The railway was to run north from [[Elephant and Castle]], in [[Southwark]], south London, under the [[River Thames]] to [[King William Street (London)|King William Street]] in the [[City of London]]. The tracks were to be placed in twin tunnels 10 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] 2 [[inch|in]] (3.1 [[metre|m]]) in diameter.<ref name=Lost_Tubes>Badsey-Ellis, Anthony, p. 35 </ref>

The bill received [[Royal Assent]] as the ''City of London and Southwark Subway Act, 1884'' on [[28 July]] [[1884]].<ref name=Gazette_02>
{{LondonGazette

==Haulage and infrastructure==
[[Image:Ltmd-c&slr-number13-01.jpg|thumb|left|250px|C&SLR locomotive number 13 at [[London's Transport Museum]] Depot in 2005]]
Like Greathead's earlier Tower Subway, the CL&SS was originally intended to be operated by cable haulage with a static engine pulling the cable through the tunnels at a steady speed.<ref name=Lost_Tubes_x> Badsey-Ellis, Anthony, p. 36</ref> Section 5 of the 1884 Act specified that:<br/>
:''"The traffic of the subway shall be worked by...the system of the Patent Cable Tramway Corporation Limited or by such means other than steam locomotives as the Board of Trade may from time to time approve."''<br/>
Trains were to be attached to the cable with clamps. These would be opened and closed at stations allowing the carriages to disconnect and reconnect without needing to stop the cable or interfere with the progress of other trains sharing the cable.<ref name=SubRail_01>
Wolmar, Christian, p 135</ref> The additional lengths of tunnels permitted by the supplementary acts challenged the practicality of a cable hauled system and before the problems could be resolved the cable contractor went out of business.<ref name=Lost_Tubes/> Given the small dimension of the tunnels, steam power, used on London's other underground railways, was not feasible and the solution adopted was electrical power provided via a [[third rail]] beneath the train.<ref name=SubRail_01/> Although, the use of electricity to power trains had been experimented with in the previous decade and small scale operations had been implemented, the C&SLR was the first major railway in the world to adopt it as a means of motive power.<ref name=SubRail_01/> The system operated using [[London Underground electric locomotives#City & South London Railway|electric locomotives]] built by Mather & Platt collecting a [[electric current|current]] at 500 [[volt]]s from the third rail and pulling a number of carriages.<ref name=CULG_01>[http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/northern.html#history Clive's Underground Line Guides - Northern Line, History]. Retrieved on [[20 September]] [[2007]].</ref> A depot and [[power station|generating station]] were constructed at Stockwell.<ref name=depot>The depot and generating station were on the east side of Clapham Road/Kennington Park Road located approximately where Stockwell Gardens is today - As shown on Greathead's plan presented to the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]].</ref> The limited capacity of the generators meant that the stations were originally illuminated by [[gas lighting|gas]].<ref name=SubRail_03> Wolmar, Christian, p 137</ref> The depot was on the surface and trains requiring maintenance were initially hauled to the surface via a ramp but a [[elevator|lift]] was soon installed.<ref name=SubRail_02>Wolmar, Christian, p 134</ref> In practice, most rolling stock and locomotives only went to the surface for major maintenance. 

To avoid the need to purchase agreements for running under surface buildings, the tunnels were bored below roadways where construction could be carried out without charge.<ref name=Lost_Tubes/> At the northern end of the railway, the need to pass deep beneath the bed of the River Thames and the [[middle ages|mediaeval]] street pattern of the City of London constrained the arrangement of the tunnels on the approach to King William Street station. Due to the proximity of the station to the river, steeply inclined tunnels were required to the west of the station. Because of the narrow street under which they ran, they were bored one above the other rather than side by side as elsewhere<ref name=Lost_Tubes/>. The outbound tunnel was the lower and steeper of the two. The tracks came together as a single line immediately before the station which contained a single platform in one large tunnel. The other terminus at Stockwell was also constructed in a single tunnel but with the tracks each side of a central platform.<ref name=Stockwell> The station was rebuilt in the conventional way with separate tunnels for each platform in the 1920s. The new platforms were placed south of the original and were constructed by enlarging the running tunnels <U+2013> Connor, J.E, p. 118.</ref>

==Opening==
The railway was opened officially by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]] (later Edward VII) on [[4 November]] [[1890]].<ref name=Index>[http://www.berga.nu/Lennart_T/lu/1890s.html Index of Underground History - 1890s]. Retrieved on [[20 September]] [[2007]].</ref> The railway was opened to the public on [[18 December]] [[1890]].<ref name=CULG_02>[http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/northern.html#dates Clive's Underground Line Guides - Northern Line, Dates]. Retrieved on [[20 September]] [[2007]].</ref> Initially, it had stations at:
*[[Stockwell tube station|Stockwell]]
*[[Oval tube station|The Oval]] (renamed Oval around 1894)<ref name=DRose>Rose, Douglas</ref>
*[[Kennington tube station|Kennington]]
*[[Elephant & Castle tube station|Elephant & Castle]]
*[[Borough tube station|Borough]]
*[[King William Street tube station|King William Street]]

The original service was operated by trains composed of an engine and three carriages. Thirty two passengers could be accommodated in each carriage<ref name=SubRail_03/> which was provided with longitudinal bench seating and sliding doors at the ends, leading onto a platform from which they could board and alight. It was reasoned that there was nothing to look at in the tunnels so the only windows were in a narrow band high up in the carriage sides. Gate-men rode on the carriage platforms to operate the lattice gates and announce the station names to the passengers. Due to their [[claustrophobia|claustrophobic]] interiors, the carriages soon became known as "padded cells". Unlike other railways, there were no ticket classes; at opening, a single flat fare of two [[British one penny coin (pre-decimal)|pence]], collected at a turnstile, was charged for all passengers.<ref name=SubRail_03/>

==Extensions to Clapham and Islington, 1890 &ndash; 1901==
Shortly before it opened to the public, the C&SLR gave notice of its intention to submit another private bill to parliament - this time to construct a new line from its northern terminus at King William Street towards [[Islington]].<ref name=Gazette_07>
{{LondonGazette

|issue=26109
|startpage=6519

|accessdate=2007-09-20}}
</ref> Due to the awkward arrangement of King William Street station, the extension was not to be connected directly to the existing running tunnels but was to be linked via a pedestrian subway through which passengers could make interchanges between the separate lines. The bill was rejected on the grounds that the extension failed to make a connection to the existing line.<ref name=Lost_Tubes_02> Badsey-Ellis, Anthony, p. 48 </ref> In November 1891, the C&SLR published details of a revised bill for the extension to Islington.<ref name=Gazette_08>

</ref> The company had recognised the deficiencies of its King William Street station and, just a year after the line had opened, planned to construct a new pair of tunnels to bypass the problematic northern section. 

From near Borough station, the new tunnels would branch off and follow a new route via a new station to form an interchange with [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]] mainline station. The tunnels would then pass to the east of [[London Bridge]], then north through the City of London to [[The Angel, Islington]]. Following a delay during which a [[Joint committee|Joint Select Committee]] reviewed the proposals of a number of new underground railways,<ref name=Lost_Tubes_03> Badsey-Ellis, Anthony, p. 68</ref> the ''City and South London Railway Act, 1893'' was approved and received Royal Assent on [[24 August]] [[1893]].<ref name=Gazette_09>

Construction of the two authorised extensions was delayed whilst funds were raised and plans were finalised. Between 1895 and 1898, three further bills were put before parliament to keep the permissions alive and obtain additional approvals:

[[Image:Clapham Common Tube Station Platforms - Oct 2007.jpg|thumb|300px|The narrow central platform at Clapham Common with tracks on both sides dates from the 1900 extension.]]
The new tunnels permitted by the 1895 Act enabled the track layout at King William Street station to be modified to a single central platform with a track each side. This was opened as a temporary measure whilst funds for the extensions were raised. Finance was eventually obtained and construction proceeded so that the King William Street section closed and the first section of the northern extension opened on [[25 February]] [[1900]],<ref name=CULG_02/> with stations at:
*[[London Bridge station|London Bridge]]
*[[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]]

*[[Clapham Common tube station|Clapham Common]]

Like the original Stockwell station and the rearranged King William Street station, Clapham Road and Clapham Common stations were constructed with a single station tunnel in which a central platform was served by tracks on each side.<ref name=tunnel>The C&SLR stations at Angel and Euston were also originally constructed with a single central platform.

Despite the technical innovations of the railway and the large passenger demand,<ref name=SubRail_04>Wolmar, Christian, p 140</ref> the C&SLR was not particularly profitable and the rapid series of extensions undertaken by the company aimed at improving profits had placed a strain on the finances.

</ref> albeit one that shared its chairman with the C&SLR.<ref name=Lost_Tubes_07>Charles Mott acted as Chairman for the C&SLR and the I&ER - Badsey-Ellis, Anthony, p. 96</ref> The proposed railway was to run from the, as yet unfinished, C&SLR station at Angel to the mainline stations at [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]], [[St Pancras railway station|St. Pancras]] and [[Euston railway station|Euston]]. The I&ER bill coincided with a rash of other railway bills encouraged by the successful opening of the [[Central Line|Central London Railway]] (CLR) in 1900 and was considered alongside these by another parliamentary Joint Committee in 1901. The bill was approved,<ref name=Lost_Tubes_08>Badsey-Ellis, Anthony, p. 110 </ref> but the time taken for the committee's review meant that it had to be resubmitted for the 1902 parliamentary session.<ref name=Lost_Tubes_09> Badsey-Ellis, Anthony, p. 111 </ref>

In the 1902 session, the bill was considered again but was subject to opposition from one of London's other underground railways, the [[Metropolitan and Metropolitan District Railways#Metropolitan Railway|Metropolitan Railway]] (MR), which considered the proposed extension to be a threat to its service between King's Cross and Moorgate. The I&ER also submitted a petition to allow the C&SLR to take over the powers of the railway if approved.<ref name=Gazette_20>

==Cooperation and consolidation, 1907 &ndash; 1919 ==
By 1907, Londoners had seen the network of deep tube underground railways expand from the original C&SLR line of 1890 with its six stations to a network of seven lines serving more than seventy stations.<ref name=line_list>In order of opening, the seven lines were: 1. C&SLR (1890), 2. [[Waterloo & City Line|Waterloo & City Railway]] (1898), 3. [[Central Line|Central London Railway]] (1900), 4. [[Northern City Line|Great Northern & City Railway]] (1904), 5. [[Bakerloo Line|Baker Street & Waterloo Railway]] (1906), 6. [[Piccadilly Line|Great Northern, Piccadilly & Brompton Railway]] (1906) and 7. [[Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway]] (1907).</ref> These companies, along with the sub-surface Metropolitan Railway and Metropolitan District Railway, criss-crossed beneath the city streets, competing with one another for passengers as well as with the new [[tram|electric trams]] and [[bus|motor buses]]. In a number of cases pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers had proven to be over optimistic. The reduced revenues generated from the lower numbers of passengers using the lines made it difficult for the operators to pay back the capital borrowed and pay dividends to shareholders.<ref name=SubRail_05>Wolmar, Christian, p 171</ref><ref name=Lost_Tubes_12> Badsey-Ellis, Anthony, pp. 282-283</ref> 

In an effort to improve their collective situations, the majority of the underground railways in London; the C&SLR, the CLR, the [[Northern City Line|Great Northern & City Railway]] and the [[Underground Electric Railways Company|Underground Electric Railways Company of London Limited]] (UERL, which operated the [[Bakerloo Line|Baker Street & Waterloo Railway]] (BS&WR), the [[Piccadilly Line|Great Northern, Piccadilly & Brompton Railway]] (GNP&BR), the CCE&HR and the MDR) began, from 1907, to introduce fare agreements. From 1908, they began to present themselves through common branding as the ''"Underground"''.<ref name=Lost_Tubes_12/> The [[Waterloo & City Line|Waterloo & City Railway]], which was operated by the mainline [[London and South Western Railway]], was the only tube railway that did not participate in the arrangement.

In 1912, the C&SLR submitted another bill for parliamentary consideration seeking to increase its capacity by enlarging its tunnels to the larger diameter used for the tunnels of the more recently built railways. The enlarged tunnels would allow larger, more modern rolling stock to be used and this was also provided for in the bill.<ref name=Gazette_23>

</ref> Together, the works proposed in these bills would enable the CCE&HR's trains to run over the C&SLR's route and vice versa, effectively combining the two separate railways. 

On [[1 January]] [[1913]], the LER purchased the C&SLR, paying two shares of its own stock for three of the C&SLR's<ref name=SubRail_06>Wolmar, Christian, p 205</ref> - a discount reflecting the struggling financial position of the older company.<ref name=purchase_of_CLR>At the same time, the LER also bought the Central London Railway, swapping one of its shares for one of the Central's.</ref> Both bills were enacted on [[15 August]] [[1913]] as the ''City and South London Railway Act, 1913'' and the ''London Electric Railway Act, 1913''.<ref name=Gazette_25>

In February 1919, with the War over, the C&SLR submitted a new bill which included provisions for an extension of time for the tunnel enlargement works approved in the act of 1913.<ref name=Gazette_26>

</ref> However; although the permissions to carry out the works had been renewed, the Underground companies were not in a position to raise the funds needed to pay for the works. Construction costs had increased considerably during the war years and the returns generated by the companies could not cover the cost of repaying borrowed capital.<ref name=SubRail_07>Wolmar, Christian, pp. 220-221</ref>

The projects were made possible when the government introduced the ''Trade Facilities Act, 1921'' by which the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] [[underwriting|underwrote]] loans for public works as a means of alleviating unemployment. With this support, the Underground companies were able to obtain the funds and work began on enlarging the tunnels of the C&SLR.

The tunnels were enlarged by removing a number of the cast iron segments from each tunnel ring, excavating a void behind to the required new diameter and reinstalling the segments with additional packing spacers. The northern section of the C&SLR between Euston and Moorgate was closed from [[8 August]] [[1922]], but the rest of the line remained open with enlargement works taking place at night.<ref name=CULG_02/> A collapse on [[27 November]] [[1923]] caused when a train hit temporary shoring on the incomplete excavations, filled the tunnel with soil.<ref name=CULG_02/> The line was briefly operated in two parts, but was completely closed on [[28 November]] [[1923]].<ref name=CULG_02/>

The Euston to Moorgate section reopened on [[20 April]] [[1924]], along with the new tunnels linking Euston to Camden Town.<ref name=CULG_02/> The rest of the line to Clapham Common reopened on [[1 December]] [[1924]].<ref name=CULG_02/> At the same time as the tunnels were being enlarged, the stations were modernised, with longer platforms, a new tiling scheme on platform and passageway walls and new frontages to the surface buildings. A number of stations also received [[escalator]]s to replace the original lifts.

Whilst the reconstruction works were underway, the C&SLR submitted a bill in 1922 which contained proposals to extend the line south from Clapham Common through [[Balham, London|Balham]] and [[Tooting]] to [[Morden]] in tunnel.<ref name=Gazette_29>

</ref> From Morden, the line was to continue on the surface to [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] sharing part of the route of an unbuilt railway planned from [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] to Sutton.

:see ''[[Wimbledon and Sutton Railway]] for full details''.

The bill was enacted as the ''City and South London Railway Act, 1923'' on [[2 August]] [[1923]].<ref name=gazette_30>
{{LondonGazette
|issue=32850
|date=3 August 1923

|accessdate=2007-09-20}}
</ref> Parallel negotiations with the [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] over the proposals curtailed the extension at Morden where a large new depot was also constructed. The Morden extension opened on [[13 September]] [[1926]],<ref name=CULG_02/> with stations designed by [[Charles Holden]] at:
*[[Clapham South tube station|Clapham South]]
*[[Balham tube station|Balham]] (opened on [[6 December]] [[1926]])<ref name=CULG_02/>
*[[Tooting Bec tube station|Trinity Road (Tooting Bec)]] (Tooting Bec from 1950)<ref name=DRose/>
*[[Tooting Broadway tube station|Tooting Broadway]]
*[[Colliers Wood tube station|Colliers Wood]]
*[[South Wimbledon tube station|South Wimbledon]]
*[[Morden tube station|Morden]]

Also on 13 September 1926, a further connection between the CCE&HR and the C&SLR was opened when tunnels were brought into service from the CCE&HR's [[Embankment tube station|Charing Cross]] station (now Embankment) to a Kennington station rebuilt with four platforms. An intermediate station was also constructed at [[Waterloo tube station|Waterloo]]. Thus fully integrated, combined services operated over the C&SLR and CCE&HR routes using the newly built ''"[[London Underground Standard Stock|Standard Stock]]"'' trains. On [[tube map]]s the combined lines were shown in a single colour although the separate names continued in use into the 1930s.<ref name=separate_names>The combined route was shown in black as it is today with the line names given as ''"Hampstead and Highgate Line"'' and ''"City & South London Railway"'' - for example, see [http://homepage.ntlworld.com/clive.billson/tubemaps/1926-3rd.html 1926 tube map] from [http://homepage.ntlworld.com/clivebillson/tube/tube.html A History of the London Tube Maps].</ref>

==Move to public ownership, 1924 &ndash; 1933==
Despite the modernisation of the C&SLR and other improvements made to other parts of the network,<ref name=improvements>During World War I, the BS&WR was extended from [[London Paddington station|Paddington]] to [[Watford Junction railway station|Watford Junction]]. Post war; extensions of the CLR from [[Wood Lane (Central Line) tube station|Wood Lane]] to [[Ealing Broadway station|Ealing Broadway]] (1920) and the CCE&HR from [[Golders Green tube station|Golders Green]] to [[Edgware tube station|Edgware]] (1923/1924) were opened.</ref> the Underground railways were still struggling to make a profit. The Underground Group's ownership of the highly profitable [[London General Omnibus Company]] (LGOC) since 1912 had enabled the Group, through the pooling of revenues, to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways.<ref name=LGOC>By having a virtual monopoly of bus services, the LGOC was able to generate large profits and pay dividends far higher than the underground railways ever had. In 1911, the year before its take over by the Underground Group, the dividend had been 18 per cent - Wolmar, Christian, p 204</ref> However; competition from numerous small bus companies during the early years of the 1920s eroded the profitability of the LGOC and had a negative impact on the profitability of the whole Group. 

In an effort to protect the Group's income, its Managing Director/Chairman, [[Albert Stanley, 1st Baron Ashfield|Lord Ashfield]], [[lobbying|lobbied]] the government for regulation of transport services in the London area. During the 1920s, a series of legislative initiatives were made in this direction, with Ashfield and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[London County Council]]lor (later [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|MP]]) [[Herbert Morrison]], at the forefront of debates as to the level of regulation and public control under which transport services should be brought. Ashfield aimed for regulation that would give the existing Group protection from competition and allow it to take substantive control of the LCC's [[tram]] system; Morrison preferred full public ownership.<ref name=SubRail_08>Wolmar, Christian, pp. 259-262</ref> Eventually, after several years of false starts, a bill was announced at the end of 1930 for the formation of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]], a public corporation which would take control of the Underground Group, the Metropolitan Railway as well as all buses and trams within an area designated as the [[London Passenger Transport Board#London Transport Passenger Area|London Transport Passenger Area]].<ref name=Gazette_31>

</ref>  The Board was a compromise - public ownership but not full [[nationalization|nationalisation]] - and came into existence on [[1 July]] [[1933]]. From this date the C&SLR and the other Underground companies were [[liquidation|liquidated]].<ref name=SubRail_09>Wolmar, Christian, p266</ref>

==Legacy==
The technologies of deep tube tunnelling and electric traction pioneered and proved by the C&SLR shaped the direction of subsequent underground railways built in London.<ref name=Lost_Tubes_13>Badsey-Ellis, Anthony, p 47 </ref> The C&SLR demonstrated that an underground railway could be constructed without the need to purchase large and expensive tracts of land for the shallow cuttings of sub-surface steam operated railways. Instead, it became possible to construct a tunnel at deep level without adversely effecting conditions on the surface. The C&SLR thus encouraged the construction of a network of underground railways in London, - far larger than would have been the case otherwise.<ref name=SubRail_10>Wolmar, Christian, pp. 140-141</ref>

During [[World War II]], the disused tunnels between Borough and King William Street stations were converted for use as [[air-raid shelter]]s.<ref name=KWS>Connor, J.E, pp. 10-13</ref><ref name=abandoned>[http://www.pendar.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Tube/King_William_Street_2.html Abandoned Tube Stations - King William Street]. Retrieved on [[20 September]] [[2007]]</ref> In the 1960s they were used to assist the ventilation of London Bridge station.
