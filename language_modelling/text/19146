'''South Africa''', officially the '''Republic of South Africa''' ([[Afrikaans]]: ''Republiek van Suid-Afrika'', [[Zulu language|Zulu]]: ''iRiphabliki yaseNingizimu Afrika'', [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]]: ''iRiphabliki yaseMzantsi Afrika'', [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]]: ''Riphabliki yaAfrika Dzonga'', [[Sotho_languages|Sepedi, Sesotho and Setswana]]: ''Rephaboliki ya Afrika Borwa''), is a country located at the southern tip of the [[Africa|African]] [[continent]]. It borders the countries of [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Mozambique]], [[Swaziland]], and [[Lesotho]] (an independent [[enclave]] entirely surrounded by South African territory).

South Africa has experienced a significantly different history from other nations in Africa as a result of two facts. Firstly, [[immigration]] from [[Europe]] reached levels not experienced in other African communities. Secondly, the strategic importance of the [[History of Cape Colony|Cape Sea Route]]. The closure of the [[Suez Canal]] during the [[Six Day War]] exemplifies its significance. Mineral wealth also made the country extremely important to [[Western world|Western]] interests, particularly throughout the late nineteenth century; then, with international competition and rivalry during the [[Cold War]]. As a result of immigration, South Africa is a very ethnically diverse nation. It has the largest population of people from a mixed ethnic background, [[Whites in South Africa|whites]], and [[Asians in South Africa|Indian]] communities in Africa. [[Black people|Black]] South Africans account for slightly more than 70% of the population.

Racial strife between the white minority and the black majority has played a large part in the country's [[History of South Africa|history]] and [[Politics of South Africa|politics]], culminating in [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|''apartheid'']], which was instituted in 1948 by the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] (although [[Racial segregation|segregation]] existed prior to that date). The laws that defined apartheid began to be repealed or abolished by the National Party in [[1990]] after a long and sometimes violent struggle (including [[economic sanctions]] from the [[international community]]) by the Black majority as well as many White, Coloured, and Indian South Africans.

Two philosophies originated in South Africa: [[Ubuntu (ideology)|''ubuntu'']] (the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity); and [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]]'s notion of "passive resistance" (''[[satyagraha]]''), developed while he lived in South Africa.<ref> [http://www.sagoodnews.co.za/newsletter/previous_newsletters/295581.htm Compassion: the South African way]</ref>

The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]], and regular [[Elections in South Africa|election]]s have been held for almost a century; however, the vast majority of black South Africans were not [[enfranchisement|enfranchised]] until [[1994]]. The [[economy of South Africa]] is the largest and best developed on the continent, with modern [[infrastructure]] common throughout the country.

South Africa is often referred to as "[[Rainbow Nation|The Rainbow Nation]]", a term coined by [[Archbishop]] [[Desmond Tutu]] and later adopted by then-[[President of South Africa|President]] [[Nelson Mandela]].  Mandela used the term "Rainbow Nation" as a metaphor to describe the country's newly-developing multicultural diversity in the wake of segregationist apartheid ideology.  The country's socially progressive policies are rare in Africa. By 2007, the country had joined [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Spain]], and [[Canada]] in extending the right of marriage to [[GLBT]] people.

South Africa will be the host nation for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]. It will be the first time the tournament is held in Africa.

==History==
{{main|History of South Africa}}
South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological sites in Africa. Extensive [[fossil]] remains at the [[Sterkfontein]], [[Kromdraai]] and Makapansgat caves suggest that various [[australopithecus|australopithecines]] existed in South Africa from about three million years ago. These were succeeded by various species of ''Homo'', including ''[[Homo habilis]]'', ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and modern man, ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking [[Bantu peoples of South Africa|peoples]], [[iron]]-using agriculturists and herdsmen, moved south of the [[Limpopo River]] into modern-day South Africa by the fourth or fifth century (the [[Bantu expansion]]) displacing the original Khoi and San speakers. They slowly moved south and the earliest ironworks in modern-day [[KwaZulu-Natal Province]] are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the [[Xhosa]] people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier Khoi and San people, reaching the [[Fish River, Eastern Cape|Fish River]], in today's [[Eastern Cape Province]]. These [[Iron Age]] populations displaced earlier [[hunter-gatherer]] peoples as they migrated.
[[Image:JanVanRiebeckArrival.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Romanticised painting of an account of the arrival of [[Jan van Riebeeck]]]]

The written history of South Africa begins with the accounts of European navigators passing South Africa on the [[East Indies]] trade routes. The first navigator European to achieve circumnavigation of the Cape was the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer [[Bartolomeu Dias]] in [[1488]]. 

When [[Bartolomeu Dias]] returned to Lisbon he carried news of this discovery he called "Cabo das Tormentas" (cape of storms). But for his sponsor, [[Henry the Navigator]], chose a different name, "Cabo da Boa Esperan<U+00E7>a" [[Cape of Good Hope]] for it promised a sea route to the riches of India, which was eagerly anticipated in [[Portugal]].

Along with the accounts of the early navigators, the accounts of shipwreck survivors provide the earliest written accounts of Southern Africa. In the two centuries following [[1488]], a number of small fishing settlements were made along the coast by Portuguese sailors, but no written account of these settlements survives. In [[1652]] a victualling station was established at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] by [[Jan van Riebeeck]] on behalf of the [[Dutch East India Company]]. For most of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the slowly-expanding settlement was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] possession. The Dutch settlers eventually met the southwesterly expanding [[Xhosa]] people in the region of the [[Fish River, Eastern Cape|Fish River]]. A series of wars, called [[Cape Frontier Wars]], ensued, mainly caused by conflicting land and livestock interests.

To ease Cape labour shortages [[slaves]] were brought from [[Indonesia]], [[Madagascar]], and [[India]]. Furthermore, troublesome leaders, often of royal descent, were banished from Dutch colonies to South Africa. This group of slaves eventually gave rise to a population that now identifies themselves as "[[Cape Malays]]". [[Cape Malays]] have traditionally been accorded a higher social status by the European colonists - many became wealthy landowners, but became increasingly dispossessed as [[Apartheid]] developed. Cape Malay mosques in [[District Six]] were spared, and now serve as monuments for the destruction that occurred around them.

Most of the descendants of these slaves, who often married with Dutch settlers, were later classified together with the remnants of the Khoikhoi as [[Cape Coloureds]]. Further intermingling within the [[Cape Coloureds|Cape Coloured]] population itself, as well as with [[Xhosa]] and other South African people, now means that they constitute roughly 50% of the population in the [[Western Cape Province]].

[[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] seized the [[Cape of Good Hope]] area in 1797 seeking to use [[Cape Town]] in particular as a stop on the route to Australia and India. The [[Dutch East India Company]] declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1805. The British continued the frontier wars against the AmaXhosa, pushing the eastern frontier eastward through a line of forts established along the Fish River and consolidating it by encouraging [[1820 Settlers|British settlement]]. Due to pressure of [[abolitionist]] societies in Britain, the British parliament first stopped its global [[slave trade]] in 1806, then abolished slavery in all its colonies in 1833.

The discovery of [[diamond]]s in 1867 and [[gold]] in 1886 encouraged economic growth and immigration, intensifying the subjugation of the natives. The [[Boers]] successfully resisted British encroachments during the [[First Boer War]] (1880&ndash;1881) using [[guerrilla warfare]] tactics, much better suited to local conditions. However, the British returned in greater numbers without their red jackets in the [[Second Boer War]] (1899&ndash;1902). The Boers' attempt to ally themselves with German [[South West Africa]] provided the British with yet another excuse to take control of the Boer Republics.
[[Image:Boercamp1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Boer]] women and children in British [[concentration camp]]s]]

The Boers resisted fiercely, but the British eventually overwhelmed the Boer forces, using their superior numbers, improved tactics and external supply chains. Also during this war, the British used controversial [[Concentration Camps]] and [[Scorched Earth]] tactics. The [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] specified full British sovereignty over the South African republics, and the British government agreed to assume the [[British Pound|<U+00A3>]]3&nbsp;000&nbsp;000 war debt owed by the Afrikaner governments. One of the main provisions of the treaty ending the war was that 'Blacks' would not be allowed to vote, except in the Cape Colony.

After four years of negotiations, the [[Union of South Africa]] was created from the [[Cape Colony|Cape]] and [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]] colonies, as well as the republics of [[Orange Free State]] and [[Transvaal]], on [[May 31]], [[1910]], exactly eight years after the end of the Second Boer War. The newly-created Union of South Africa was a [[dominion]]. In 1934, the [[South African Party]] and [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] merged to form the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]], seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and [[English language|English]]-speaking 'Whites', but split in 1939 over the Union's entry into [[World War II]] as an ally of the [[United Kingdom]], a move which the National Party strongly opposed.

In 1948, the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] was elected to power, and began [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|implementing a series of harsh segregationist laws]] that would become known collectively as [[apartheid]]. Not surprisingly, this segregation also applied to the wealth acquired during rapid industrialisation of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. While the White minority enjoyed the highest [[standard of living]] in all of Africa, often comparable to "[[First World]]" western nations, the Black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. However, the average income and life expectancy of a black, 'Indian' or 'coloured' South African compared favourably to many other African states, such as [[Ghana]] and [[Tanzania]].

Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread [[International sanctions|sanctions]] and [[divestment]] abroad and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa. (See also the article on the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era]].) A long period of harsh suppression by the government, and at times violent resistance, [[Strike action|strike]]s, marches, protests, and [[sabotage]], by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), followed. In 1990, the National Party government took the first step towards negotiating itself out of power when it lifted the ban on the African National Congress and other [[left-wing]] political organisations, and released [[Nelson Mandela]] from prison after twenty-seven years' incarceration on a [[sabotage]] sentence. Apartheid legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and the first [[South African general election, 1994|multi-racial elections]] were held in 1994. The ANC won by an overwhelming majority and has been in power ever since.

Despite the end of apartheid, millions of South Africans, mostly black, continue to live in [[poverty]]. This is partly attributed to the legacy of the apartheid system (although poverty is also a problem throughout much of Africa), and, increasingly, what many see as the failure of the current government to tackle social issues, coupled with the monetary and fiscal discipline of the current government to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. In the ten years since the ANC government took power, South Africa's [[United Nations]] [[Human Development Index]] has fallen dramatically, while it was steadily rising until the mid-1990s.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://hdr.undp.org/hdr2006/statistics/countries/country_fact_sheets/cty_fs_ZAF.html|

==Government & politics==

[[Image:CentralPretoria.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The central area of [[Pretoria]], the administrative capital of South Africa]]<!-- Please, the city's name is Pretoria, not Tshwane. Tshwane refers to the municipality which Pretoria finds itself in. The administrative devisions however is situated in Pretoria. Do not change this.-->

South Africa has a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[parliament]]: the ninety members of the [[National Council of Provinces]] (the [[upper house]]); and the four hundred members of the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] (the [[lower house]]). Members of the lower house are elected on a population basis by [[proportional representation]]: half of the members are elected from national lists and half are elected from provincial lists. Ten members are elected to represent each province in the National Council of Provinces, regardless of the population of the province. Elections for both chambers are held every five years. The government is formed in the lower house, and the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly is the [[President of South Africa|President]].

Current South African politics are dominated by the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), which received 69.7% of the vote during the last [[South African general election, 2004|2004 general election]] and 66.3% of the vote in the [[South African municipal election, 2006|2006 municipal election]]. The main challenger to the ANC's rule is the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] party, which received 12.4% of the vote in the 2004 election and 14.8% in the 2006 election. The leader of this party is [[Tony Leon]]. The formerly dominant [[New National Party (South Africa)|New National Party]], which introduced apartheid through its predecessor, the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], has suffered increasing humiliation at election polls since 1994, and finally voted to disband. It chose to merge with the ANC on [[9 April]] [[2005]]. Other major political parties represented in Parliament are the [[Inkatha Freedom Party]], which mainly represents [[Zulu]] voters, and the [[Independent Democrats (South Africa)|Independent Democrats]], who took 6.97% and 1.7% of the vote respectively in the 2004 election.

==Law==
{{main|Law of South Africa}}
The primary sources of South Africa law were Roman-Dutch merchantile law and personal law with English Common law, as imports of Dutch settlements and British colonialism. The first European based law in South Africa was brought by the [[Dutch East India Company]] and is called [[Roman-Dutch law]]. It was imported before the codification of European law into the [[Napoleonic Code]] and is comparable in many ways to [[Scots law|Scottish law]]. This was followed in the 19th Century by [[Law of the United Kingdom|British law]] both [[Common law|common]] and [[Statutory law|statutory]]. Starting in 1910 with unification, South Africa had its own [[parliament]] which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies.

When apartheid ended in 1994, the South African government had to integrate the formerly independent and semi-independent [[Bantustan]]s into the political structure of South Africa. To this end, it abolished the four former provinces of South Africa ([[Cape Province]], [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]], [[Orange Free State]], and [[Transvaal]]) and replaced them with nine fully integrated provinces. The new provinces are usually much smaller than the former provinces, which theoretically give local governments more resources to distribute over smaller areas.

The nine provinces are further sub-divided into [[Districts of South Africa|52 districts]]: [[Metropolitan municipality (South Africa)|6 metropolitan]] and [[District municipality (South Africa)|46 district municipalities]]. The 46 district municipalities are further subdivided into [[Municipalities of South Africa|231 local municipalities]]. The district municipalities also contain 20 district management areas (mostly game parks) that are directly governed by the district municipalities. The six metropolitan municipalities perform the functions of both district and local municipalities. The new provinces are:

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of South Africa}}
[[Image:Sf-map.png|framed|thumb|Map of South Africa]]
[[Image:South Africa sat.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Satellite picture of South Africa]]

South Africa is located at the southern most region of Africa, with a long [[coastline]] that stretches more than 2 500&nbsp;[[kilometre]]s (1 550 [[mile|mi]]) and across two [[ocean]]s (the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]]). At 470 979&nbsp;[[square miles|mi<U+00B2>]] (1 219 912&nbsp;[[square kilometre|km<U+00B2>]])<ref>{{cite web|
url=https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html|
title=World Fact Book|
publisher=CIA}}</ref>, South Africa is the world's 25th-largest country (after [[Mali]]). It is comparable in size to [[Colombia]], and is nearly twice the size of the US state of [[Texas]]. [[Njesuthi]] in the [[Drakensberg]] at 3,408&nbsp;m is the highest peak in South Africa.

South Africa has a great variety of climate zones, from the extreme [[desert]] of the southern [[Namib]] in the farthest northwest to the lush [[subtropics|subtropical]] climate in the east along the border with [[Mozambique]] and the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] ocean. From the east, the land quickly rises over a [[mountain|mountainous]] [[escarpment]] towards the interior [[plateau]] known as the [[Highveld]]. Even though South Africa is classified as [[semi-arid]], there is considerable variation in [[climate]] as well as [[topography]].

The interior of South Africa is a giant, rather flat, and sparsely populated [[scrubland]] [[Karoo]], which is drier towards the northwest along the Namib desert. In contrast, the eastern coastline is lush and well-watered, which produces a climate similar to the tropics. The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the [[Mediterranean]] with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous [[Fynbos]] [[Biome]]. This area also produces much of South Africa's [[wine]]. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many [[shipwreck]]s. Further east on the country's south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the [[Garden Route]].

The [[Orange Free State|Free State]] is particularly flat due to the fact that it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the [[Vaal River]], the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat. [[Johannesburg]], in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1 740&nbsp;[[metre]]s (5 709&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) and receives an annual rainfall of 760&nbsp;millimetres (30&nbsp;[[inch|in]]). Winters in this region are cold, although [[snow]] is rare.

To the north of Johannesburg, the altitude drops beyond the Highveld's escarpment, and turns into the lower lying Bushveld, an area of mixed dry forest and an abundance of wildlife. East of the Highveld, beyond the eastern escarpment, the Lowveld stretches towards the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] ocean. It has particularly high temperatures, and is also the location of extended subtropical agriculture. The high [[Drakensberg|Drakensberg mountains]], which form the south-eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited [[ski]]ing opportunities in winter. Many people think that the coldest place in South Africa is [[Sutherland, South Africa|Sutherland]] in the western [[Roggeveld Mountains]], where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as &minus;15 degrees [[Celsius]] (5&nbsp;<U+00B0>[[Fahrenheit|F]]). In fact, the coldest place is actually Buffelsfontein, which is in the Molteno district of the Eastern Cape. Buffelsfontein recorded a low of &minus;18.6 degrees [[Celsius]].<ref>{{cite web|

South Africa also has one possession, the small sub-Antarctic archipelago of the [[Prince Edward Islands]], consisting of [[Marion Island]] (290&nbsp;km<U+00B2>/112&nbsp;mi<U+00B2>) and Prince Edward Island (45&nbsp;km<U+00B2>/17.3&nbsp;mi<U+00B2>) (not to be confused with the [[Prince Edward Island|Canadian province of the same name]]).

==Flora and fauna==
[[Image:Fynbos.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Fynbos]], a [[floristic province|floral kingdom]] unique to South Africa, is found near [[Cape Town]]]]

South Africa has more than 20,000 different [[plant]]s, or about 10% of all the known [[species]] of plants on [[Earth]], making it particularly rich in plant biodiversity.

South Africa's most prevalent biome is [[grassland]], particularly on the [[Highveld]], where the plant cover is dominated by different [[Poaceae|grasses]], low [[shrub]]s, and [[acacia tree]]s, mainly camel-thorn and whitethorn. [[Vegetation]] becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low [[precipitation (meteorology)|rainfall]]. There are several species of water-storing [[succulent]]s like [[aloe]]s and euphorbias in the very hot and dry [[Namaqualand]] area. The grass and thorn [[Savanna|savannah]] turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the northeast of the country, with more dense growth. There are significant numbers of [[baobab]] trees in this area, near the northern end of [[Kruger National Park]].<ref> [http://www.southafrica-travel.net/pages/e_plants.htm South Africa Online Travel Guide: Plants and Vegetation in South Africa]</ref>

The [[Fynbos]] [[Biome]], one of the six [[floristic province|floral kingdom]]s, is located in a small region of the [[Western Cape]] and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of floral biodiversity. The majority of the plants are [[evergreen]] hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like [[leaf|leaves]], such as the [[sclerophyllous]] plants. Another uniquely South African plant is the [[protea]] genus of flowering plants. There are around 130 different species of protea in South Africa.

While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, it has few [[forest]]s. Only 1% of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the [[humid]] [[coastal plain]] along the [[Indian Ocean]] in [[KwaZulu-Natal]]. There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of [[fire]], known as montane forests. [[Plantation]]s of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native [[eucalyptus]] and [[pine]]. South Africa has lost extensive acreage of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to [[overpopulation]], sprawling development patterns and [[deforestation]] during the nineteenth century. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many (e.g. [[Black Wattle]], Port Jackson, [[Hakea]], [[Lantana]] and [[Jacaranda]]) posing a significant threat to the native [[biodiversity]] and the already scarce water resources. The original [[temperate forest]] that met the first European settlers to South Africa was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African [[hardwood]] trees like [[Real Yellowwood]] ''(Podocarpus latifolius)'', [[stinkwood]] ''(Ocotea bullata)'', and South African [[Black Ironwood]] ''(Olea laurifolia)'' are under government protection.

Numerous [[mammal]]s are found in the [[bushveld]] habitats including [[lion]], [[leopard]], [[White Rhino]], [[Blue Wildebeest]], [[kudu]], [[impala]], [[hyena]], [[hippopotamus]], and [[giraffe]]. There is a significant extent of the bushveld habitat in the northeast including [[Kruger National Park]] and the [[Mala Mala]] Reserve, as well as in the far north in the [[Waterberg Biosphere]].

Climate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi-arid region, with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and drought. According to computer generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI)<ref> [http://www.sanbi.org South African National Biodiversity Institute]</ref> (along with many of its partner institutions), parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about one degree Celsius along the coast to more than four degrees Celsius in the already hot hinterland such as the [[Northern Cape]] in late spring and summertime by 2050.

The Cape Floral Kingdom has been identified as one of the global [[biodiversity hotspots]] since it will be hit very hard by [[climate change]] and has such a great diversity of life. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire and climbing temperatures are expected to push many of these [[rare species]] towards [[extinction]]. [[Scorched : South Africa's changing climate]] takes much of the modelling produced by SANBI and presents it in an accessible travelogue-style collection of essays.<ref> http://www.scorched.co.za Scorched : South Africa<U+2019>s changing climate</ref>

South Africa houses many endemic species, among them the [[critically endangered]] [[Riverine Rabbit]] (''Bunolagus monticullaris'') in the [[Karoo]].

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of South Africa}}
[[Image:CentralDurban.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Durban]], well-known resort city on the [[Indian Ocean]] coast and site of Africa's largest commercial port]]
[[Image:Cape Town Waterfront.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Victoria & Alfred Waterfront]] in [[Cape Town]] with [[Table Mountain]] in the background. Cape Town has become an important [[retail]] and [[tourism]] centre for the country, and attracts the largest number of foreign visitors in South Africa]]

By UN classification South Africa is a middle-income country with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors, a [[stock exchange]] (the [[JSE Securities Exchange]]), that ranks among the top twenty in the world, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centres throughout the region. South Africa's per capita [[GDP]], corrected for [[purchasing power parity]], positions the country as one of the fifty wealthiest in the world.

In many respects, South Africa is developed; however, this development is significantly localised around four areas, namely Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Pretoria/Johannesburg. Beyond these four economic centres, development is marginal and poverty still reigns despite Government strategies. However, key marginal areas are experiencing rapid growth recently. Such areas include: Mossel Bay to Plettenberg Bay; Rustenburg area; Nelspruit area; Bloemfontein; Cape West Coast; KZN North Coast amongst others.

Large income gaps and a [[dual economy]] designate South Africa as developing; South Africa has one of the highest rates of [[List of countries by income equality|income inequality]] in the world. Consecutive growth rates in the last ten years are helping lower unemployment; however, daunting economic problems remain. Other problems are crime, corruption, and HIV/AIDS.

At the start of 2000, President Thabo Mbeki vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment by relaxing restrictive labour laws, stepping up the pace of [[privatisation]], and cutting unneeded governmental spending. His policies face strong opposition from organised [[labour movement|labour]]. It is estimated that South Africa accounts for up to 30% of the [[gross domestic product]] of the entire African continent{{fact|date=2007}}. South Africa is also the continent's largest energy producer and consumer.

The [[South African rand|rand]], the world's most actively-traded emerging [[market currency]], has joined an elite club of fifteen currencies, the [[Continuous linked settlement]] (CLS), where forex transactions are settled immediately, lowering the risks of transacting across [[time zone]]s. The South African rand (ZAR) was the best performing currency against the US dollar between 2002 and 2005, according to the [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] Currency Scorecard.

The volatility of the [[South African rand|rand]] has affected economic activity, with the rand falling sharply during 2001, hitting an historic low of R13.85 to the [[United States dollar]], raising fears of inflation, and causing the Reserve Bank to increase [[interest rate]]s. The rand has since recovered, trading at R6.99 to the dollar as of January 2007 while the South African Reserve Bank's policy of inflation targeting has brought inflation under control. The stronger rand has however put exporters under considerable pressure, with many calling for government to intervene in the exchange rate to help soften the rand, and many others dismissing staff.

21.5% of the adult South African population have been estimated to be [[HIV]] positive in 2003.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/sf.html CIA World Factbook, "South Africa"]</ref> The government has recently, after much delay, devoted substantial resources to fighting this pandemic. A recent study from the African Journal of AIDS Research by Thomas Rehle and Olive Shisana showed the infection rate starting to level off, from 4.2% to 1.7% infection rate for 15<U+2013>49 year olds, and AIDS deaths peaking at 487,320 in 2008.

In 2000, President [[Thabo Mbeki|Mbeki]] publicly questioned the importance of HIV in causing [[AIDS]], controversially suggesting that the main cause was "poverty."<ref> [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/826742.stm BBC News: Controversy dogs Aids forum]</ref>In 2001 the government appointed a panel of scientists, including a number of [[AIDS dissident]]s (who question the mainstream view on HIV), to report back on the issue. Following their report, the government stated that it continues to base its policy on the premise that the cause of AIDS is indeed HIV.<ref> [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1260941.stm BBC News: South African split over Aids] </ref> The controversy has not abated, and organisations such as the [[Treatment Action Campaign]] continue to mount political and legal challenges to what they claim is the government's slow response to the epidemic.

Refugees from poorer neighbouring countries abound with immigrants from the DRC, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and many others representing a large portion of the informal sector. With high unemployment levels amongst poorer South Africans, [[xenophobia]] is a very real fear and many people born in South Africa feel resentful of immigrants who are seen to be depriving the native population of jobs, a feeling which has been given credibility by the fact that many South African employers have employed migrants from other countries for lower pay than South African citizens, especially in the [[construction]], [[tourism]], [[agriculture]] and [[domestic service]] industries. Illegal immigrants are also heavily involved in informal trading.<ref> [http://www.iss.co.za/pubs/ASR/5No4/StrategigPerspectives.html African Security Review Vol&nbsp;5 No&nbsp;4, 1996: Strategic Perspectives on Illegal Immigration into South Africa]</ref> However, many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the South African immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994.<ref> [http://www.queensu.ca/samp/sampresources/samppublications/policyseries/policy20.htm Queens College: The Brain Gain: Skilled Migrants and Immigration Policy in Post-Apartheid South Africa]</ref>

==Agriculture==
[[Image:Farm in Mpumalanga.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Workers planting on a farm in the central area of [[Mpumalanga]]]]
[[Image:SouthAfricaFieldwork21989.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Farm workers]]

South Africa has a large agricultural sector and is a net exporter of [[farming]] products. There are almost a thousand [[agricultural cooperative]]s and [[agribusiness]]es throughout the country, and agricultural exports have constituted 8% of South Africa's total exports for the past five years. The agricultural industry contributes around 10% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2.6% of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] for the nation.<ref>Human Rights Watch, 2001. <u>Unequal Protection: The State Response to Violent Crime on South African Farms</u> ISBN 1-56432-263-7 http://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/safrica2/</ref> However, due to the [[arid]]ity of the land, only 13.5% can be used for crop production, and only 3% is considered high potential land.<ref> Mohamed, Najma. 2000. ''Greening Land and Agrarian Reform: A Case for Sustainable Agriculture''. In <u>At the Crossroads: Land and Agrarian Reform in South Africa into the 21st Century</u>. Ed. Cousins, Ben. Bellville, School of Government, University of the Western Cape. ISBN 1-86808-467-1.</ref>

Although the commercial farming sector is relatively well developed, people in some rural areas still survive on [[subsistence agriculture]]. It is the eighth largest wine producer in the world, and the eleventh largest producer of sunflower seed. South Africa is a net exporter of agricultural products and foodstuffs, the largest number of exported items being [[sugar]], [[grape]]s, [[citrus]], [[nectarine]]s, [[winemaking|wine]] and [[deciduous]] fruit. The largest locally produced crop is [[maize]](corn), and it has been estimated that 9 million tons are produced every year, with 7.4 million tons being consumed. [[Livestock]] are also popular on South African farms, with the country producing 85% of all meat consumed. The dairy industry consists of around 4,300 milk producers providing employment for 60,000 farm workers and contributing to the livelihoods of around 40,000 others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southafrica.co.za/agriculture_29.html |title=South Africa Online: Agriculture |accessdate=2006-07-17}}</ref>

In recent years, the agricultural sector has introduced several reforms, some of which are controversial, such as [[land reform]] and the deregulation of the market for agricultural products. Land reform has been criticised both by farmers' groups and by landless workers, the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough, and the former alleging racist treatment and expressing concerns that a similar situation to [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe's land reform policy]] may develop,<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,1052-2352011,00.html South Africa's bitter harvest]</ref> a fear exacerbated by comments made by the country's [[Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka|deputy president]].<ref> [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4718707.stm BBC News: South Africans' long wait for land]</ref><ref> [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4140990.stm BBC News: SA 'to learn from' land seizures]</ref> The sector continues to face problems, with increased foreign competition and crime being two of the major challenges for the industry. The government has been accused of not devoting enough time and money to tackle the problem of [[South African farm attacks|farm attacks]] as opposed to other forms of violent crime.<ref> [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0,,2772-2100080,00.html The Sunday Times Magazine: Farms of Fear] </ref>

Another issue which affects South African agriculture is environmental damage caused by misuse of the land and global climate change. South Africa is unusually vulnerable to climate change and resultant diminution of surface waters. Some predictions shows surface water supply could decrease by 60% by the year 2070 in parts of the Western Cape.<ref> [http://www.alertnet.org/thefacts/reliefresources/114303555233.htm Reuters Alertnet: "Climate change to create African 'water refugees' <U+2013> scientists", accessed [[21 September]] [[2006]]]</ref> To reverse the damage caused by land mismanagement, the government has supported a scheme which promotes [[sustainable development]] and the use of natural resources.<ref> [http://www.nda.agric.za/ Department of Agriculture South Africa]</ref>

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of South Africa}}
South Africa is a nation of over 47 million people of diverse origins, [[culture]]s, [[language]]s, and [[belief]]s. The last [[South African National Census of 2001|census]] was held in 2001 and the next will be in 2011. [[Statistics South Africa]] provided five [[race|racial]] categories by which people could classify themselves, the last of which, "unspecified/other" drew negligible responses, and these results were omitted.<ref> [http://www.statssa.gov.za/census01/html/default.asp Statistics South Africa: Census 2001] </ref> The 2006 estimated figures for the other categories were [[Black (people)|Black African]] at 79.5%, [[Whites in South Africa|White]] at 9.2%, [[Coloured]] at 8.9%, and [[Asians in South Africa|Indian or Asian]] at 2.5%.<ref>{{cite web|

url=http://www.xist.org/earth/pop_growth.aspx|
title=The demographical status of the world's population|
publisher=GeoHive: Global Statistics}}</ref>

By far the major part of the population classified itself as African or black, but it is not culturally or linguistically homogeneous. Major ethnic groups include the [[Zulu]], [[Xhosa]], [[Basotho]] (South Sotho), [[Bapedi]] (North Sotho), [[Venda people|Venda]], [[Tswana]], [[Shangaan|Tsonga]], [[Swazi]] and [[Ndebele people (South Africa)|Ndebele]], all of which speak [[Bantu languages]] (see ''[[Bantu peoples of South Africa]]'').

Some, such as the Zulu, Xhosa, Bapedi and Venda groups, are unique to South Africa. Other groups are distributed across the borders with South Africa's neighbours: The [[Basotho]] group is also the major ethnic group in [[Lesotho]]. The [[Tswana]] ethnic group constitute the majority of the population of [[Botswana]]. The [[Swazi]] ethnic group is the major ethnic group in [[Swaziland]]. The [[Ndebele people (South Africa)|Ndebele]] ethnic group is also found in [[Matabeleland]] in [[Zimbabwe]], where they are known as the [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Matabele]]. These Ndebele people are however in effect Zulu people because the language they speak is Zulu and they are the descendants of a faction under the warrior [[Mzilikazi]] that escaped persecution from [[Shaka]] by migrating to their current territory. The [[Shangaan|Tsonga]] ethnic group is also found in southern [[Mozambique]], where they are known as the Shangaan.

The white population descends largely from colonial immigrants: [[Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]] [[Huguenot]], and [[United Kingdom|British]]. Culturally and linguistically, they are divided into the [[Afrikaners]], who speak [[Afrikaans]], and [[English language|English]]-speaking groups, many of whom originated from British immigrants (see ''[[Anglo African]]''). Many small communities immigrating over the last century retain the use of other languages. The white population is on the decrease due to a low birth rate and emigration; as a factor in their decision to emigrate, many cite the high [[Crime in South Africa|crime]] rate and the government's [[affirmative action]] policies. In the first decade after the ANC took power, a million whites emigrated. <ref>http://www.amren.com/mtnews/archives/2006/09/million_whites.php
</ref><ref>http://www.unisa.ac.za/default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&ContentID=13537</ref>
<ref>http://www.queensu.ca/samp/sampresources/samppublications/policyseries/policy23.htm</ref>
<ref>http://www.economist.com/world/africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=4277319</ref> This trend is unlikely to change in the near future.

The term "[[Coloured]]" is still largely used for the people of mixed race descended from slaves brought in from East and Central Africa, the indigenous [[Khoisan]] who lived in the [[Cape of Good Hope|Cape]] at the time, indigenous African Blacks, Whites (mostly the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]/[[Afrikaner]] and British settlers) as well as an admixture of [[Javanese]], [[Malay people|Malay]], [[India]]n, [[Malagasy]] and other European (such as [[Portugal|Portuguese]]) and Asian blood (such as [[Burmese]]). The majority speak Afrikaans. Khoisan is a term used to describe two separate groups, physically similar in that they were light-skinned and small in stature. The [[Khoikhoi]], who were called ''Hottentots'' by the Europeans, were pastoralists and were effectively annihilated; the San, called [[Bushmen]] by the Europeans, were hunter-gatherers. Within what is known as the Coloured community, more recent immigrants will also be found: Coloureds from the former [[Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]) and [[Namibia]] and immigrants of mixed descent from India and [[Myanmar|Burma]] ([[Anglo-Indians]]/[[Anglo-Burmese]]) who were welcomed to the Cape when India and Burma received their Independence.

The major part of the [[Asians in South Africa|Asian]] population of the country is Indian in origin (see [[Indian South Africans]]), many of them descended from indentured workers brought in the nineteenth century to work on the [[sugar]] [[plantation]]s of the eastern coastal area then known as [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]]. There is also a significant group of [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] South Africans (approximately 100,000 individuals) and [[Overseas Vietnamese|Vietnamese]] South Africans (approximately 50,000 individuals).

==HIV/AIDS==
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in South Africa}}
{{Merge|HIV/AIDS in South Africa|date=February 2007}}
As in many African countries, the spread of AIDS (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) is a serious problem in South Africa.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avert.org/aidssouthafrica.htm |title=HIV & Aids in South Africa |publisher=Avert |accessdate=2006-10-08}}</ref> The link between HIV, a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS has long been denied by the president and the health minister, who have insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to malnutrition, and hence poverty, and not HIV.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/21094 |title="Sack SA Health Minister" <U+2013> world's AIDS experts |publisher=afrol News |accessdate=2006-10-08}}</ref>

AIDS is affecting mainly those who are sexually active, which means the demographics of the country are slowly changing. Most deaths are people who are also economically active, resulting in many families losing their primary wage earners. This is resulting in many 'AIDS orphans' who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support.<ref name="avertaids">{{cite web |url=http://www.avert.org/aidsorphans.htm |title=AIDS orphans |publisher=Avert |accessdate=2006-10-08}}</ref> It is estimated that there are 1,100,000 orphans in South Africa.<ref name="avertaids"/> Elderly people, traditionally supported by younger members of the family, are also becoming more and more dependent on the state for financial support.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Religion==
According to the latest 2001 national census, the Christian proportion of the population is broken down to Zion Christian 11.1%, Pentecostal/Charismatic 8.2%, Catholic 7.1%, Methodist 6.8%, Dutch Reformed 6.7%, Anglican 3.8%, and other Christian 36%. Further more, [[Islam in South Africa]] accounted for 1.5% of the population, 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 2.3% were other and 1.4% were unspecified.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/sf.html]</ref>

African Indigenous Churches were the largest of the [[Christian]] groups.
It was believed that many of these persons who claimed no affiliation with any organized religion adhered to traditional indigenous religions.Many persons combined Christian and traditional indigenous religious practices.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71325.htm]</ref>

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of South Africa}}
[[Image:SafrikaIMG 8414.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Prison]] Buildings on [[Robben Island]], the holding place of several [[apartheid|anti-apartheid]] fighters including [[Nelson Mandela]], who was imprisoned there for eighteen years. Robben Island is now a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]]]
[[Image:SouthAfricaDecoratedHouses.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Decorated houses, [[Drakensberg Mountains]]]]

It may be argued that there is no "single" culture in South Africa because of its ethnic diversity. Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety of South African cuisine. In addition to [[food]], [[music]] and [[dance]] feature prominently.

[[South African cuisine]] is heavily [[meat|meat-based]] and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a ''[[braai]]''. South Africa has also developed into a major [[wine]] producer, with some of the best [[vineyard]]s in the world lying in valleys around [[Stellenbosch]], [[Franschoek]], [[Paarl]] and [[Barrydale]].

There is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages, and have developed a unique style called [[Kwaito]]. Of note is [[Brenda Fassie]], who launched to fame with her song "Weekend Special", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]], while the [[Soweto String Quartet]] performs classic music with an African flavour. White and Coloured South African singers are historically influenced by European musical styles including such western metal bands such as [[Seether]]. [[Afrikaans]] music covers multiple genres, such as the [[contemporary]] [[Steve Hofmeyr]] and the [[punk rock]] band [[Fokofpolisiekar]]. Crossover artists such as [[Johnny Clegg]] and his bands [[Juluka]] and [[Savuka]] have enjoyed various success underground, publically, and abroad.

The country's black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that traditional dance and music survive; as blacks have become increasingly [[urbanisation|urbanised]] and [[Western world|westernised]], aspects of traditional culture have declined. Urban blacks usually speak [[English language|English]] or [[Afrikaans]] in addition to their native tongue. There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of [[Khoisan languages]] which are not official languages, but are one of the eight officially recognised languages. There are small groups of speakers of [[endangered language]]s, most of which are from the Khoi-San family, that receive no official status; however, some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival.

The [[upper class]] lifestyle is similar in many respects to that of people found in [[Western Europe]], [[North America]] and [[Australasia]]. Members of the upper class often study and work abroad for greater exposure to the world's markets. In their travels they are often referred to as "Southies" or "southies" because they are from South Africa, which is South of normal Africa. 

Despite considerable discrimination under apartheid, Coloureds tend to relate more to white South African culture rather than black South African culture, especially [[Afrikaans]]-speaking Coloured people whose [[language]] and [[religion|religious]] beliefs are similar or identical to white [[Afrikaner]]s. The exceptions are coloured individuals and families who were personally involved in the struggle against apartheid and who prefer to be called black. Such cases are generally in the minority.

[[Asians in South Africa|Asians]], predominantly of [[India]]n origin, preserve their own cultural heritage, languages and religious beliefs, being either [[Christian]], [[Hinduism|Hindu]] or [[Sunni Muslim]] and speaking English, with Indian languages like [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] or [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] being spoken less frequently. Most Indians live lifestyles similar to that of whites. The first Indians arrived on the famous [[Truro (ship)|Truro ship]] as [[indentured servant|indentured labourers]] in Natal to work the Sugar Cane Fields. There is a much smaller [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] community in South Africa, although its numbers have increased due to immigration from [[Taiwan]].

South Africa has also had a large influence in the [[Scouting]] movement, with many Scouting traditions and ceremonies coming from the experiences of [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]] (the founder of Scouting) during his time in South Africa as a military officer in the 1890s. The [[South African Scout Association]] was one of the first youth organisations to open its doors to youth and adults of all races in South Africa. This happened on [[2 July]] [[1977]] at a conference known as ''Quo Vadis''.<ref name="scouthistorypage">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2006| url = http://www.scouting.org.za/visitors/history.html | title = History of Scouting in South Africa | format = | work = History of Scouting in South Africa| publisher = South African Scout Association | accessdate = 2006-11-30}}</ref>

South Africa has eleven [[official language]]s: [[Afrikaans]], [[South African English|English]], [[Ndebele language|Ndebele]], [[Northern Sotho language|Northern Sotho]], [[Sesotho language|Southern Sotho]], [[Swati language|Swati]], [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]], [[Tswana language|Tswana]], [[Venda language|Venda]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]]. In this regard it is [[Official languages of India|second only to India]] in number. While each language is technically equal to every other, English has emerged recently as the chief-among-peers as it is the most widely spoken language across racial barriers{{Fact|date=February 2007}} as well as globally, even though it is not the most widely spoken language by population. There are [[Official names of South Africa|eleven official names]] for South Africa, one in each of the official national languages.

The country also recognises eight non-official languages: [[Fanagalo language|Fanagalo]], [[Khoe language|Khoe]], [[Lobedu language|Lobedu]], [[Nama language|Nama]], [[Ndebele language|Northern Ndebele]], [[Phuthi language|Phuthi]], [[San language|San]] and [[South African Sign Language]]. These non-official languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.

Many of the "unofficial languages" of the [[Bushmen|San]] and [[Khoikhoi]] people contain regional [[dialect]]s stretching northward into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming [[Extinct language|extinct]].

Many white South Africans also speak other [[Europe]]an languages, such as [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (also spoken by Angolan and Mozambican blacks), [[German language|German]], and [[Greek language|Greek]], while many [[Asians in South Africa|Asians]] and [[Indian South Africans|Indians]] in South Africa speak [[South Asia]]n languages, such as [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]].

==Crime==
{{main|Crime in South Africa}}
Crime has been a major problem in South Africa. According to a survey for the period 1998<U+2013>2000 compiled by the [[United Nations]], South Africa was ranked second for [[assault]] and murder (by all means) per capita, in addition to being ranked second for [[rape]] and first for rapes per capita.<ref> [http://www.nationmaster.com/red/country/sf/Crime&b_cite=1 NationMaster: South African Crime Statistics]</ref> Total crime per capita is tenth out of the sixty countries in the data set. Nevertheless, crime has had a pronounced effect on society: many wealthier South Africans moved into [[gated community|gated communities]], abandoning the central business districts of some cities for the relative security of suburbs. This effect is most pronounced in [[Johannesburg]], although the trend is noticeable in other cities as well. Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a big motivator for them to leave. [[South African Farmer Murders|Crime against the farming community]] has continued to be a major problem.<ref>{{cite news|

==Military==
{{main|South African National Defence Force}}
South Africa's [[armed force]]s, known as the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), was created in 1994. Previously known simply as the South African Defence Force (SADF), the new force consists of the forces of the old SADF, as well as the forces of the African nationalist groups, namely [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (MK), [[Azanian People's Liberation Army]] (APLA), and the former [[homeland]] defence forces. The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the [[South African Army]], the [[South African Air Force]], the [[South African Navy]], and the [[South African Medical Service|South African Military Health Services]].

In recent years, the SANDF has become a major [[peacekeeping]] force in Africa, and has been involved in operations in [[Lesotho]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and [[Burundi]], amongst others. It has also participated as a part of multi-national [[UN]] peacekeeping forces.

South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons program in the 1970s and [[Vela Incident|may have conducted]] a nuclear test over the [[Atlantic]] in [[1979]]. It has since renounced its nuclear program and, after destroying its small nuclear arsenal, signed the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] in [[1991]]. It is the only African country to have successfully [[South Africa and weapons of mass destruction|developed nuclear weapons]].

==Media==
{{main|Media in South Africa}}
South Africa has a large, free, and active press that regularly challenges the government, a habit formed during the apartheid era when the press was the medium least controlled by the government. Major [[scandal]]s have erupted when the press reported charges of [[political corruption|corruption]] that were proven to be true in cases such as that of [[Schabir Shaik]], in which (then) deputy president [[Jacob Zuma]] was implicated, and the corruption allegations that led to the dismissal of [[Winnie Mandela]] from parliament. The government's stance on the [[Zimbabwe parliamentary elections, 2005|2005 Zimbabwe parliamentary elections]] and [[AIDS]] have also attracted plenty of coverage.

Even though South Africa now has the most sophisticated media network in Africa, it was one of the last countries in the world to allow [[Television in South Africa|television]], with colour TV broadcasts commencing in 1975. By the end of [[apartheid]] in 1994, television networks covered all [[List of cities in South Africa|urban areas]] and some less populated areas, while radio networks covered almost all of the country.

During the Apartheid era the majority of commercial and all public-service radio stations and all of the television channels were operated by the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), and were subject to strict control and censorship by the government, with a few independent regional stations allowed. The creation of the independent black homelands (or [[Bantustan]]s) in the 1970s allowed for the establishment of TV and radio stations outside of the control of the apartheid Government. Following the demise of apartheid, the broadcasting industry was de-regulated with many of the commercial regional SABC radio stations and former Bantustan stations privatised and sold to companies and consortiums that were majority owned by black people. Three SABC television channels are in place at present.

An African language channel was introduced to the [[SABC]] in 1981 (during [[apartheid]]) with a second African language channel added later in the decade. The SABC's television monopoly was eventually challenged in 1986 when a new privately owned subscription television network, [[M-Net]], was launched. M-Net was forbidden to operate a news service.

South Africa currently has two terrestrial free-to-air television networks (SABC and [[Etv (South Africa)|e.tv]]), one subscription based terrestrial network (M-Net), as well as has access to satellite television ([[DStv]]) which is operated by M-Net's owners, Multichoice. e.tv is allowed to operate an independent television news service. The SABC broadcasts news and entertainment channels Africa-wide via satellite.
