The '''Okeechobee Hurricane''' or '''Hurricane San Felipe Segundo''' was a deadly [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]] that struck the [[Leeward Islands]], [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Bahamas]], and [[Florida]] in September of the [[1928 Atlantic hurricane season]]. It was the first recorded hurricane to reach Category 5 status on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] in the [[Atlantic basin]]; as of 2006, it remains the only recorded hurricane to strike Puerto Rico at Category 5 strength, and one of the ten most intense ever recorded to make landfall in the [[United States]].

The hurricane caused devastation throughout its path.  As many as 1,200 people were killed in [[Guadeloupe]].  Puerto Rico was struck directly by the storm at peak strength, killing at least 300 and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.  In south Florida at least 2,500 were killed when storm surge from [[Lake Okeechobee]] breached the dike surrounding the lake, flooding an area covering hundreds of square miles.  In total, the hurricane killed at least 4,078 people and caused around $100 million ($800 million in 2005 [[US dollars]]) in damages over the course of its path.

The storm was first observed 900 miles (1450 km) to the east of [[Guadeloupe]] on [[September 10]] by the ''S.S. Commack''. At the time, this was the most easterly report of a tropical cyclone ever received through ship's radio.<ref name="mwr-westindian">{{

The hurricane was also extremely large as it crossed Puerto Rico.  Hurricane-force winds were measured in [[Guayama]] for 18 hours; since the storm is estimated to have been moving at 13&nbsp;mph (21&nbsp;km/h), the diameter of the storm's hurricane winds was estimated very roughly to be 234&nbsp;miles (376&nbsp;km).<ref name="mwr-pr"/>

After leaving the Caribbean, the hurricane moved across the [[Bahamas]] as a strong [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 4 hurricane]]. It continued to the west-northwest, and made landfall in southern [[Florida]] on the evening of [[September 16]].  Atmospheric pressure at landfall was measured at 929&nbsp;mbar (hPa) and winds "in excess" of 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h).  The eye passed ashore in [[Palm Beach County]] near [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]], then moved directly over [[Lake Okeechobee]].<ref name="hurdat_1928_4"/>

The hurricane's path turned northeast as it crossed Florida, taking it across northern Florida, eastern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and the [[Carolinas]] on [[September 19]].

===Leeward Islands===
The hurricane moved directly over the [[Leeward Islands]] in the [[Caribbean]], strengthening as it did so. On the island of [[Dominica]] winds were clocked at 24 mph (39 km/h); there were no reports of damages.<ref name="mwr-westindian"/> In [[Martinique]], even further south of the storm's path, there were three fatalities.<ref name="pastdeadly"/> [[Guadeloupe]] received a near-direct hit from the storm, apparently with little warning; the death toll there was 600&ndash;1200,<ref name="pastdeadly"/> and damage reports relayed through [[Paris]] indicated "great destruction" on the island.<ref name="mwr-westindian"/>  [[Montserrat]], just north of the storm's center, was warned in advance of the storm but still suffered <U+00A3>150,000 (1928 [[UKP]]) in damages and 42 deaths; [[Plymouth, Montserrat|Plymouth]] and [[Salem, Montserrat|Salem]] were devastated and crop losses caused near-starvation conditions before relief could arrive.<ref name="Montserrat"/> The storm passed to the south of the islands of [[St. Kitts]] and [[St. Croix]], which suffered heavy damages to property and crops but no reported fatalities.<ref name="mwr-westindian"/> [[Nevis]] did report three deaths due to the storm, though.<ref name="Hubbard"/> Damage reports from elsewhere in the Leeward Islands are not available.

===Puerto Rico===
The island of [[Puerto Rico]] received the worst of the storm's winds when the hurricane moved directly across the island at [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5]] strength. The island knew of the storm's approach well ahead of time; by about 36 hours in advance all police districts were warned and radio broadcasts provided constant warnings to ships.  Effective preparation is credited for the relatively low death toll of 312, and amazingly not a single ship was lost at sea in the vicinity of Puerto Rico.  By comparison, the weaker [[1899 Hurricane San Ciriaco]] killed approximately 3,000 people.<ref name="mwr-pr"/>

Property damage on the island from winds and rain, however, was catastrophic.  The northeast half of the island received winds in excess of Category 3 strength, with hurricane-force winds lasting for as long as 18 hours. At least 10 inches (250 mm) of rain was dropped over the entire island, with much greater amounts of nearly 30 inches (750 mm) being received in some areas.  Official reports stated that "several hundred thousand" people were left homeless, and property damages were estimated at $50&nbsp;million ($400 million in 2005 [[US dollars]]).<ref name="history"/><ref name="mwr-pr"/>

The storm is remembered in Puerto Rico (and Latin America) as the [[San Felipe Hurricane]] because the eye of the cyclone made landfall on the [[Christian]] feast day of [[Saint Philip]]; the [[Latin America]]n custom, since the Spanish colonial era began in 1492, was to name hurricanes upon their arrival after Catholic religious feast days.  It was named "Segundo", Spanish for "the Second", because of another destructive "Hurricane San Felipe" which struck Puerto Rico on that very same day 52 years earlier.

===Bahamas===
The eye of the hurricane passed just south of [[Grand Bahama]] as a strong [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 4 hurricane]], again causing very heavy damage. According to a firsthand account from the island, it was the worst storm in memory to strike the area. As in Puerto Rico, however, authorities in the [[Bahamas]] were aware of the hurricane's passage well ahead of time, and preparations minimized the loss of life in the islands.  The only report of fatalities was from a [[sloop]] lost at sea in the vicinity of [[Ambergris Cay, Bahamas|Ambergris Cay]] with 18 on board.<ref name="mwr-westindian"/>

===South Florida===
Coastal damage in Florida near the point of landfall was catastrophic. [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], well south of the point of landfall, escaped with very little damage; [[Hollywood, Florida|Hollywood]] and [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]] suffered only slight damages.  Northward, from [[Pompano Beach, Florida|Pompano Beach]] to [[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter]], buildings suffered serious damage from the heavy winds and 10 ft (3 meter) storm surge, which was heaviest in the vicinity of [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]]; total coastal damages were estimated as "several million" dollars.  Because of well-issued hurricane warnings, residents were prepared for the storm, and the loss of life in the coastal Palm Beach area was only 26.<ref name="mwr-westindian">{{

Inland, the hurricane wreaked much more widespread destruction along the more heavily populated coast of [[Lake Okeechobee]].  Residents had been warned to evacuate the low ground earlier in the day, but after the hurricane did not arrive on schedule, many thought it had missed and returned to their homes.  When the worst of the storm crossed the lake &mdash; with winds measured on the ground at around 140&nbsp;[[mph]] (225&nbsp;[[km/h]]) &mdash; the south-blowing wind caused a [[storm surge]] to overflow the small dike that had been built at the south end of the lake. The resulting flood covered an area of hundreds of square miles with water that in some places was over 20&nbsp;ft (6&nbsp;m) deep. Houses were floated off of their foundations and dashed to pieces against any obstacle they encountered.<ref name="sptimes">{{

As the rear [[eyewall]] passed over the area, the flood reversed itself, breaking the dikes along the northern coast of the lake and causing a similar but smaller flood.

[[Image:1928_Okeechobee_Flood.png|thumb|right|250px|Approximate area of the flood]]

Floodwaters persisted for several weeks, greatly impeding attempts to clean up the devastation.  Burial services were quickly overwhelmed, and many of the bodies were placed into mass graves.  Around 75% of the fatalities were migrant farm workers, making identification of both dead and missing bodies very difficult; as a result of this, the count of the dead is not very accurate.  The [[Red Cross]] estimated the number of fatalities as 1,836, which was taken as the official count by the [[National Weather Service]] for many years; older sources usually list 3,411 as the total count of fatalities, including the Caribbean.  However, in 2003 this was revised as "at least" 2,500, making the Okeechobee hurricane the second-deadliest natural disaster in [[United States]] history behind the [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900]] (as of 2004).

Thousands of people were left homeless in Florida; property damage was estimated at $25&nbsp;million ($200 million in 2005 [[US dollars]]).  It is estimated that if a storm like this were to strike in modern times (the year 2003), it would cause $18.7&nbsp;billion in damages.  However, a levee breach of this kind is unlikely to occur again because of the much larger [[Herbert Hoover Dike]] that now contains the waters of Lake Okeechobee.<ref name="sptimes"/>

===Southeast and Mid-Atlantic===
Limited damage reports are available for the [[United States]] outside of southern Florida.  The storm caused flooding in [[North Carolina]] and brought near-hurricane-force winds and a 7&nbsp;foot (2.1&nbsp;m) storm surge to the [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] area.<ref>{{

==Aftermath==
{{deadliest Atlantic hurricanes|align=right}}
===Racial issues===
In [[Florida]], although the hurricane destroyed everything in its path with impartiality, the death toll was by far highest in the economically poor areas in the low-lying ground right around [[Lake Okeechobee]].  Around 75% of the fatalities were from migrant farm workers, most of whom were black.  Black workers did most of the cleanup, and the few caskets available for burials were mostly used for the bodies of whites; other bodies were either burned or buried in mass graves.  Burials were segregated, and the only mass gravesite to receive a memorial contained only white bodies.  The inequity has caused further racial friction that still exists today<!-- This wording is bad, "today" should not be used. -->.<ref>{{

===Improved building codes===
In the aftermath of the hurricane in coastal Florida, it became apparent that well-constructed buildings with shutters had suffered practically no damage from winds that caused serious structural problems to lesser buildings.  Buildings with well-constructed frames, and those made of steel, concrete, brick, or stone were largely immune to winds, and the use of shutters prevented damage to windows and the interior of the buildings.  Coming on the heels of the [[1926 Miami Hurricane]] where a similar pattern had been noticed, one lasting result of the 1928 storm was improved building codes throughout south Florida.  The result is that later storms of similar intensity, such as the [[1947 Fort Lauderdale Hurricane]], caused substantially less damage than the hurricanes of the 1920s.<ref name="mwr-westindian"/>
