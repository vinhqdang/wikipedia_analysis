'''RNA interference''' ('''RNAi''') is a system within living cells that helps to control which genes are active and how active they are. Two types of small [[RNA]] molecules <U+2013> [[microRNA]] (miRNA) and [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) <U+2013> are central to RNA interference. RNAs are the direct products of genes, and these small RNAs can bind to specific other RNAs and either increase or decrease their activity, for example by preventing a [[messenger RNA]] from producing a protein. RNA interference has an important role in defending cells against parasitic genes <U+2013> [[virus]]es and [[transposon]]s <U+2013> but also in directing [[developmental biology|development]] as well as [[gene expression]] in general.

The RNAi pathway is found in many [[eukaryote]]s including animals and is initiated by the enzyme [[Dicer]], which cleaves long [[RNA#Double-stranded_RNA|double-stranded RNA]] (dsRNA) molecules into short fragments of ~20 [[nucleotide]]s. The siRNA will be unwound into two ssRNA, namely the passenger strand and the guide strand. The passenger strand will be degraded, and the guide strand is incorporated into the [[RNA-induced silencing complex]] (RISC). The most well-studied outcome is [[post-transcriptional gene silencing]], which occurs when the guide strand base pairs with a complementary sequence of a messenger RNA molecule and induces cleavage by [[Argonaute]], the catalytic component of the RISC complex.  This process is known to spread systemically throughout the organism despite initially limited molar concentrations of siRNA.

The selective and robust effect of RNAi on gene expression makes it a valuable research tool, both in [[cell culture]] and in living organisms because synthetic dsRNA introduced into cells can induce suppression of specific genes of interest. RNAi may also be used for large-scale screens that systematically shut down each gene in the cell, which can help identify the components necessary for a particular cellular process or an event such as [[cell division]]. Exploitation of the pathway is also a promising tool in [[biotechnology]] and [[medicine]].

Historically, RNA interference was known by other names, including cosuppression, post transcriptional gene silencing, and quelling. Only after these apparently unrelated processes were fully understood did it become clear that they all described the RNAi phenomenon. In 2006, [[Andrew Fire]] and [[Craig C. Mello]] shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for their work on RNA interference in the [[nematode]] worm ''C. elegans'',<ref name="Daneholt2006">{{cite web | title=Advanced Information: RNA interference | last=Daneholt | first=Bertil | work=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2006 | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2006/adv.html | accessdate=2007-01-25}}</ref> which they published in 1998.<ref name="Fire">{{cite journal |author=Fire A, Xu S, Montgomery M, Kostas S, Driver S, Mello C |title=Potent and specific genetic interference by double-stranded RNA in ''Caenorhabditis elegans'' |journal=Nature |volume=391 |issue=6669 |pages=806<U+2013>11 |year=1998 |pmid=9486653 |doi=10.1038/35888}}</ref>

RNAi is an RNA-dependent [[gene silencing]] process that is controlled by the [[RNA-induced silencing complex]] (RISC) and is initiated by short double-stranded RNA molecules in a cell's [[cytoplasm]], where they interact with the catalytic RISC component [[argonaute]].<ref name="Daneholt2006"/> When the dsRNA is exogenous (coming from infection by a [[virus]] with an RNA genome or laboratory manipulations), the RNA is imported directly into the cytoplasm and cleaved to short fragments by the enzyme [[Dicer]]. The initiating dsRNA can also be endogenous (originating in the cell), as in pre-[[microRNA]]s expressed from [[non-coding RNA|RNA-coding gene]]s in the genome. The primary transcripts from such genes are first processed to form the characteristic [[stem-loop]] structure of pre-miRNA in the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], then exported to the cytoplasm to be cleaved by Dicer. Thus, the two dsRNA pathways, exogenous and endogenous, converge at the RISC complex.<ref name="pmid15614608">{{cite journal

[[MicroRNA]]s (miRNAs) are [[genome|genomically]] encoded [[non-coding RNA]]s that help regulate [[gene expression]], particularly during [[developmental biology|development]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wang QL, Li ZH |title=The functions of microRNAs in plants |journal=Front.

Mature miRNAs are structurally similar to siRNAs produced from exogenous dsRNA, but before reaching maturity, miRNAs must first undergo extensive [[post-transcriptional modification]]. An miRNA is expressed from a much longer RNA-coding gene as a [[primary transcript]] known as a ''pri-miRNA'' which is processed, in the [[cell nucleus]], to a 70-nucleotide [[stem-loop]] structure called a ''pre-miRNA'' by the microprocessor complex. This complex consists of an [[RNase III]] enzyme called [[Drosha]] and a dsRNA-binding protein [[Pasha]]. The dsRNA portion of this pre-miRNA is bound and cleaved by Dicer to produce the mature miRNA molecule that can be integrated into the RISC complex; thus, miRNA and siRNA share the same cellular machinery downstream of their initial processing.<ref name="Denli">{{cite journal |author=Gregory R, Chendrimada T, Shiekhattar R |title=MicroRNA biogenesis: isolation and characterization of the microprocessor complex |journal=Methods Mol Biol |volume=342 |issue= |pages=33<U+2013>47 |year=2006 |pmid=16957365 |doi=10.1385/1-59745-123-1:33}}</ref> 

The siRNAs derived from long dsRNA precursors differ from miRNAs in that miRNAs, especially those in animals, typically have incomplete base pairing to a target and inhibit the translation of many different mRNAs with similar sequences. In contrast, siRNAs typically base-pair perfectly and induce mRNA cleavage only in a single, specific target.<ref name=Pillai_2006>{{cite journal | author = Pillai RS, Bhattacharyya SN, Filipowicz W | title = Repression of protein synthesis by miRNAs: how many mechanisms? | journal = Trends Cell Biol | volume = 17| issue = 3| pages = 118<U+2013>26| year = 2007| pmid = 17197185 | doi = 10.1016/j.tcb.2006.12.007}}</ref> In ''[[Drosophila melanogaster|Drosophila]]'' and ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'', miRNA and siRNA are processed by distinct argonaute proteins and dicer enzymes.<ref name="Okamura">{{cite journal |author=Okamura K, Ishizuka A, Siomi H, Siomi M |title=Distinct roles for Argonaute proteins in small RNA-directed RNA cleavage pathways |journal=Genes Dev |volume=18 |issue=14 |pages=1655<U+2013>66 |year=2004 |pmid=15231716 |doi=10.1101/gad.1210204 |pmc=478188}}</ref><ref name="Lee">{{cite journal |author=Lee Y, Nakahara K, Pham J, Kim K, He Z, Sontheimer E, Carthew R |title=Distinct roles for Drosophila Dicer-1 and Dicer-2 in the siRNA/miRNA silencing pathways |journal=Cell |volume=117 |issue=1 |pages=69<U+2013>81 |year=2004 |pmid=15066283 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(04)00261-2}}</ref>

The mechanism by which the RITS complex induces heterochromatin formation and organization is not well understood, and most studies have focused on the [[mating-type region]] in fission yeast, which may not be representative of activities in other genomic regions or organisms. In maintenance of existing heterochromatin regions, RITS forms a complex with siRNAs [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the local genes and stably binds local methylated histones, acting co-transcriptionally to degrade any nascent pre-mRNA transcripts that are initiated by [[RNA polymerase]]. The formation of such a heterochromatin region, though not its maintenance, is dicer-dependent, presumably because dicer is required to generate the initial complement of siRNAs that target subsequent transcripts.<ref name="Noma">{{cite journal |author=Noma K, Sugiyama T, Cam H, Verdel A, Zofall M, Jia S, Moazed D, Grewal S |title=RITS acts in cis to promote RNA interference-mediated transcriptional and post-transcriptional silencing |journal=Nat Genet |volume=36 |issue=11 |pages=1174<U+2013>80 |year=2004 |pmid=15475954 |doi=10.1038/ng1452}}</ref> Heterochromatin maintenance has been suggested to function as a self-reinforcing feedback loop, as new siRNAs are formed from the occasional nascent transcripts by RdRP for incorporation into local RITS complexes.<ref name="Sugiyama">{{cite journal |author=Sugiyama T, Cam H, Verdel A, Moazed D, Grewal S |title=RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is an essential component of a self-enforcing loop coupling heterochromatin assembly to siRNA production |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=102 |issue=1 |pages=152<U+2013>7 |year=2005 |pmid=15615848 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0407641102 |pmc=544066}}</ref> The relevance of observations from fission yeast mating-type regions and centromeres to [[mammal]]s is not clear, as heterochromatin maintenance in mammalian cells may be independent of the components of the RNAi pathway.<ref name="Wang_2006">{{cite journal |author=Wang F, Koyama N, Nishida H, Haraguchi T, Reith W, Tsukamoto T |title=The assembly and maintenance of heterochromatin initiated by transgene repeats are independent of the RNA interference pathway in mammalian cells |journal=Mol Cell Biol |volume=26 |issue=11 |pages=4028<U+2013>40 |year=2006 |pmid=16705157 |doi=10.1128/MCB.02189-05 |pmc=1489094}}</ref>

===Variation among organisms===
Organisms vary in their ability to take up foreign dsRNA and use it in the RNAi pathway. The effects of RNA interference can be both systemic and heritable in plants and ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'', although not in ''[[Drosophila]]'' or [[mammal]]s. In plants, RNAi is thought to propagate by the transfer of siRNAs between cells through [[plasmodesmata]] (channels in the cell walls that enable communication and transport).<ref name=Lodish /> The heritability comes from [[DNA methylation|methylation]] of promoters targeted by RNAi; the new methylation pattern is copied in each new generation of the cell.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Jones L, Ratcliff F, Baulcombe DC| title=RNA-directed transcriptional gene silencing in plants can be inherited independently of the RNA trigger and requires Met1 for maintenance| journal=Current Biology| year=2001| volume=11| issue=10| pages=747<U+2013>757| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VRT-433PCG6-K&_user=10&_coverDate=05%2F15%2F2001&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=1e8ad684cc54f07e94776926599d292b | doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(01)00226-3 | pmid=11378384}}</ref> A broad general distinction between plants and animals lies in the targeting of endogenously produced miRNAs; in plants, miRNAs are usually perfectly or nearly perfectly complementary to their target genes and induce direct mRNA cleavage by RISC, while animals' miRNAs tend to be more divergent in sequence and induce translational repression.<ref name="Saumet" /> This translational effect may be produced by inhibiting the interactions of translation [[eukaryotic initiation factor|initiation factor]]s with the messenger RNA's [[polyadenylation|polyadenine tail]].<ref name="Humphreys">{{cite journal | author = Humphreys DT, Westman BJ, Martin DI, Preiss T | year = 2005 | title= MicroRNAs control translation initiation by inhibiting eukaryotic initiation factor 4E/cap and poly(A) tail function. | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=102 | pages=16961<U+2013>16966 | pmid = 16287976  | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0506482102 | issue = 47 | pmc = 1287990}}</ref>

===Related prokaryotic systems===
Gene expression in prokaryotes is influenced by an RNA-based system similar in some respects to RNAi.

RNA interference genes, as components of the antiviral innate immune system in many eukaryotes, are involved in an [[evolutionary arms race]] with viral genes. Some viruses have evolved mechanisms for suppressing the RNAi response in their host cells, an effect that has been noted particularly for plant viruses.<ref name="Lucy" /> Studies of evolutionary rates in ''Drosophila'' have shown that genes in the RNAi pathway are subject to strong [[directional selection]] and are among the fastest-[[evolution|evolving]] genes in the ''Drosophila'' [[genome]].<ref name="Obbard">{{cite journal |author=Obbard D, Jiggins F, Halligan D, Little T |title=Natural selection drives extremely rapid evolution in antiviral RNAi genes |journal=Curr Biol |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=580<U+2013>5 |year=2006 |pmid=16546082 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.01.065}}</ref>

==Technological applications==
===Gene knockdown===
The RNA interference pathway is often exploited in experimental biology to study the function of genes in [[cell culture]] and ''in vivo'' in [[model organism]]s.<ref name="Daneholt2006"/> Double-stranded RNA is synthesized with a sequence complementary to a gene of interest and introduced into a cell or organism, where it is recognized as exogenous genetic material and activates the RNAi pathway. Using this mechanism, researchers can cause a drastic decrease in the expression of a targeted gene. Studying the effects of this decrease can show the physiological role of the gene product. Since RNAi may not totally abolish expression of the gene, this technique is sometimes referred as a "[[Gene knockdown|knockdown]]", to distinguish it from "[[Gene knockout|knockout]]" procedures in which expression of a gene is entirely eliminated.<ref name="pmid12480342">{{cite journal

Extensive efforts in [[computational biology]] have been directed toward the design of successful dsRNA reagents that maximize gene knockdown but minimize "off-target" effects. Off-target effects arise when an introduced RNA has a base sequence that can pair with and thus reduce the expression of multiple genes at a time. Such problems occur more frequently when the dsRNA contains repetitive sequences. It has been estimated from studying the genomes of ''[[H. sapiens]]'', ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'', and ''[[S. pombe]]'' that about 10% of possible siRNAs will have substantial off-target effects.<ref name="Qiu" /> A multitude of software tools have been developed implementing [[algorithm]]s for the design of general,<ref name="Naito_ds">{{cite journal |author=Naito Y, Yamada T, Matsumiya T, Ui-Tei K, Saigo K, Morishita S |title=dsCheck: highly sensitive off-target search software for double-stranded RNA-mediated RNA interference |journal=Nucleic Acids Res |volume=33 |issue=Web Server issue |pages=W589<U+2013>91 |year=2005 |pmid=15980542 |doi=10.1093/nar/gki419 |pmc=1160180}}</ref><ref name="Henschel">{{cite journal |author=Henschel A, Buchholz F, Habermann B |title=DEQOR: a web-based tool for the design and quality control of siRNAs |journal=Nucleic Acids Res |volume=32 |issue=Web Server issue |pages=W113<U+2013>20 |year=2004 |pmid=15215362 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkh408 |pmc=441546}}</ref> mammal-specific,<ref name="Naito_si">{{cite journal |author=Naito Y, Yamada T, Ui-Tei K, Morishita S, Saigo K |title=siDirect: highly effective, target-specific siRNA design software for mammalian RNA interference |journal=Nucleic Acids Res |volume=32 |issue=Web Server issue |pages=W124<U+2013>9 |year=2004 |pmid=15215364 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkh442 |pmc=441580}}</ref> and virus-specific<ref name="Naito_virus">{{cite journal |author=Naito Y, Ui-Tei K, Nishikawa T, Takebe Y, Saigo K |title=siVirus: web-based antiviral siRNA design software for highly divergent viral sequences |journal=Nucleic Acids Res |volume=34 |issue=Web Server issue |pages=W448<U+2013>50 |year=2006 |pmid=16845046 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkl214 |pmc=1538817}}</ref> siRNAs that are automatically checked for possible cross-reactivity. 

Depending on the organism and experimental system, the exogenous RNA may be a long strand designed to be cleaved by dicer, or short RNAs designed to serve as siRNA substrates.

''C. elegans'' is particularly useful for RNAi research for two reasons: firstly, the effects of the gene silencing are generally heritable, and secondly because delivery of the dsRNA is extremely simple. Through a mechanism whose details are poorly understood, bacteria such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' that carry the desired dsRNA can be fed to the worms and will transfer their RNA payload to the worm via the intestinal tract.

RNA interference-based applications are being developed to target persistent [[HIV-1]] infection. Viruses like HIV-1 are particularly difficult targets for RNAi-attack because they are escape-prone, which requires combinatorial RNAi strategies to prevent viral escape.

===Biotechnology===
RNA interference has been used for applications in [[biotechnology]], particularly in the engineering of food plants that produce lower levels of natural plant toxins. Such techniques take advantage of the stable and heritable RNAi phenotype in plant stocks. For example, [[cotton]] seeds are rich in [[protein in nutrition|dietary protein]] but naturally contain the toxic [[terpenoid]] product [[gossypol]], making them unsuitable for human consumption. RNAi has been used to produce cotton stocks whose seeds contain reduced levels of [[delta-cadinene synthase]], a key enzyme in gossypol production, without affecting the enzyme's production in other parts of the plant, where gossypol is important in preventing damage from plant pests.<ref name="Sunilkumar">{{cite journal |author=Sunilkumar G, Campbell L, Puckhaber L, Stipanovic R, Rathore K |title=Engineering cottonseed for use in human nutrition by tissue-specific reduction of toxic gossypol |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=103 |issue=48 |pages=18054<U+2013>9 |year=2006 |pmid=17110445 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0605389103 |pmc=1838705}}</ref> Similar efforts have been directed toward the reduction of the [[cyanide|cyanogenic]] natural product [[linamarin]] in [[cassava]] plants.<ref name="Siritunga">{{cite journal |author=Siritunga D, Sayre R |title=Generation of cyanogen-free transgenic cassava |journal=Planta |volume=217 |issue=3 |pages=367<U+2013>73 |year=2003 |pmid=14520563 |doi=10.1007/s00425-003-1005-8}}</ref>

The discovery of RNAi was preceded first by observations of transcriptional inhibition by [[antisense]] RNA expressed in [[transgenic]] plants,<ref name=Ecker_1986>{{cite journal |author=Ecker JR, Davis RW |title=Inhibition of gene expression in plant cells by expression of antisense RNA |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=83 |issue=15 |pages=5372<U+2013>5376 |year=1986 | doi= 10.1073/pnas.83.15.5372 | pmid=16593734 |pmc=386288}}</ref> and more directly by reports of unexpected outcomes in experiments performed by plant scientists in the [[United States]] and the [[Netherlands]] in the early 1990s.<ref name=Napoli_1990>{{cite journal |author=Napoli C, Lemieux C, Jorgensen R |title=Introduction of a Chimeric Chalcone Synthase Gene into Petunia Results in Reversible Co-Suppression of Homologous Genes in trans |journal=Plant Cell |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=279<U+2013>289 |year=1990 |pmid=12354959 |doi=10.1105/tpc.2.4.279 |pmc=159885}}</ref> In an attempt to alter [[flower]] colors in [[petunia]]s, researchers introduced additional copies of a gene encoding [[chalcone synthase]], a key enzyme for flower [[pigmentation]] into petunia plants of normally pink or violet flower color. The overexpressed gene was expected to result in darker flowers, but instead produced less pigmented, fully or partially white flowers, indicating that the activity of chalcone synthase had been substantially decreased; in fact, both the endogenous genes and the transgenes were downregulated in the white flowers. Soon after, a related event termed ''quelling'' was noted in the [[fungus]] ''[[Neurospora crassa]]'',<ref name="Romano">{{cite journal |author=Romano N, Macino G |title=Quelling: transient inactivation of gene expression in Neurospora crassa by transformation with homologous sequences |journal=Mol Microbiol |volume=6 |issue=22 |pages=3343<U+2013>53 |year=1992 |pmid=1484489 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.1992.tb02202.x}}</ref> although it was not immediately recognized as related. Further investigation of the phenomenon in plants indicated that the downregulation was due to post-transcriptional inhibition of gene expression via an increased rate of mRNA degradation.<ref name=Van_Blokland_1994>{{cite journal | author = Van Blokland R, Van der Geest N, Mol JNM, Kooter JM | title = Transgene-mediated suppression of chalcone synthase expression in ''Petunia hybrida'' results from an increase in RNA turnover | journal = Plant J | year = 1994 | volume = 6 | pages = 861&ndash;77 | url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1046/j.1365-313X.1994.6060861.x/abs/  | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-313X.1994.6060861.x/abs/}}</ref> This phenomenon was called ''co-suppression of gene expression'', but the molecular mechanism remained unknown.<ref>{{cite book | title=Antisense nucleic acids and proteins: fundamentals and applications | author=Mol JNM, van der Krol AR| year=1991| pages=4, 136| publisher=M.

Not long after, plant [[virologist]]s working on improving plant resistance to viral diseases observed a similar unexpected phenomenon. While it was known that plants expressing virus-specific proteins showed enhanced tolerance or resistance to viral infection, it was not expected that plants carrying only short, non-coding regions of viral RNA sequences would show similar levels of protection. Researchers believed that viral RNA produced by transgenes could also inhibit viral replication.<ref name=Covey_1997>{{cite journal | author = Covey S, Al-Kaff N, L<U+00E1>ngara A, Turner D | title = Plants combat infection by gene silencing | journal = Nature | year = 1997 | volume = 385 | pages = 781&ndash;2 | doi= 10.1038/385781a0 }}</ref> The reverse experiment, in which short sequences of plant genes were introduced into viruses, showed that the targeted gene was suppressed in an infected plant. This phenomenon was labeled "virus-induced gene silencing" (VIGS), and the set of such phenomena were collectively called post transcriptional gene silencing.<ref name=Ratcliff_1997>{{cite journal | author = Ratcliff F, Harrison B, Baulcombe D| title = A Similarity Between Viral Defense and Gene Silencing in Plants | journal = Science | year = 1997 | volume = 276 | pages = 1558&ndash;60 | doi= 10.1126/science.276.5318.1558 }}</ref>

After these initial observations in plants, many laboratories around the world searched for the occurrence of this phenomenon in other organisms.<ref name="Guo">{{cite journal |author=Guo S, Kemphues K |title=par-1, a gene required for establishing polarity in C. elegans embryos, encodes a putative Ser/Thr kinase that is asymmetrically distributed |journal=Cell |volume=81 |issue=4 |pages=611<U+2013>20 |year=1995 |pmid=7758115 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(95)90082-9}}</ref><ref name="Pal-Bhadra">{{cite journal |author=Pal-Bhadra M, Bhadra U, Birchler J |title=Cosuppression in Drosophila: gene silencing of Alcohol dehydrogenase by white-Adh transgenes is Polycomb dependent |journal=Cell |volume=90 |issue=3 |pages=479<U+2013>90 |year=1997 |pmid=9267028 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80508-5}}</ref> [[Craig C. Mello]] and [[Andrew Fire]]'s 1998 ''Nature'' paper reported a potent gene silencing effect after injecting double stranded RNA into ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]''.<ref name="Fire" /> In investigating the regulation of muscle protein production, they observed that neither mRNA nor [[antisense RNA]] injections had an effect on protein production, but double-stranded RNA successfully silenced the targeted gene. As a result of this work, they coined the term ''RNAi''.  Fire and Mello's discovery was particularly notable because it represented the first identification of the causative agent for the phenomenon. Fire and Mello were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 2006 for their work.<ref name="Daneholt2006" />
