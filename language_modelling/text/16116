'''''Hot Fuzz''''' is a [[2007 in film|2007]] [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British]] police [[action film|action]]/[[comedy film]] written by [[Simon Pegg]] and [[Edgar Wright]] and starring Simon Pegg and [[Nick Frost]]. They worked together previously on the [[2004 in film|2004]] motion picture ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' and the television series ''[[Spaced]]''. It was directed by Edgar Wright and produced by [[Nira Park]]. Wright revealed that he wanted to write and direct a cop film because "there isn't really any tradition of cop films in the UK...We felt that every other country in the world had its own tradition of great cop action films and we had none."<ref name="NYP">{{cite web|title=New York Post|work="Hot Fuzz" Q&A: Flushing Birthday Cakes with Edgar Wright and Nick Frost |last=Christianson|first=Emily|url=http://www.nypost.com/entertainment/movies/news/n12889.htm|accessdate=August 7|accessyear=2007}}</ref>

Nicholas Angel, an extremely dedicated and over-achieving [[police officer]] in [[London]]'s [[Metropolitan Police Service]], performs his duties so well that he makes everyone else look bad. As a result his superiors send him to a place where his talents won<U+2019>t be quite so embarrassing: the sleepy and seemingly crime-free [[village]] of [[Sandford (Hot Fuzz)|Sandford]], where there hasn't been a recorded murder for twenty years. 

Once there, he is partnered with well-meaning but overeager and naive police constable Danny Butterman, the son of local police Inspector Frank Butterman and the late Mrs. Irene Butterman. A committed action film fan, Danny is in awe of his new big city partner, who just might provide him with his chance to experience the life of gunfights and car chases he longs for. Angel, meanwhile, struggles to adjust to the quiet and uneventful pace of the village, and despite clearing up several otherwise unnoticed [[crime]]s and [[misdemeanor]]s in short order, soon finds his most pressing concern being a [[swan]] that has escaped from its owner. Angel and Danny eventually bond over action films and drinks at the local pub.

[[Image:Fuzzswan.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sergeant Nicholas Angel and PC Danny Butterman chase an escaped swan]]
Soon after Angel's arrival, a series of grisly murders disguised as accidents rock the village, all committed by an individual in a black hood and cloak. Increasingly convinced that Sandford is not what it seems and that the victims of the 'accidents' were murdered, Angel begins to clash with the other officers on the force. However, Angel refuses to drop the [[investigation]] and initially suspects Simon "Sissy" Skinner, the charming but sinister manager of the local [[Somerfield (UK retailer)|Somerfield]] supermarket, of murdering the victims due to their involvement in a lucrative property deal. His confrontation with Skinner only reveals Skinner's apparent innocence and further damages Angel's credibility with his colleagues. 

After being ambushed in his hotel room by the cloaked murderer, who is unmasked as the trolley boy of the Somerfield supermarket acting under the instruction of Skinner, Angel is led to a nearby castle where he discovers the truth&mdash;Inspector Butterman, Skinner and the [[Neighbourhood Watch]] Alliance (NWA), intent on keeping Sandford's title of "Village of the Year", have been murdering anyone who may damage the village's image.  They've been doing it because of Danny's mother, Mrs. Butterman, who was driven over the edge when, one year, Sanford lost their title, and she died.  Angel discovers the bodies of various "problem" people whom the NWA have disposed of in the castle sewers, before being cornered and stabbed by Danny, apparently a member of the NWA.

Angel is not harmed, however; having tricked the NWA into believing that Angel is dead, Danny instead drives him to the village limits and releases him, insisting that he knew nothing about their true activities. Danny urges Angel to flee, reasoning that no one would believe the truth about Sandford. However, whilst at a rest stop Angel sees the films that he and Danny bonded over on a nearby sales rack and is inspired to stop the NWA once and for all. He drives back to town and arms himself with confiscated weapons seized earlier in the film. After Angel meets with Danny in the village, the two begin to dispatch the members of the NWA in an increasingly destructive and frantic series of gun fights. 

Initially confronted by their colleagues in the Sandford Police Service (who are quickly persuaded of the truth), Angel and Danny take the battle to the supermarket. Skinner and Inspector Butterman flee, and are pursued by Angel and Danny to a nearby model village, where both are subdued (one of whom having their jaw impaled on one of the buildings' spires). 

Although Angel's old supervisors arrive from London begging Angel to return, as their crime statistics have risen drastically, Angel elects to remain in Sandford. Back at the police station, the Sandford Police celebrate their triumph, but they are ambushed by a remaining member of the NWA. He attempts to shoot Angel but Danny jumps in front of the blast. In the resulting chaos a confiscated [[naval mine]] is triggered and the station is destroyed.

One year later, Angel lays flowers on a grave marked 'Butterman'; it is revealed that Danny has survived, and that the grave is his mother's. Angel has been promoted to Inspector and Danny to Sergeant, and the film ends as they go back on the beat together in Sandford.

==Cast==
While writing the script, Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg intended to include Nick Frost as the partner for Pegg's character. Frost revealed that he would only do the film if he could name his character, and he chose "Danny Butterman".<ref name="CinemaReview2">{{cite web | title=CinemaReview | work=Hot Fuzz-Production Notes p.2 | url=http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=4056 | accessdate=August 7| accessyear=2007}}</ref> Cast requirements included fifty people for speaking and non-speaking parts, and there were several casting calls for citizens of [[Wells]] to fill the roles,  as the village was where the majority of the filming took place.<ref name="CinemaReview2"/>

===Cameos===
British singer and actor [[Joseph McManners]] also played a cameo role as a schoolboy at the climatic battle scene of the movie, however, his background story and an entire sub-plot surrounding his character was cut from the final version and can only be found on the DVD. Stephen Merchant also makes two appearances, once as Mr Peter I Staker, who reports the escaped swan, and in a brief appearance at the end of the film when Angel is offered his job back in London. Director Edgar Wright revealed in an interview that [[Cate Blanchett]] was given her cameo role as a result of her being a fan of ''Shaun of the Dead''.<ref name="CanMag">{{cite web|title=CanMag| work=Hot Fuzz Cameos|url=http://www.canmag.com/nw/7400-hot-fuzz-wright-cameos|date=[[April 17]], [[2007]]|accessdate=August 7|accessyear=2007}}</ref> Jim Broadbent similarly revealed his interest for ''Shaun'' and requested a role while meeting with Simon Pegg at a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] awards ceremony.<ref name="BFB">{{cite web|title=BigFanBoy.com|work=Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost talk HOT FUZZ|last=Murray|first=Gary|url=http://www.bigfanboy.com/pages/interviews/hotfuzz/hf.html|accessdate=August 7|accessyear=2007}}</ref> Wright met with director [[Peter Jackson]] while he was filming ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'', and Jackson suggested that he would be willing to do a cameo in the film.

During the latter half of 2005, [[Working Title Films|Working Title]] approached several towns in [[South West England]] looking for an appropriate filming location. Simon Pegg commented "We're both from the [[West Country]] so it just seemed like it was the perfect and logical thing to drag those kind of ideas and those genres and those clich<U+00E9>s back to our beginnings to where we grew up, so you could see high-octane balls-to-the-wall action in [[Frome]]".<ref name="culture">{{cite episode | title = Week Four 2007 | series = ''The Culture Show'' | serieslink = The Culture Show|station=[[BBC 2]]|airdate=2007-02-10}}</ref> [[Stow-on-the-Wold]] was considered amongst others, but after being turned away, the company settled upon [[Wells]],<ref name="CotswoldJournal">{{cite web| title=Cotswald Journal | work=Thank God we did screen film event!| url=http://www.cotswoldjournal.co.uk/search/display.var.874709.0.thank_god_we_did_screen_film_event.php|date=[[August 11]], [[2006]]|accessdate=August 6|accessyear=2007}}</ref> Edgar Wright's hometown.

===Homage===
Wright has said that ''Hot Fuzz'' takes elements from his final amateur film, ''Dead Right'', which he described as both "''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' set in Somerset" and "a ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' film in Somerset".<ref name="comedy map">{{cite episode|title=[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedymap/episode2.shtml Episode 2 - Around the West Country and into Wales]|series=The Comedy Map of Britain|network=[[BBC 2]]|station=|city=|airdate=2007-02-03}}</ref> He uses some of the same locations in both films including the Somerfield supermarket, where he used to work as a shelf-stacker.<ref name="comedy map">{{cite episode|title=[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedymap/episode2.shtml Episode 2 - Around the West Country and into Wales]|series=The Comedy Map of Britain|network=[[BBC 2]]|airdate=2007-02-03}}</ref>

Various scenes in ''Hot Fuzz'' feature a variety of action film DVDs and scenes from ''[[Point Break]]'' and ''[[Bad Boys II]]''. Director Edgar Wright revealed that he had to get permission from the actor in each video clip to use the clips and for the use of the DVD covers had to pay for the rights from the respective studios.<ref name="MWEb">{{cite web|title=Movie Web|work=INTERVIEW: Edgar Wright Tackles Hot Fuzz|last=Chupnick|first=Steven|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/57/19157.php|date=[[April 17]], [[2007]]|accessdate=August 7|accessyear=2007}}</ref> The film parodies clich<U+00E9>s used in other action movies. On the topic of perceived gun fetishes in these movies, Pegg has said "Men can't do that thing, which is the greatest achievement of humankind, which is to make another human, so we make metal versions of our own penises and fire more bits of metal out of the end into peoples heads [...] It's our turn to grab the gun by the hilt and fire it into your face".<ref name="culture">{{cite episode|title = Week Four 2007|series=The Culture Show | serieslink = The Culture Show | station = [[BBC 2]]|airdate=2007-02-10}}</ref> Despite this, Pegg maintains that the film is not a spoof in that, "They lack the sneer that a lot of parodies have that look down on their source material. Because we're looking up to it."<ref name="EWBrit">{{cite news | author = Clark Collis | title = Brits and Giggles | publisher = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' | date = [[2007-04-13]] | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20034733,00.html | accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref>

===Effects===
Ten artists were used to develop the visual effects for the film.<ref name="VFX">{{cite web| title=VFXWorld|work=Hot Fuzz: A Cop Spoof CG Investigation|last=Bielik|first=Alain|url=http://vfxworld.com/?sa=adv&code=1e242f07&atype=articles&id=3253|date=[[April 20]], [[2007]]|accessdate=August 8|accessyear=2007}}</ref> To illustrate the destruction of the mansion as a result of the gas explosion, gas mortars were placed in front of the building to create large-scale fireballs. The wave of fire engulfs the camera, and to achieve that effect, gas mortars were used again but were fired upwards into a black ceiling piece that sloped up towards the camera.<ref name="VFX"/> When the sequence was shot at a high speed the flames appeared to surge across the ground. For one of the final scenes of the film, the Stanford police station is destroyed from an explosion. Part of the explosion was created by using a set model that showed its windows being blown out, while the building remained intact. The actual destruction of the building was depicted by exploding a miniature model of the station.<ref name="HotFuzzDVD"/>

Similar to the work in ''Shaun of the Dead'', blood and gore was prevalent throughout the film and [[visual effects]] supervisor Richard Briscoe revealed the rationale for using the large amounts of blood: "In many ways, the more extreme you make it, the more people know it is stylized and enjoy the humor inherent in how ridiculous it is. It's rather like the (eventually) limbless [[Black Knight (Monty Python)|Black Knight]] in ''[[Monty Python's Holy Grail]]''."<ref name="VFX"/> The most time-consuming sequence involving gore was for when the reporter's head is crushed by a section of a cathedral. A dummy was used against a [[bluescreen|green screen]] and the head was detonated at the point when the object was about to impact the body. Over seventy gunfight shots were digitally added throughout the film and Briscoe also stated: "The town square shootout, for example, is full of extra little hits scattered throughout, so that it feels like our hero characters really do have it all going off, all around them...It was a great demonstration of what a difference how individual, seemingly very trivial enhancements can make a difference when combined across a sequence."<ref name="VFX"/>

===Preparation and filming===
To prepare for their roles in the film, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost had to follow certain requirements. Pegg's contract stated that he had to adopt a strict diet and use three personal trainers to prepare him for the physically demanding scenes in the film. Frost was asked by Wright and Pegg to watch around twenty action films to warm him up for his role as a police officer, but he decided to only watch ''Bad Boys II''.<ref name="CinemaReview3">{{cite web | title=CinemaReview | work=Hot Fuzz-Production Notes p.3 | url=http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=4056 | accessdate=August 7| accessyear=2007}}</ref>
