'''State Route 1002''' '''(SR 1002)''', locally known as '''Tilghman Street''' and '''Union Boulevard''', is a major {{convert|13.7|mi|km|1|sp=us|lk=on|abbr=on}} long<ref name=length/> east-west [[road]] in the [[Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton metropolitan area]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]]. The majority of the roadway is the former alignment of [[U.S. Route 22 (Pennsylvania)|U.S. Route 22]], maintained by the [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation]] as a [[Quadrant Route (Pennsylvania)|Quadrant Route]], and is not signed except on small white segment markers.<ref name=LRS/>

Tilghman Street begins at [[Pennsylvania Route 100]]&nbsp;in [[Fogelsville, PA|Fogelsville]], though SR 1002&nbsp;continues west on Main Street (also old US 22) to the intersection of Church Street (SR 3014). It becomes Union Boulevard just east of the bridge over the [[Lehigh River]] in [[Allentown, PA|Allentown]]; SR 1002&nbsp;ends at the [[interchange (road)|interchange]] with [[Pennsylvania Route 378]]&nbsp;in [[Bethlehem, PA|Bethlehem]]. Union Boulevard continues over [[Monocacy Creek]], which forms the border between [[Lehigh County, PA|Lehigh]] and [[Northampton County, PA|Northampton]] Counties, and ends in downtown Bethlehem.<ref name=videolog/><ref name=lehightraffic>{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/MAPS/TR&SR_type3/lehigh_T3.pdf|title=Lehigh County Roads Map|work=PennDOT|accessdate=2007-05-11}}</ref>

==History==
When the state began taking over state highways through the [[Pennsylvania State Route|Sproul Road Bill]], signed May 31, 1911,<ref name="archives">{{cite web|url=http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/DAM/rg/sd/r12sd.htm#constructionbureau|title=Department of Highways|work=Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission|accessdate=2007-04-24}}</ref> this system did not include the direct Allentown-[[Harrisburg, PA|Harrisburg]] route that [[Interstate 78 (Pennsylvania)|Interstate 78]]&nbsp;and the parallel Tilghman Street now form part of. The main route to Harrisburg, which would soon become the [[William Penn Highway]], left Allentown further south, on Hamilton Boulevard (now [[Pennsylvania Route 222]] and [[U.S. Route 222 (Pennsylvania)|U.S. Route 222]]); the portion near Allentown was Legislative Route 157 (LR 157). Another route west from Allentown (LR 163, later [[U.S. Route 309]]) ran northwest from Allentown via Walbert Avenue to [[Schnecksville, PA|Schnecksville]]. Travelers could continue via [[New Tripoli, Pennsylvania|New Tripoli]] to [[Lenhartsville, PA|Lenhartsville]], and then along a route approximating the present I-78&nbsp;to Harrisburg. From Allentown east to downtown Bethlehem, LR 159&nbsp;used Hanover Avenue and Broad Street. No state highways existed within the city limits of Allentown.<ref>{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_PDF_FILES/Maps/Type_10_GHS_Historical_Scans/Lehigh_1915.pdf|title=1915 Lehigh County Map|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-04-24|PennDOT}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/Statewide/Historic_OTMs/1911.pdf|title=Map of Pennsylvania Showing State Highways as Adopted Under the Sproul Road Bill|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-05-03|work=PennDOT}}</ref>

The [[William Penn Highway]] was organized as an alternative to the [[Lincoln Highway]] being parallel to the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] west of Harrisburg. The route's [[New York, NY|New York]] Extension, adopted in 1916, passed through Allentown. The state assigned the [[Pennsylvania Route 3 (1920s)|Pennsylvania Route 3]]&nbsp;designation to this road in 1924, and in 1926&nbsp;it became part of [[U.S. Route 22 (Pennsylvania)|U.S. Route 22]].<ref name="fed">{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us22.htm|title=William Penn Highway: US 22 in Pennsylvania|work=Federal Highway Administration|accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref> The road west from Allentown, now College Heights Boulevard, Broadway, Tilghman Street, and Main Street, was designated LR 443&nbsp;in 1925,<ref>Public Law 191, passed April 8, 1925</ref> and soon the entire shortcut between Allentown and Harrisburg was designated [[Pennsylvania Route 43 (1920s)|Pennsylvania Route 43]].<ref name="NY times">Leon A.

Prior to 1931, there were no state highways in Allentown or a number of other major cities in the state.

=== Tilghman Street ===
[[Image:SR 1002 (LC) bridge.jpg|thumb|left|Tilghman Street Bridge.]]
SR 1002 begins at an intersection with Church and Main Streets ([[State Route 3014 (Lehigh County, Pennsylvania)|State Route 3014]]) in [[Fogelsville, Pennsylvania|Fogelsville]]. It then proceeds east for three-tenths of a mile<ref name="Delorme"/> (0.5&nbsp;km) as '''Main Street''' to an intersection with [[Pennsylvania Route 100]]. Upon crossing SR 100, SR 1002 becomes '''Tilghman Street'''. As Tilghman Street approaches the limited-access [[U.S. Route 22 (Pennsylvania)|U.S. Route 22]], the road splits into two [[carriageway]]s in preparation for an interchange with US 22, northeast of where US 22 separates from [[Interstate 78 (Pennsylvania)|Interstate 78]]. Past the interchange with US 22, Tilghman Street returns to an undivided roadway and enters the village of [[Cetronia, Pennsylvania|Cetronia]].

At an intersection with Werley Road, SR 1002 connects to [[Interstate 476]] (the Northeast Extension of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]]) via a ramp leading to the toll plaza for the nearby I-476/US 22 interchange. SR 1002 continues to the southeast, passing over the turnpike. After turning to the northeast, Tilghman Street has a [[cloverleaf interchange]] with [[Pennsylvania Route 309]]. SR 1002 enters Allentown one quarter mile west of this interchange just before its intersection with 40th Street. Tilghman Street then re-enters South Whitehall for about one block as it crosses [[Cedar Crest Boulevard]], a local north-south arterial, before entering into the city's incorporated limits for a second time.

In [[Allentown (PA)|Allentown]], Tilghman Street (SR 1002) crosses more than 30&nbsp;major streets in the city, where traffic lights give cars on Tilghman Street substantially more time to cross.<ref name="SR 1002 at 19th">{{cite map|publisher=MapQuest|url=http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?formtype=address&addtohistory=&address=%5b7700%2d7731%5d%20Main%20St&city=Fogelsville&state=PA&zipcode=18051&country=US&location=8vRL%2bp9dEO90n45YNSTvNZWoBy0%2bofL1z5HCLB8CL2ML0aT3XDl0ssMCuyGnAv4QlDtasLtyoKNPy7PKJ0XoU8n5cpyfREF0Gz6W3V2ULRTCkJy9aHSUaPmrzAjACziYMcMOf0QtROkxuyrGpwdpfQ%3d%3d&ambiguity=1#west|title=Map of Tilghman and 19th Streets|accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref><ref name="PA diners"/> In the more populated part of the city, SR 1002 intersects the 6th&nbsp;and 7th&nbsp;street [[one-way|one-way couplet]] forming [[Pennsylvania Route 145]]. East of 4th Street, the road uses the Tilghman Street Bridge<ref name=NBI/> to cross [[Jordan Creek (Pennsylvania)|Jordan Creek]] and American Parkway. After intersecting Front Street, SR 1002 crosses the [[Lehigh River]] on the Tilghman Street Viaduct and becomes Union Boulevard.<ref name=NBI/> Tilghman Street is still found in east-side Allentown, but it is not connected to SR 1002 in west-side, center city, and upper east-side Allentown.<ref name="ABE map">{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/Statewide/OTM/2007/web_ABE_enlg.pdf|title=Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton Metropolitan Map|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-04-11|work=PennDOT}}</ref>

=== Union Boulevard ===
East of the Tilghman Street Viaduct, SR 1002 traverses numerous streets in the eastern section of [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]]. After the intersection with Fenwick Street, SR 1002&nbsp;has a solid west-east routing. East of the Irving Street intersection, SR 1002&nbsp;intersects Airport Road, the main road to [[Lehigh Valley International Airport]]. Briefly east of Airport Road, Union Boulevard traverses the other streets of east Allentown. SR 1002&nbsp;enters the city of [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]] from the west as West Union Boulevard.

Approximately 1,500&nbsp;feet<ref name="Delorme"/> east of the Allentown-Bethlehem boundary, Eaton Avenue is concurrent with SR 1002&nbsp; for one-tenth of a mile.<ref name="Delorme"/><ref name="ABE map"/> The route turns to the south near the junction with Pennsylvania Avenue before taking an increasingly eastern alignment.<ref name="ABE map"/> Third Avenue provides access to and from [[Pennsylvania Route 378|PA 378]]&nbsp;south.
