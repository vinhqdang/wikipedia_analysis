[[Image:NK-Map.PNG|thumb|right|305px|Nagorno-Karabakh is currently a ''[[de facto]]'' independent republic in the [[South Caucasus]], but is officially recognized as part of the Republic of Azerbaijan.]]

The '''Nagorno-Karabakh War''' refers to the armed conflict that took place from [[February 1988]] to [[May 1994]], in the small ethnic [[enclave]] of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] {{fn|(I)}} in southwestern [[Azerbaijan]], between the predominantly ethnic [[Armenian people|Armenian]]s of Nagorno-Karabakh backed by the [[Republic of Armenia]] against the Republic of Azerbaijan. As the war progressed, Armenia and Azerbaijan, both former [[Soviet Republics]], became enveloped in a protracted, undeclared [[mountain warfare|war in the mountainous heights]] of Karabakh as Azerbaijan attempted to curb a [[secession]]ist movement in Nagorno-Karabakh. The enclave's [[parliament]] had voted in favor of uniting itself with Armenia and a referendum was held with the vast majority of the Karabakh population voting in favor of independence. The demand to unify with Armenia, which proliferated in the late 1980s, began in a relatively peaceful manner; however, in the following months, as the [[Soviet Union]]'s disintegration neared, it gradually grew into an increasingly violent conflict between the two ethnic groups, resulting in claims of [[ethnic cleansing]] by all sides.<ref name=CASE-STUDY-IN-ETHNIC-STRIFE>{{cite web

The war was the most destructive ethnic conflict in both terms of lives and property that emerged after the Soviet Union collapsed in December 1991.<ref>The casualties of the war are conflicting and exact numbers are unknown due to the fact that exact body counts were never properly ascertained by either side or by international organizations. In the initial years of combat, casualties were reported to be much lower than what was later asserted after the war ended. Most sources however place the figures near 25<U+2013>35,000. Time Magazine, for example lists the number as at least 35,000 people on both sides [http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,990805,00.html]. The [[US State Department]] [http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2909.htm] and [[NPR]] [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5357869] put the numbers slightly lower at around 30,000. There have been subsequent casualties which resulted from the tripping of land mines, often by civilians. Numerous cease fire violations on the borders also result in the deaths of several soldiers each year. Other ethnic conflicts with comparative casualties included the [[First Chechen War]] and the civil war in Georgia.</ref> Inter ethnic fighting between the two broke out shortly after the parliament of Nagorno-Karabakh, an [[autonomous oblast]] in Azerbaijan, voted to unify the region with Armenia on [[February 20]], [[1988]]. The declaration of seceding from Azerbaijan was the final result of a "long-standing resentment in the Armenian community of Nagorno Karabakh against serious limitations of its cultural and religious freedom by central Soviet and Azerbaijani authorities",<ref>{{cite book

Along with the secessionist movements in the [[Baltic States|Baltic]] republics of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]], the succeeding movement characterized and played a large role in bringing the downfall of the Soviet Union. As Azerbaijan declared its independence from the Soviet Union and removed the powers held by the enclave's government, the Armenian majority voted to secede from Azerbaijan, and in the process proclaimed the enclave the [[Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh]].

Full-scale fighting erupted in the late winter of 1992. International mediation by several groups including Europe's [[OSCE]] failed to bring an end resolution that both sides could work with. In the spring of 1993, Armenian forces captured regions outside the enclave itself, threatening the involvement of other countries in the region. By the end of the war in 1994, the Armenians were in full control of not only the enclave but also held and currently control approximately 9% of Azerbaijan's territory outside the enclave.<ref>Using numbers provided by journalist [[Thomas de Waal]] for the area of each rayon as well as the area of the Nagorno Karabakh Oblast and the total area of Azerbaijan are (in [[square kilometre]]s):

== Background ==
{{main|History of Nagorno-Karabakh}}
The territorial ownership of Nagorno-Karabakh today is still a heavily disputed issue between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Called  [[Artsakh]] by Armenians, its history spans several centuries, where it came under the control of several empires. Debate, however, is mired mainly in the aftermath of [[World War I]]. Shortly before the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s capitulation in the war, the [[Russian Empire]] collapsed in November 1917 and fell under the control of the [[Bolsheviks]]. The three nations of the [[Caucasus]], Armenia, Azerbaijan, and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], previously under the rule of the Russians, declared their independence to form the [[Transcaucasian Federation]] which dissolved after only three months of existence.<ref name="dewaal"/>

===Armenian-Azerbaijani war===
{{main|Armenian-Azerbaijani war (1918 - 1920)}}
Fighting soon broke out between the [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]] and the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan]] in three specific regions: [[Nakhichevan]], Zangezur (today the Armenian province of [[Syunik]]), and Karabakh itself. Armenia and Azerbaijan quarreled as to where the boundaries would fall in accordance to the three provinces. The Karabakh Armenians attempted to declare their independence but failed to make contact with the Republic of Armenia.<ref name="dewaal"/> After the defeat of [[Ottoman empire]] in [[World War I]], British troops occupied the [[South Caucasus]] in 1919. The British command provisionally affirmed Khosrov bey Sultanov (an appointee of the Azerbaijan government) as the governor-general of Karabakh and Zangezur, pending a final decision by the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]].<ref>Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the ROA.

Retrieved [[March 2]], [[2007]].</ref>

=== Soviet division ===
Two months later however, the [[Soviet 11th Army]] invaded the Caucasus and within three years, the Caucasian republics were formed into the [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] of the Soviet Union. The Bolsheviks thereafter created a seven-member committee, the [[Caucasus Bureau]] (often shortened to ''Kavburo''), which under the supervision of the future Soviet ruler [[Joseph Stalin]], the [[Narkomnats|People's Commissar for Nationalities]], was tasked to head up matters in the Caucasus.<ref name="Karagiannis">{{cite book

These factors led the committee to reverse its decision and award Karabakh to Soviet Azerbaijan in 1921, and later incorporated the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] (NKAO) within the [[Azerbaijan SSR]] in 1923,<ref name="dewaal"/> leaving it with a population that was 94% Armenian.<ref>{{cite book

==February 1988, the revival of the Karabakh issue==
As the new [[general secretary]] of the Soviet Union, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], came to power in 1985, he began implementing his plans to reform the Soviet Union. These were encapsulated in two policies, ''[[perestroika]]'' and ''[[glasnost]]''. While ''perestroika'' had more to do with economic reform, ''glasnost'' or "openness" granted limited freedom to Soviet citizens to express grievances about the Soviet system itself and its leaders. Capitalizing on this, the leaders of the Regional Soviet of Karabakh decided to vote in favor of unifying the autonomous region with Armenia on [[February 20]], [[1988]].<ref>{{cite book

The movement was spearheaded by popular Armenian figures and also members of the Russian [[intelligentsia]], such as the dissident and [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Andrei Sakharov]]. Prior to the declaration, Armenians had begun to protest and stage workers' [[Strike action|strikes]] in Yerevan, demanding a unification with the enclave. This prompted Azeri counter-protests in [[Baku]]. In reaction to the protests, Gorbachev stated that the borders between the republics would not change, in accordance with Article 78 of the [[1977 Soviet Constitution|Soviet constitution]].<ref name="Rost">{{cite book

===Sumgait===
{{main|Sumgait Pogrom}}
[[Image:Sumgaitrioting.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Images showing burnt automobiles and marauding rioters on the streets of the industrial city of [[Sumgait]] during the [[Sumgait Massacre|pogrom there]] in February 1988.]]
Ethnic infighting soon broke out between Armenians and Azerbaijanis living in Karabakh. On [[February 22]], [[1988]], a [[Askeran clash|direct confrontation]] between Azerbaijanis and Armenians near Askeran (in Nagorno-Karabakh, on the [[Stepanakert]]<U+2013>[[Agdam]] road) degenerated into a skirmish. During the clashes, which left about 50 Armenians wounded, a local policeman, purportedly  an Armenian, shot dead two Azerbaijani youths. On [[February 27]], [[1988]], while speaking on Baku's central television, the [[Public Procurator|Soviet Deputy Procurator]] Alexander Katusev mentioned the nationality of those killed. 

Within hours, a [[pogrom]] against Armenian residents began in the city of Sumgait, 25 kilometers north of Baku, where many [[Azeris in Armenia|Azerbaijani refugees from Armenia]] resided, resulting in the deaths of 32 people, according to official Soviet statistics.<ref>The official Soviet statistics on Sumgait were initially placed much lower but incrementally rose to a final count of 32 dead and several hundred injured, most of them Armenian but also including several Azeris who were possibly killed when some Armenians resisted and fought back. Many Armenians feel the figures by the Soviet media are understated and were in fact much higher. Nearly the entire Armenian population in Sumgait left Azerbaijan after the pogrom.</ref> Armenians were beaten, raped and killed both on the streets of Sumgait and inside their apartments in three days of violence that was only put down when Soviet armed forces entered the city and quelled much of the rioting on [[March 1]].<ref>{{cite book

The manner of which many Armenians were killed reverberated amongst Armenians who felt the pogrom was backed by government officials to intimidate those involved in the Karabakh movement. Violence slowly began to escalate after Sumgait as Gorbachev finally decided to send in Soviet [[Internal Troops|Interior troops]] to Armenia in [[September 1988]]. By [[October 1989]], over 100 people were estimated to have been killed since the revived idea of unification with Karabakh in February 1988.<ref>{{cite news

''My Brother's Road'', p. 163.</ref> 

Gorbachev's attempts to stabilize the region were to no avail, as both sides were equally intransigent. Armenians refused to allow the issue to subside despite concessions made by Gorbachev, including a promise of a 400 million rubles package to introduce Armenian language textbooks and television programming in Karabakh. At the same time, Azerbaijan was unwilling to cede any territory to Armenia. Furthermore, the newly formed [[Karabakh Committee]], which comprised eleven members including the future president of Armenia [[Levon Ter-Petrossian]], were jailed by Moscow officials in the ensuing chaos after the quake. Such actions polarized relations between Armenia and the [[Kremlin]]; Armenians lost faith in Gorbachev and despised him even more because of his mishandling of the earthquake and his uncompromising stance in regards to Nagorno-Karabakh.<ref name="MakingofNK">{{cite book

===Black January===
{{main|Black January}}
Inter-ethnic strife began to take a toll on both countries' populations, forcing most of the Armenians in Azerbaijan to flee back to Armenia and most of the Azeris in Armenia to Azerbaijan.<ref name="Croissant"/> The situation in Nagorno-Karabakh had grown so out of hand that in January 1989 the central government in Moscow temporarily took control of the region, a move welcomed by many Armenians.<ref name="dewaal"/> In the summer of 1989, [[Azerbaijan Popular Front|Popular Front]] leaders and their ever-increasing supporters managed to pressure the Azerbaijan SSR to instigate a [[railway]] and [[air]] [[blockade]] against Armenia, effectively crippling Armenia's economy, as 85% of the cargo and goods arrived through rail traffic (this also cut off Nakhichevan from the rest of the Soviet Union).<ref name="Croissant"/> The disruption of rail service to Armenia was in part due to the attacks of Armenian militants on Azerbaijani train crews entering Armenia, who then began refusing to do so.<ref name="Kaufman"/>

In January 1990, another pogrom against Armenians in Baku forced Gorbachev to declare a state of emergency and sent [[MVD]] troops to restore order. A curfew was established and violent clashes between the soldiers and the surging [[Azerbaijan Popular Front]] were common, in one instance over 120 Azeris and eight MVD soldiers were killed in Baku.<ref>

=== Operation Ring ===
{{main|Operation Ring}}
In the spring of 1991, President Gorbachev held a special countrywide referendum called the [[Union of Soviet Sovereign Republics|Union Treaty]] which would decide if the Soviet republics would remain together. Newly elected, non-communist leaders had come to power in the Soviet republics, including [[Boris Yeltsin]] in Russia (Gorbachev remained the [[President of the Soviet Union]]), Levon Ter-Petrossian in Armenia and [[Ayaz Mutalibov]] in Azerbaijan. Armenia and five other republics boycotted the referendum (Armenia would hold its own referendum and declared its independence from the [[Soviet Union]] on [[September 21]], [[1991]]), whereas Azerbaijan voted in compliance to the Treaty.<ref name="Croissant"/> 

As many Armenians and Azeris in Karabakh began an arms build up (by acquiring weaponry located in caches throughout Karabakh) in order to defend themselves, Mutalibov touted support from Gorbachev in launching a joint military operation (in this case, by the Azerbaijani [[OMON]] special squads of the [[militsiya]]) in order to disarm Armenian militants in the region. Known as [[Operation Ring]], the operation forcibly deported Armenians living in villages in the region of [[Shahumian|Shahumyan]]. It was perceived by both Soviet officials from the Kremlin and from the Armenian government as a method of intimidating the Armenian populace to giving up their demands for unification.<ref name="Croissant"/>

The operation proved counter-productive to what it had originally sought to accomplish. The initial Armenian resistance inspired volunteers who flocked from Armenia, and only reinforced the belief among Armenians that the only solution to the Karabakh conflict was through outright armed conflict.<ref name="dewaal"/> [[Monte Melkonian]], an [[Armenian-American]] who had served in revolutionary groups in the 1980s and would later rise to be perhaps the most famed commander of the war, argued that Karabakh be "liberated" and contended that if it remained in Azeri hands, the region of [[Syunik]] would then be annexed by the Azeris and the rest of Armenia would follow thereafter, concluding that "the loss of Artsakh could be the loss of Armenia."<ref name="brothersroad">{{cite book

As the disintegration of the Soviet Union became a reality for Soviet citizens in the autumn of 1991, both sides sought to acquire weaponry from military caches located throughout Karabakh. The initial advantage tilted in Azerbaijan's favor. During the [[Cold War]], the Soviet military doctrine for defending the Caucasus had outlined a strategy where Armenia would be a combat zone in the case [[NATO]] member Turkey invaded from the west. Thus, in the Armenian SSR only three [[Division (military)|division]]s and no [[airfields]] had been established while the Azeri SSR had a total of five divisions and five military airfields. Furthermore, Armenia had approximately 500 [[railroad cars]] of [[ammunition]] in comparison to Azerbaijan's 10,000.<ref>Petrosian, David. ''"What Are the Reasons for Armenians' Success in the Military Phase of the Karabakh Conflict?"'' Noyan Tapan Highlights. [[June 1]], [[2000]]</ref> 

As MVD forces began pulling out, they bequeathed the Armenians and Azerbaijanis a vast arsenal of ammunition and stored [[armor]]ed vehicles. The government forces initially sent by Gorbachev three years earlier were from other republics of the Soviet Union and many had no wish to remain any longer. Most were poor, young [[conscript]]s and many simply sold their weapons for cash or even vodka to either side, some even trying to sell tanks and [[armored personnel carrier]]s (APCs). The unsecured weapons caches led both sides to blame and mock Gorbachev's policies as the ultimate cause of the conflict.<ref name="timestepanakert">

Further evidence also showed that Azerbaijan received substantial military aid and provisions from [[Iran]], [[Turkey]] and numerous [[Arab]] countries.<ref name="brothersroad" /> Most weaponry was Russian-made or came from the former [[Eastern bloc]] countries however some improvisation was made by both sides. The [[Armenian Diaspora]] managed to donate a significant amount of money to be sent to Armenia and even managed to push for legislation in the [[United States Congress]] to pass a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] entitled Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act in response to Azerbaijan's blockade against Armenia; restricting a complete ban on military aid from the United States to Azerbaijan in 1992.<ref>[http://www.wws.princeton.edu/wws401c/1998/907.html Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act]. Humanitarian aid was not explicitly banned but such supplies had to be routed through indirectly to aid organizations. On [[January 25]] [[2002]], President [[George W. Bush]] signed a waiver that effectively repealed Section 907; thereby removing any restrictions that were barring the United States from sending military aid to Azerbaijan; however, military parity is maintained towards both sides. For more information, see here [http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/01/20020130-6.html]. Azerbaijan continues to maintain their road and air blockade against Armenia.</ref> While Azerbaijan charged that the Russians were initially helping the Armenians, it was said that "the Azeri fighters in the region [were] far better equipped with Soviet military weaponry than their opponents."<ref name="timestepanakert"/>

With Gorbachev resigning as Soviet General-Secretary on [[December 26]], 1991, the remaining republics including the [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]] and [[Russia]] declared their independence and the Soviet Union ceased to exist on [[December 31]], [[1991]].  This dissolution gave way to any barriers that were keeping Armenia and Azerbaijan from waging a full scale war.  One month prior, on [[November 21]], the Azerbaijani Parliament rescinded Karabakh's status as an autonomous oblast and renamed its capital "Xankandi".  In response, on [[December 10]], a referendum was held in Karabakh by parliamentary leaders (with the local Azeri community boycotting it) where the Armenians voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence. On [[January 6]] 1992, the region declared its independence from Azerbaijan.<ref name="Croissant"/> 

The withdrawal of the Soviet interior forces from Nagorno-Karabakh in the Caucasus region was only temporary.  By February 1992, the former Soviet states consolidated as the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS).  While Azerbaijan abstained from joining, Armenia, fearing a possible invasion by Turkey in the escalating conflict, entered the CIS which would have protected it under a "collective security umbrella".  In January 1992, the CIS forces then moved in and established a headquarters at Stepanakert and took up a slightly more active role in peacekeeping, incorporating old units including the 366<sup>th</sup> Motorized Rifle Regiment and [[Soviet Fourth Army|4<sup>th</sup> Army]].<ref name="Karagiannis"/>

==Building armies==

The sporadic battles between Armenians and Azeris had intensified after Operation Ring recruited thousands of volunteers into improvised armies from both Armenia and Azerbaijan. In Armenia, a recurrent and popular theme at the time compared and idolized the separatist fighters to historical Armenian [[guerrilla]] groups and revered individuals such as [[Andranik Ozanian]] and [[Garegin Njdeh]], who fought against the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref name="dewaal"/>  In addition to the government's conscription of males aged 18<U+2013>45, many Armenians volunteered to fight and formed ''tchokats'', or detachments, of about forty men, which combined with several others were under the command of a [[Lieutenant Colonel]]. Initially, many of these men chose when and where to serve and acted on their own behalf, rarely without any oversight, when attacking or defending areas.<ref name="brothersroad"/> Direct insubordination was common as many of the men simply did not show up, looted the bodies of dead soldiers, and commodities such as diesel oil for armored vehicles disappeared only to be sold in black markets.<ref name="brothersroad"/> 

Many women enlisted in the Armenian military; however, they more often served in auxiliary roles such as providing [[first-aid]] and evacuating wounded men from the battlefields than taking part in the fighting. Azerbaijan's military functioned in much the same manner; however, it was better organized during the first years of the war. The Azeri government also carried out conscription and many Azeris enthusiastically enlisted for combat in the first months after the Soviet Union collapsed.  Azerbaijan's National Army consisted of roughly 30,000 men, in addition to nearly 10,000 in its OMON paramilitary force and several thousand volunteers from the Popular Front. [[Suret Huseynov]], a wealthy Azeri, also improvised by creating his own military brigade, the 709<sup>th</sup> of the Azerbaijani Army, and purchasing many weapons and vehicles from the 23rd Motor Rifle Division's arsenal.<ref name="dewaal"/> [[<U+0130>sgandar Hamidov]]'s ''bozkurt'' or [[Grey Wolves]] brigade also mobilized for action. The government of Azerbaijan also poured a great deal of money into hiring mercenaries from other countries through the revenue it was making from its [[oil field]] assets on and near the [[Caspian Sea]].<ref name="Gurdelik">

Former troops of the Soviet Union also offered their services to either side. For example, one of the most prominent officers to serve on the Armenian side was former Soviet General Anatoly Zinevich, who remained in Nagorno-Karabakh for five years (1992 <U+2013> 1997) and was involved in planning and implementation of many operations of the Armenian forces.

In an overall military comparison, the number of men eligible for military service in Armenia, in the age group of 17<U+2013>32, totaled 550,000, while in Azerbaijan it was 1.3 million. Most men from both sides had served in the [[Soviet Army]] and so had some form of military experience prior to the conflict.

Officially the newly created [[Republic of Armenia]] publicly denied any involvement in providing any [[weapons]], [[fuel]], [[food]], or other [[logistics]] to the secessionists in Nagorno-Karabakh. However, Ter-Petrossian later did admit to supplying them with logistical supplies and paying the salaries of the separatists but denied sending any of its own men to combat.

The region's only airport was in the small town of [[Khojaly]], which was seven kilometers north of Stepanakert with an estimated population of 6,000<U+2013>10,000 people. Additionally, Khojaly had been serving as an artillery base and since [[February 23]], was shelling Armenian and Russian units in the capital.<ref name="Kaufman"/> By late February, Khojaly had largely been cut off. On [[February 26]], Armenian forces, with the aid of armored vehicles in the 366<sup>th</sup>, mounted an offensive to capture Khojaly.

According to the Azeris and the affirmation of other sources including [[Human Rights Watch]] and the Moscow based human rights organization [[Memorial (society)|Memorial]], after Armenian forces captured Khojaly, they proceeded to massacre several hundred [[civilians]] evacuating from the town. Armenian forces had previously stated they would attack the city and left a land [[corridor]] for them to escape through. However, when the attack began, the attacking Armenian force easily outnumbered and overwhelmed the defenders who along with the civilians attempted to retreat north to the Azeri held city of Agdam. The airport's runway was found to have been intentionally destroyed, rendering it temporarily useless. The attacking forces then went on to pursue those fleeing through the corridor and opened fire upon them, killing scores of civilians.<ref>As one survivor put it, Armenian forces, continued to "just [shoot] and [shoot] and [shoot]: Melkonian.

A report published in 1992 by the human rights organization [[Helsinki Watch]] however stated that their inquiry found that the Azerbaijani [[OMON]] and "the militia, still in uniform, and some still carrying their guns, were interspersed with the masses of civilians" which may have been the reason why Armenian troops fired upon them.<ref name="Denber">Denber R.

=== The capture of Shusha === 
{{main|Battle of Shusha}}
[[Image:Damage to Stepanakert.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Armenian children standing next to the rubble of a building in Stepanakert after a shelling barrage.]]
The aftermath of the Khojaly attack erupted in Azerbaijan. Mutalibov was called to step down from his post by many who charged that he failed to protect the civilians in Khojaly and forced to resign amid the hail of criticism on [[March 6]]. In the ensuing months after the capture of Khojaly, Azeri commanders holding out in the region's last bastion of [[Shusha]] began a large scale artillery bombardment with GRAD rocket launchers against Stepanakert. By April, the shelling had forced many of the 50,000 people living in Stepanakert to seek refuge in underground bunkers and basements.<ref name="timestepanakert"/> Facing ground incursions near the city's outlying areas, military leaders in Nagorno-Karabakh organized an offensive to take the town.

On [[May 8]], a force of several hundred Armenian troops accompanied by tanks and helicopters attacked the Shusha citadel. Fierce fighting took place in the town's streets and several hundred men were killed on both sides. Overwhelmed by the numerically superior fighting force, the Azeri commander in Shusha ordered a retreat and fighting ended on [[May 9]].<ref name="brothersroad"/>

The capture of Shusha resonated loudly in neighboring Turkey. Its relations with Armenia had grown better after it had declared its independence from the Soviet Union; however they gradually worsened as a result of Armenia's gains in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. A deep resentment towards Turkey by Armenia predated the Soviet era and this enmity stemmed in part from the [[Armenian Genocide]].<ref name="MakingofNK"/> Many Armenians collectively referred to Azeris as "Turks" since they are considered ethnic cousins. Turkey's prime minister, [[Suleyman Demirel]] said that he was under intense pressure by his people to have his country intervene and aid Azerbaijan. Demirel however, was opposed to such an intervention, saying that Turkey's entrance into the war would trigger an even greater Muslim-Christian conflict (Turks are predominantly Muslims).<ref>{{cite book

Turkey never did actively contribute troops to Azerbaijan but did send a great deal of military aid and advisers. In May 1992, the military commander of the CIS forces, Marshal [[Yevgeny Shaposhnikov]], issued a warning to Western nations, especially the United States, to not interfere with the conflict in the Caucasus; stating it would "place us [the Commonwealth] on the verge of a third world war, and that cannot be allowed."<ref name="Croissant"/>

A [[Chechnya|Chechen]] contingent, led by [[Shamil Basayev]], was one of the units to participate in the conflict. According to Azeri Colonel Azer Rustamov, in 1992, "hundreds of Chechen volunteers rendered us invaluable help in these battles led by Shamil Basayev and Salman Raduev." Basayev was said to be one of the last fighters to leave Shusha. Basayev later said during his career, he and his battalion had only lost once, and that defeat came in Karabakh in fighting against the "[[Dashnak]] battalion". He later said he pulled his ''mujahideen'' out of the conflict when the war seemed to be more for nationalism than for ''[[jihad]]''. During the conflict, Basayev was first introduced to [[Amir Ibn Khattab]].<ref name=TERROR-IN-KARABAKH>{{cite news

The loss of Shusha led the Azeri parliament to lay the blame on Mamedov, which removed him from power and cleared Mutalibov of any responsibility after the loss of Khojaly; reinstating him as President on [[May 15]] 1992. Many Azeris saw this act as a [[coup]] in addition to the cancellation of the parliamentary elections slated in June of that year. The Azeri parliament at that time was made up of former leaders from the country's communist regime and the losses of Khojaly and Shusha only aggrandized their desires for free elections.<ref name="Croissant"/>

To contribute to the turmoil, an offensive was launched by Armenian forces on [[May 18]] to take the city of [[Lachin]] in the narrow corridor separating Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. The city itself was poorly guarded and, within the next day, Armenian forces took control of the town and cleared any remaining Azeris to open the road that linked the region to Armenia. The taking of the city then allowed an overland route to be connected with Armenia itself with supply convoys beginning to trek up the mountainous region of Lachin to Karabakh.<ref name="Crossroads">{{cite book

The loss of Lachin was the final blow to Mutalibov's regime. Demonstrations were held despite Mutalibov's ban and an armed coup was staged by Popular Front activists. Fighting between government forces and Popular Front supporters escalated as the political opposition seized the parliament building in Baku as well as the airport and presidential office. On [[June 16]], [[1992]], [[Abulfaz Elchibey]] was elected leader of Azerbaijan with many political leaders from the [[Azerbaijan Popular Front Party]] were elected into the parliament. The instigators characterized Mutalibov as an undedicated and weak leader in the war in Karabakh. Elchibey was staunchly against receiving any help from the Russians, instead favoring closer ties to Turkey.<ref>{{cite book

==Escalation of the conflict==
===Operation Goranboy===
On [[June 12]] [[1992]], the Azeri military, along with Huseynov's own brigade, used a large amount of tanks, armored personnel carriers and attack helicopters to launch Operation ''Goranboy'', a large three-day offensive from the relatively unguarded region of [[Shahumyan]], north of Nagorno-Karabakh, in the process taking back several dozen villages in the Shahumyan region originally held by Armenian forces. Another reason the front collapsed so effortlessly was because it was manned by the volunteer detachments from Armenia which had abandoned the lines to go back to their country after the capture of Lachin.<ref name="dewaal"/> The offensive prompted the Armenian government to openly threaten Azerbaijan that it would overtly intervene and assist the separatists fighting in Karabakh.<ref>{{cite news

The assault forced Armenian forces to retreat south towards Stepanakert where Karabakh commanders contemplated destroying a vital [[hydroelectric]] [[dam]] in the [[Martakert]] region if the offensive was not halted. An estimated 30,000 Armenian refugees were also forced to flee to the capital as the assaulting forces had taken back nearly half of Nagorno-Karabakh. However, the thrust made by the Azeris grounded to a halt when their armor was driven off by helicopter gunships.<ref name="dewaal"/> It was claimed that many of the crew members of the armored units in the Azeri launched assault were Russians from the 104<sup>th</sup> Guards [[VDV|Airborne]] Division based out of Ganja and, ironically enough, so were the units who eventually stopped them. According to an Armenian government official, they were able to persuade Russian military units to bombard and effectively halt the advance within a few days. This allowed the Armenian government to recuperate for the losses and reorganize a [[counteroffensive]] to restore the original lines of the front.<ref name="dewaal"/>

===Attempts to mediate peace===
In the summer of 1992, the [[CSCE]] (later to become the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]), created the [[OSCE Minsk Group|Minsk Group]] in [[Helsinki]] which was comprised of eleven nations and was co-chaired by [[France]], Russia, and the United States with the purpose of mediating a peace deal with Armenia and Azerbaijan. However, in their annual summit in 1992, the organization failed to address and solve the many new problems that had arisen since the Soviet Union collapsed, much less the Karabakh conflict. The war in [[Yugoslavia]], [[Moldova]]'s war with the breakaway republic of [[Transnistria]], the growing desire for independence from Russia by [[Chechnya|Chechen]] separatists, and Georgia's renewed disputes with Russia, [[Abkhazia]] and [[Ossetia]] were all top agenda issues that involved various ethnic groups fighting each other.<ref>{{cite book

The CSCE proposed the use of NATO and CIS [[peacekeepers]] to monitor cease-fires and protect shipments of humanitarian aid being sent to displaced refugees. Several cease fires were put into effect after the June offensive but the implementation of a European peacekeeping force, endorsed by Armenia, never came to fruition. The idea of sending 100 international observers to Karabakh was once raised but talks broke down completely between Armenian and Azeri leaders in July. Russia was especially opposed to allowing a multinational peacekeeping force from NATO to entering the Caucasus, seeing it as a move that encroached on its "backyard".<ref name="Croissant"/>

===Renewed fighting===

{{main|Mardakert and Martuni Offensives}}
In late June, a new, smaller Azeri offensive was planned, this time against the town of [[Martuni]] in the southeastern half of Karabakh. The attack force consisted of several dozen tanks and armored fighting vehicles along with a compliment of several infantry companies massing along the Majgalashen and Jardar fronts near Martuni and Krasnyi Bazar. Martuni's regimental commander, Monte Melkonian, referred now by his men as "Avo", although lacking heavy armor, managed to stave off repeated attempts by the Azeri forces<ref name="brothersroad"/>

In late [[August 1992]], Nagorno-Karabakh's government found itself in a disorderly state and its members resigned on [[August 17]]. Power was subsequently assumed by a council called the State Defense Committee which was chaired by [[Robert Kocharyan]], stating it would temporarily govern the enclave until the conflict ended.<ref name="dewaal"/> At the same time, Azerbaijan also launched attacks by fixed wing aircraft, often bombing civilian targets. Kocharyan condemned what he believed were intentional attempts to kill civilians by the Azeris and also Russia's alleged passive and unconcerned attitude towards allowing its army's weapons stockpiles to be sold or transferred to Azerbaijan.<ref>{{cite news

===Winter thaw===
As the winter of 1992 approached, both sides largely abstained from launching full scale offensives so as to reserve resources, such as gas and electricity, for domestic use. Despite the opening of an economic highway to the residents living in Karabakh, both Armenia and the enclave suffered a great deal due to the economic blockades imposed by Azerbaijan. While not completely shut off, material aid sent through Turkey arrived sporadically.<ref name="Croissant"/>

Experiencing both food shortages and power shortages, after the close down of the [[Metsamor]] nuclear power plant, Armenia's economic outlook appeared bleak: in Georgia, a new bout of civil wars against separatists in Abkhazia and Ossetia began, who raided supply convoys and repeatedly destroyed the only oil pipeline leading from Russia to Armenia. Similar to the winter of 1991<U+2013>1992, the 1992<U+2013>1993 winter was especially cold, as many families throughout Armenia and Karabakh were left without heating and hot water.<ref name="Leonidas">{{cite book

Other goods such as grain were more difficult to procure. The international Armenian Diaspora raised money and donated supplies for Armenia. In December, two shipments of 33,000 tons of grain and 150 tons of infant formula arrived from the United States via the [[Black Sea]] port of [[Batumi]], Georgia.<ref name="Leonidas"/> In February 1993, the [[European Community]] sent 4.5 million [[European Currency Unit|ECU]]s to Armenia.<ref name="Leonidas"/> Armenia's southern neighbor Iran, also helped Armenia economically by providing power and electricity. Elchibey's oppositional stance against Iran and his remarks to unify with Iran's Azeri minority alienated relations between the two.

Azeris displaced as [[internally displaced person|internal]] and international [[refugee]]s were forced to live in makeshift camps provided by both the Azerbaijan government and Iran. The [[International Red Cross]] also distributed blankets to the Azeris and noted that by December, enough food was being allocated for the refugees.<ref>

Its oil refineries were not generating at full capacity and production quotas fell well short of estimates. In 1965, the oil fields in Baku were producing 21.5 million tons of oil annually; by 1988, that number had dropped down to almost 3.3 million. Outdated Soviet refinery equipment and a reluctance by Western oil companies to invest in a war region where pipelines would routinely be destroyed prevented Azerbaijan from fully exploiting its oil wealth.<ref name="Croissant"/>

==Summer 1993, the war spills out==
===Conflicts at home===
Despite the grueling winter both countries had suffered, the new year was viewed enthusiastically by both sides. President Elchibey expressed optimism towards bringing an agreeable solution to the conflict with Armenia's Ter-Petrossian. Glimmers of such hope however, quickly began to fade in [[January 1993]], despite the calls for a new cease fire by [[Boris Yeltsin]] and [[George H. W. Bush]], as hostilities in the region brewed up once more.<ref>

Frustration over these military defeats took a toll in the domestic front in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan's military had grown more desperate and defense minister Gaziev and Huseynov's brigade turned to Russian help, a move which ran against Elchibey's policies construable as insubordination. Political infighting and arguments on where to shift military units between the country's ministry of the interior, [[<U+0130>sgandar Hamidov]], and Gaziev led to the latters' resignation on [[February 20]]. A political shakedown also occurred in Armenia when Ter-Petrossian dismissed the country's prime minister, Khosrov Arutyunyan and his cabinet for failing to implement a viable economic plan for the country. Protests by Armenians against Ter-Petrossian's leadership were also suppressed and put down.<ref>{{cite news

===Kelbajar===
{{main|Battle of Kelbajar}}
Situated west of northern Karabakh, out of the boundaries of the region, was the ''[[Administrative divisions of Azerbaijan|rayon]]'' of [[Kalbajar|Kelbajar]] which bordered alongside Armenia. With a population of about 45,000, the several dozen villages were made up of Azeris and [[Kurds]]. In [[March 1993|March of 1993]], the Armenian-held areas near the [[Sarsang reservoir]] in [[Mardakert]] were reported to have been coming under attack by the Azeris. After successfully defending the Martuni region, Melkonian's fighters were tasked to move to capture the region of Kelbajar, where the incursions and purported artillery shelling were said to have been coming from.<ref name="brothersroad"/> Scant military opposition by the Azeris allowed Melkonian's fighters to quickly gain a foothold in the region and also captured several abandoned armored vehicles and tanks. At 2:45 P.M., on April 2, Armenian forces from two different directions advanced towards Kelbajar in an attack that quickly struck against Azeri armor and troops entrenched near the Ganje-Kelbjar intersection. Azeri forces were unable to halt advances made by Armenian armor units and nearly all died defending the area. The second attack towards Kelbajar also quickly overran the defenders. By April 3, Armenian forces had captured Kelbajar.<ref name="brothersroad"/>

The offensive provoked international rancor against the Armenian government, marking the first time Armenian forces had crossed the boundaries of the enclave itself and into Azerbaijan's territory. On [[April 30]], the [[United Nations Security Council|United Nations Security Council (UNSC)]] passed Resolution 822, co-sponsored by Turkey and [[Pakistan]], affirming Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and demanding that Armenian forces withdraw from Kelbajar.<ref name="UN">
[http://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm#822 United Nations Security Council Resolution 822 passed on 30 April 1993] Text provided by the US State Department. A total of four UNSC resolutions were passed in regards to the conflict.</ref>

The political repercussions were also felt in Azerbaijan when Huseynov embarked on his "march to Baku" from Ganje. Frustrated with what he felt was Elchibey's incompetence in dealing with the conflict and demoted from his rank of colonel, his brigade advanced towards Baku to unseat the President in early June. Elchibey stepped down from office on [[June 18]] and power was assumed by then parliamentary member Heidar Aliev. On [[July 1]], Huseynov was appointed prime minister of Azerbaijan.<ref>The Associated Press. [http://www.thestar.com Rebel troops push toward Azeri capital] Toronto Star. June 21, 1993, p.

===Agdam, Fizuli, Jebrail, and Zangelan fall===
{{main|1993 Summer Offensives}}
While the people of Azerbaijan were adjusting to the new political landscape, many Armenians were coping with the death of Melkonian who was killed earlier on [[June 12]] in a skirmish near the town of Merzuli as his death was publicly mourned at a national level in Yerevan. The Armenian forces exploited the political crisis in Baku, which had left the Karabakh front almost undefended by the Azerbaijani forces.<ref name="dewaal"/> The following four month of political instability in Azerbaijan led to the loss of control over five districts, as well as the north of Nagorno Karabakh.<ref name="dewaal"/> Azerbaijani military forces were unable to put up much resistance to Armenian advances and left most of the areas without any serious fighting.<ref name="dewaal"/> In late June, they were driven out from Martakert, losing their final foothold of the enclave. By July, the Armenian forces were preparing to attack and capture the region of [[Agdam]], another rayon nestled outside of Nagorno-Karabakh, claiming that they were attempting to bolster a greater security buffer to keep Azeri artillery out of range.<ref>The genuineness of the NKR's claims during the 1993 summer offensives were widely questioned in the international forum on whether or not Karabakh forces were wantonly seizing the territories surrounding the enclave. While many doubted that they were true, periodical fighting between the two sides in the regions were reported to have been occurring months before the offensives took place.</ref>

On [[July 4]], an artillery bombardment was commenced by Armenian forces against the region's capital of Agdam, destroying many parts of the town. Soldiers, along with the civilians began to evacuate Agdam. Facing a military collapse, Aliev attempted to mediate with the [[de-facto]] Karabakh government and Minsk Group officials. In mid-August, Armenians massed a force to take the Azeri regions of [[Fizuli]] and [[Jabrayil|Jebrail]], south of Nagorno-Karabakh proper.

In light of the Armenians' advance into Azerbaijan, Turkey's prime minister [[Tansu <U+00C7>iller]], warned the Armenian government not to attack Nakhichevan and demanded that Armenians pull out of Azerbaijan's territories. Thousands of Turkish troops were sent to the border between Turkey and Armenia in early September. Russian Federation forces in Armenia countered their movements and thus warded off any possibility that Turkey might play a military role in the conflict.<ref>During the [[Russian constitutional crisis of 1993]], one of the coup's leaders against Russian President Yeltsin, [[Chechen people|Chechen]] [[Ruslan Khasbulatov]], was reported by the US and French intelligence agencies to preparing Russian troop withdrawals from Armenia if the coup succeeded. An estimated 23,000 Russian soldiers were stationed in Armenia on the border of Turkey. <U+00C7>iller was reported by the agencies to be collaborating with Khasbulatov for him to give her tacit support in allowing possible military incursions by Turkey into Armenia under the pretext of pursuing [[PKK]] guerrillas, an act it had once followed up on earlier the same year in northern [[Iraq]]. Russian armed forces, however, crushed the coup.</ref>

By early September, Azeri forces were nearly in complete disarray. Much of the heavy weapons they had received and bought by the Russians were either taken out of action or abandoned during the battles. Since the June 1992 offensive, Armenian forces captured dozens of tanks, light armor and artillery from the Azeris.<ref>For example, according to Melkonian in a television interview in March 1993, his forces in Martuni alone had captured or destroyed a total of 55 [[T-72]]s, 24 [[BMP-2]]s, 15 [[Armoured personnel carrier|APC]]s and 25 pieces of heavy artillery since the June 1992 Azeri offensive, stating that "most of our arms...[were] captured from Azerbaijan." [[Serzh Sargsyan]], the then military leader of the Karabakh armed forces claimed they had captured a total of 156 tanks throughout the war: op. cit. in ''Black Garden'', p. 316. By the summer of 1993, Armenian forces had captured so much equipment that many of them were praising Elchibey's war policies since he was, in effect, arming both sides: Melkonian. ''My Brother's Road'', p. 237.</ref> Further signs of Azerbaijan's desperation included the recruitment by Aliev of 1,000<U+2013>1,500 [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghan]] and Arab [[mujahadeen]] fighters from [[Afghanistan]]. Although the Azerbaijani government denied this claim, correspondence and photographs captured by Armenian forces indicated otherwise.<ref name="Croissant"> Azerbaijan's attempts to recruit from its [[Lezgin]] and [[Talysh people|Talysh]] minorities was met with stiff resistance. Other sources of foreign help arrived from Pakistan and also Chechnya including guerilla fighter [[Shamil Basayev]].<ref>Vartanyan, Arkady.

In [[October 1993]], Aliev was formally elected as President, and promised to bring social order to the country in addition to recapturing the lost regions. In October, Azerbaijan joined the CIS. The winter season was marked with similar conditions as in the previous year, both sides scavenging for wood and harvesting foodstuffs months in advance. Two subsequent UNSC resolutions were passed, (874 and 884), in October and November and, although reemphasizing the same points as the previous two, they acknowledged Nagorno-Karabakh as a party to the conflict.<ref name="UN"/> 

In early January, Azerbaijani forces and Afghan guerrillas recaptured part of the [[Fizuli]] district, including the railway junction of Horadiz on the Iranian border, but failed to recapture the town of Fizuli itself.<ref name="UnholyWars"/> On [[January 10]], [[1994]], an offensive was launched by Azerbaijan towards the region of Mardakert in an attempt to recapture the northern section of the enclave. The offensive managed to advance and take back several parts of Karabakh in the north and to the south of but soon stalled. The Republic of Armenia began sending conscripts and regular Army and Interior Ministry troops to stop Azerbaijani advancements in Karabakh.<ref name="HRW2">[http://www.hrw.org/reports/1995/WR95/HELSINKI-01.htm Human Rights Watch World Report 1995]</ref>  To bolster the ranks of its army, the Armenian government issued a decree, instituting a three-month call-up for men up to age forty-five and resorted to press-gang raids to enlist recruits. Several active-duty Armenian Army soldiers were captured by the Azerbaijani forces.<ref name="HRW2"/>

Azerbaijan's offensives grew more dire as men as young as 16 with little to no training at all were recruited and sent to take part in ineffective [[human wave]] attacks, tactics once employed by [[Iran]] during the [[Iran-Iraq War]]. The two offensives that took place in the winter cost Azerbaijan as many as 5,000 men (at the loss of several hundred Armenians).<ref name="Croissant"/> The main Azeri offensive was aimed at recapturing the Khelbajar district, thus threatening the Lachin corridor. The attack initially met little resistance and was successful in capturing the vital Omar Pass. However, as the Armenian forces reacted, the bloodiest clashes of the war ensued and the Azeri forces were soundly defeated. Several Azeri brigades were isolated when the Armenians recaptured the Omar Pass, and were eventually surrounded and liquidated.

While the political foundations changed hands several times in Azerbaijan, most Armenian soldiers in Karabakh claimed that the youths, and Azeris themselves, were demoralized and lacked a sense of purpose and commitment to fighting the war.<ref>As one Armenian fighter commented: "The difference is in what you do and what you do it for. You know a few miles back is your family, children, women and old people, and therefore you're duty-bound to fight to the death so that those behind you will live."</ref> Russian professor Georgiy I. Mirsky also supported this viewpoint, stating that "Karabakh does not matter to Azerbaijanis as much as it does to Armenians. Probably, this is why young volunteers from Armenia proper have been much more eager to fight and die for Karabakh than the Azerbaijanis have."<ref>{{cite book

===Final cease-fire===
After six years of intensive fighting, both sides were ready for a cease-fire. Azerbaijan, after exhausting nearly all its manpower was relying on a cease-fire to be put forth by either the CSCE or by Russia as Armenian commanders stated their forces had an unimpeded path towards [[Baku]]. The borders however remained confined to Karabakh and the immediate rayons surrounding it. Diplomatic channels increased between Armenia and Azerbaijan in the month of May.<ref name="Croissant"/> The final battles of the conflict took place near Shahumyan in a series of brief engagements between Armenian and Azeri forces at Gulistan.

On May 16, the leaders of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh, and Russia met in Moscow to sign a truce that would effectively call for a cessation of hostilities. In Azerbaijan, many welcomed the end of hostilities, while others felt that a contingent of peacekeeping troops to temporarily remain in the area should not have came from Russia. Sporadic fighting continued in some parts of the region but all sides affirmed that they would stay committed to honoring the cease-fire.<ref>{{cite book

The air war in Karabakh involved primarily [[fighter jets]] and attack helicopters. The primary transport helicopters of the war were the [[Mi-8]] and its cousin, the [[Mi-17]] and were used extensively by both sides. Armenia's active air force consisted of only two [[Su-25]] ground support bombers, one of which was lost due to [[friendly fire]].

Azerbaijan's air force was composed of forty-five combat aircraft which were often piloted by experienced Russian and [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[mercenaries]] from the former Soviet military. They flew mission sorties over Karabakh with such sophisticated jets as the [[Mig-25]] and [[Sukhoi Su-24]] and with older-generation Soviet [[fighter bomber]]s, such as the [[Mig-21]]. They were reported to have being paid a monthly salary of over 5,000 [[Soviet ruble|ruble]]s and flew bombing campaigns from air force bases in Azerbaijan often targeting Stepanakert.<ref name="Topguns"/> 

These pilots, like the men from the Soviet interior forces in the onset of the conflict, were also poor and took the jobs as a means of supporting their families. Several were shot down over the city by Armenian forces, and according to one of the pilots' commanders, with assistance provided by the Russians. Many of these pilots faced the threat of execution by Armenian forces if they were shot down. The setup of the defense system severely hampered Azerbaijan's ability to carry out and launch more air strikes.<ref name="Topguns"/> The most widely used [[helicopter gunship]] by both the Armenians and Azeris was the Soviet-made [[Mil Mi-24|Mil Mi-24 Krokodil]].<ref>Under the protocols of the Tashkent Agreement signed in [[Uzbekistan]] in May 1992, the former Soviet republics were allocated a certain number of tanks, armored vehicles and combat aircraft. The agreement allowed Armenia and Azerbaijan to have a total of 100 aircraft. The Armenian Air Force currently possesses a fleet of 12 Mil Mi-24s gunships, 9 [[Mil Mi-2]]s and 13 [[Mil Mi-8]]s transport helicopters. Azerbaijan's air force has a near-similar fleet of 15 Mil Mi-24s, 7 Mil Mi-2, 15 [[Mil Mi-6]], and 13 Mil Mi-8 utility helicopters.</ref>

==The Russian role==
[[Russia]], the largest republic of the former [[Soviet Union]], played a dual and often obfuscated role during the war. The [[hardline]] members of the Soviet government supported [[Azerbaijan]] in the initial stages of the war because "until the Soviet Union's collapse...Azerbaijan was the last bastion of communist orthodoxy in the Caucasus."<ref name="timestepanakert"/> A contingent of troops during the war consisted of a 23,000-man force housed at the [[Russian 102nd Military Base]] near [[Gyumri]]. In Azerbaijan, Russian forces sped up the process of withdrawing after the assault on [[Khojaly]] and completely withdrew in 1993, one year ahead of schedule. Russian support during the war remained officially neutral. However, despite this stance, both sides accused the Russian military of favoritism.<ref name="brothersroad"/>

While Azerbaijan alleged involvement of Russian Army units based in Armenia during the Armenian offensives on Azerbaijani positions, the Armenian side claimed that Russian combatants were volunteers. On September 11, 1992, Azerbaijani forces captured six Russian special forces (spetznaz) troops of the 7th Russian Army based in Armenia near the village of Merjimek in Kelbajar. The men reportedly were paid in Russian rubles by the Armenian Ministry of Defense for action near the village of Srkhavend, Nagorno-Karabakh, in June 1992. Soldiers of Armenian descent serving in the Russian 127<sup>th</sup> Division based in Armenia were captured in Kelbajar province, Azerbaijan, in January 1994.<ref name="HRW">Human Rights Watch/Helsinki. ''Azerbaijan: Seven Years of Conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh''. New York, 1994.</ref> But, as Markar Melkonian, Monte Melkonian's brother, notes, Russia welcomed the Armenian victories, including Kelbajar's:

{{quotation|The Armenian offensive came at a time of escalating military threats to Russia: [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] was eager to push NATO right  up to Russia's western doorstep, to set up military bases in [[Central Asia]], and to abrogate the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]]. Chechnya teetered on the brink of secessionist rebellion in the high Caucasus, while...the newly independent Republic of Georgia, was tearing itself up in civil war. And now Azerbaijan, the former Soviet Republic, once again turned its eyes toward Russia's age-old enemy, Turkey....Only Armenia held any promise as a reliable Russian ally in the southern Caucasus.<ref name="brothersroad"/>}}

Although it is well known that Russians among other ethnic groups of the former Soviet Union fought as mercenaries on both sides, official Russian military support relied primarily on the accounts of eyewitnesses. Russian military units were said to have been cooperating with Armenian units when they took Khojaly and similarly with Azerbaijan during its summer 1992 offensive. But even after the 366<sup>th</sup> regiment was officially withdrawn from Karabakh, many Russian mercenaries kept fighting on the Armenian side, seeing no future in Russia if they returned. A ''[[Boston Globe]]'' correspondent witnessed in March 1992 "a fair sprinkling of non-Armenian troops in and around Stepanakert." Among them was lieutenant colonel Yury Nikolayevich, who was said to have been the deputy commander of the 366<sup>th</sup> Motorized Regiment, who went over to the Armenian fighters with a large part of the regiment's military hardware.<ref name="dewaal"/>

==Misconduct==
Emerging from the collapse of the Soviet Union as nascent states and due to the near-immediate fighting, it was not until mid-1993 that Armenia and Azerbaijan became signatories of international law agreements, including the [[Geneva Conventions]]. Allegations from all three governments (including Nagorno-Karabakh's) regularly accused the other side of committing atrocities which were at times confirmed by third party media sources or human rights organizations. Khojaly, for example, was confirmed by both Human Rights Watch and Memorial while what became known as the [[Maraghar Massacre]] was first independently affirmed by the British-based human rights organization [[Christian Solidarity Worldwide|Christian Solidarity International]] in 1992.<ref>Speech given by [[Baroness]] [[Caroline Cox]] in April 1998. [http://sumgait.info/maraga/maraga-eng/survivors-maraghar.htm Survivors of Maraghar massacre: It was truly like a contemporary Golgotha many times over]. Retrieved February 10, 2007.</ref> Azerbaijan was also criticized for its use of aerial bombing in densely populated civilian areas.<ref name="HRW"/>

The lack of international laws for either side to abide by virtually sanctioned activity in the war to what would be considered [[war crimes]]. Looting and mutilation (body parts such as ears, brought back from the front as treasured war souvenirs) of dead soldiers were commonly reported and even boasted about among soldiers.<ref name="dewaal"/> Another practice that took form, not by soldiers but by regular civilians during the war, was the bartering of prisoners between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. Often, when contact was lost between family members and a soldier or a militiaman serving at the front, they took it upon themselves to organize an exchange by personally capturing a soldier from the battle lines and holding them in the confines of their own homes. [[New York Times]] journalist Yo'av Karny noted this practice was as "old as the people occupying [the] land."<ref>{{cite book

After the war ended, both sides alleged their opponents of continuing to hold captives; Azerbaijan claimed Armenia was continuing to hold near 5,000 Azeri prisoners while Armenians claimed Azerbaijan was holding 600 people. The non-profit group, Helsinki Initiative 92, investigated two prisons in Shusha and Stepanakert after the war ended, but concluded there were no prisoners-of-war there. A similar investigation found the same result while searching for Armenians allegedly laboring in Azerbaijan's quarries.<ref>

{{fnb|(I)}} The region's names in various languages tend to have the same approximate meaning. The name first originated in [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] and [[Persian Empire|Persian]] sources in the 13th and 14th centuries. Both in Armenian and Azerbaijani, the name of the region translates to "mountainous Karabakh [black garden]". Armenians also commonly refer to it as [[Artsakh]], an allusion to the tenth province of the ancient [[Kingdom of Armenia]]; the name is often seen shortened to simply Karabakh in news sources and books. Other languages such as Russian and French refer to the region, respectively, as Nagorny Karabakh and Haut-Karabakh (Upper Karabakh).
