The '''climate of India''' comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a vast geographic scale and varied topography, making generalisations difficult. Based on the [[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification|K<U+00F6>ppen system]], [[India]] hosts six major climatic subtypes, ranging from arid desert in the west, alpine tundra and glaciers in the north, and humid tropical regions supporting rainforests in the southwest and the island territories. Many regions have starkly different [[microclimate]]s. The nation has four seasons: winter (January and February), summer (March to May), a [[monsoon]] (rainy) season (June<U+2013>September), and a post-monsoon period (October<U+2013>December).

India's [[geography of India|unique geography]] and [[geology of India|geology]] strongly influence its climate; this is particularly true of the [[Himalayas]] in the north and the [[Thar Desert]] in the northwest. The Himalayas act as a barrier to the frigid [[katabatic wind]]s flowing down from [[Central Asia]]. Thus, [[North India]] is kept warm or only mildly cooled during winter; in summer, the same phenomenon makes India relatively hot. Although the [[Tropic of Cancer]]<U+2014>the boundary between the tropics and subtropics<U+2014>passes through the middle of India, the whole country is considered to be tropical. 

As in much of the tropics, monsoonal and other weather conditions in India are unstable: major droughts, floods, cyclones and other natural disasters are sporadic, but have killed or displaced millions. India's long-term climatic stability is further threatened by [[global warming]]<!--Or would "global warming" be a better link? As is, climatic stability is threatened by climate change is a circular statement-->. Climatic diversity in India makes the analysis of these issues complex.

== History ==

During the [[Lopingian|Late Permian]] (some 260<U+2013>251&nbsp;[[mya (unit)|million years ago]] (mya)), the [[Indian subcontinent]] was part of the vast [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]]. Despite its position within a high-latitude belt at 55<U+2013>75<U+00B0>&nbsp;S (as opposed to its current position between 5 and 35<U+00B0>&nbsp;N), latitudes now occupied by such places as [[Greenland]] and  parts of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], India likely experienced a humid temperate climate with warm, frost-free weather, though with well-defined seasons.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chumakov NM, Zharkov MA |year=2003 |url=http://palaeoentomolog.ru/Lib/Chumakov3.pdf |title=Climate of the Late Permian and Early Triassic: General Inferences |journal=Stratigraphy and Geological Correlation |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=361-375 |accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref> Later, India joined the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]], a process beginning some 550<U+2013>500&nbsp;mya. During the Late [[Paleozoic]], Gondwana extended from a point at or near the [[South Pole]] to near the equator, where the [[Indian craton]] (stable [[continental crust]]) was positioned, resulting in a mild climate favourable to hosting high-[[biomass]] [[ecosystems]]; this is underscored by India's vast coal reserves<U+2014>much of it from the late Paleozoic sedimentary sequence<U+2014>the fourth-largest reserves in the world.<ref name=coalreservecia>{{cite web

India is home to an extraordinary variety of climatic regions, ranging from tropical in the south to temperate and alpine in the Himalayan north, where elevated regions receive sustained winter snowfall. The nation's climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert.<ref name="Chang_1967">{{cite journal |author=Chang, JH |year=1967 |title=The Indian Summer Monsoon |journal=Geographical Review |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=373-396}}</ref> The Himalayas, along with the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains in [[Pakistan]], prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar [[latitude]]s.<ref name="Posey_1994_118">{{harvnb|Posey|1994|p=118}}.</ref> Simultaneously, the Thar Desert plays a role in attracting moisture-laden southwest summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall.<ref name="Chang_1967"/><ref name="NCERT_28">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncert.nic.in/book_publishing/Class%209/Geography/Chapter%204.pdf |title=Climate |work=National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT). |pages=p. 28 |accessdate=2007-03-31}}</ref> Four major climatic groupings predominate, into which fall seven climatic zones that, as designated by experts, are defined on the basis of such traits as temperature and precipitation.<ref name="Heitzman_Worden_1996_97">{{harvnb|Heitzman|Worden|1996|p=97}}.</ref> Groupings are assigned codes (see chart) according to the K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification system.

=== Tropical wet ===

A tropical rainy climate covers regions experiencing persistent warm or high temperatures, which normally do not fall below {{convert|18|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0|lk=on}}. India hosts two climatic subtypes that fall under this group. The most humid is the tropical wet monsoon climate that covers a strip of southwestern lowlands abutting the [[Malabar Coast]], the [[Western Ghats]], and southern [[Assam]]. India's two island territories, [[Lakshadweep]] and the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]], are also subject to this climate. Characterised by moderate to high year-round temperatures, even in the foothills, its rainfall is seasonal but heavy<U+2014>typically above {{convert|2000|mm|in|0|lk=on}} per year.<ref name="Chouhan_1992_7">{{harvnb|Chouhan|1992|p=7}}.</ref> Most rainfall occurs between May and November; this is adequate for the maintenance of lush forests and other vegetation throughout the remainder of the year. December to March are the driest months, when days with precipitation are rare. The heavy monsoon rains are responsible for the extremely biodiverse tropical wet forests of these regions.

In India, a tropical wet and dry climate is more common. Significantly drier than tropical wet zones, it prevails over most of inland peninsular India except for a semi-arid rain shadow east of the Western Ghats. Winter and early summer are long, dry periods with temperatures averaging above {{convert|18|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0}}. Summer is exceptionally hot; temperatures in low-lying areas may exceed {{convert|50|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0}} during May, leading to heat waves that may each kill hundreds of Indians.<ref name="Farooq_2002"/> The rainy season lasts from June to September; annual rainfall averages between 750<U+2013>1500&nbsp;millimetres (30<U+2013>59&nbsp;in) across the region. Once the dry northeast monsoon begins in September, most precipitation in India falls on Tamil Nadu, leaving other states comparatively dry.<ref name="Healy">{{cite web |author=Healy M |title=South Asia: Monsoons |publisher=Harper College |url=http://www.harpercollege.edu/mhealy/g101ilec/sasia/ssd/ssmon/ssmonfr.htm |accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref>

=== Tropical dry ===

A tropical arid and semi-arid climate dominates regions where the rate of moisture loss through [[evapotranspiration]] exceeds that from precipitation; it is subdivided into three climatic subtypes. The first, a tropical semi-arid steppe climate, predominates over a long stretch of land south of Tropic of Cancer and east of the Western Ghats and the [[Cardamom Hills]]. The region, which includes [[Karnataka]], inland Tamil Nadu, western [[Andhra Pradesh]], and central [[Maharashtra]], gets between 400<U+2013>750&nbsp;millimetres (16<U+2013>30&nbsp;in) annually. It is drought-prone, as it tends to have less reliable rainfall due to sporadic lateness or failure of the southwest monsoon.<ref name="Caviedes_2001_124">{{harvnb|Caviedes|2001|p=124}}</ref> North of the [[Krishna River]], the summer monsoon is responsible for most rainfall; to the south, significant post-monsoon rainfall also occurs in October and November. In December, the coldest month, temperatures still average around 20<U+2013>24<U+00B0>C (68<U+2013>75&nbsp;<U+00B0>F). The months between March to May are hot and dry; mean monthly temperatures hover around {{convert|320|mm|in|0}}. Hence, without artificial irrigation, this region is not suitable for permanent agriculture.

[[Image:Great rann of kutch.JPG|thumb|The [[Rann of Kutch]], a vast [[salt marsh]] south of the Thar Desert in [[Gujarat]]. During the monsoon season, the region fills with standing waters.]]
<!--[[Image:Jaisalmer-3.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jaisalmer]], in western Rajasthan, is situated in the heart of the Thar Desert. The region is arid and dusty.]]-->

Most of western [[Rajasthan]] experiences an arid climatic regime. [[Cloudburst]]s are responsible for virtually all of the region's annual precipitation, which totals less than {{convert|300|mm|in|0}}. Such bursts happen when monsoon winds sweep into the region during July, August, and September. Such rainfall is highly erratic; regions experiencing rainfall one year may not see precipitation for the next couple of years or so. Atmospheric moisture is largely prevented from precipitating due to continuous [[vertical draft|downdrafts]] and other factors.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Singhvi AK, Kar A |url=http://www.ias.ac.in/jess/sep2004/eps-singh.pdf |title=The aeolian sedimentation record of the Thar Desert |journal=Proc Indian Acad Sci (Earth Planet Sci) |year=2004 |month=September |volume=113 |issue=3 |pages=371-401 |accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref> The summer months of May and June are exceptionally hot; mean monthly temperatures in the region hover around {{convert|35|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0}}, with daily maxima occasionally topping {{convert|50|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0}}. During winters, temperatures in some areas can drop below freezing due to waves of cold air from Central Asia. There is a large diurnal range of about {{convert|14|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0}} during summer; this widens by several degrees during winter.

East of the Thar Desert, the region running from [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[Haryana]] to [[Kathiawar]] experiences a tropical and sub-tropical [[steppe]] climate. The zone, a transitional climatic region separating tropical desert from humid sub-tropical savanna and forests, experiences temperatures that are less extreme than those of the desert. Average annual rainfall is 30<U+2013>65&nbsp;cm, but is very unreliable; as in much of the rest of India, the southwest monsoon accounts for most precipitation. Daily summer temperature maxima rise to around {{convert|40|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0}}. The resulting natural vegetation typically comprises short, coarse grasses.

=== Subtropical humid ===

Most of Northeast India and much of North India are subject to a humid sub-tropical climate. Though they experience hot summers, temperatures during the coldest months may fall as low as {{convert|0|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0}}. Due to ample monsoon rains, India has only one subtype of this climate, ''Cfa'' (under the K<U+00F6>ppen system).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.utexas.edu/depts/grg/kimmel/GRG301K/grg301kkoppen.html|author=Kimmel TM |title=Weather and climate: Koppen climate classification flow chart |publisher=University of Texas at Austin |year=2000 |accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref> In most of this region, there is very little precipitation during the winter, owing to powerful anticyclonic and katabatic (downward-flowing) winds from Central Asia. Due to the region's proximity to the Himalayas, it experiences elevated prevailing wind speeds, again from the influence of Central Asian katabatic movements.

Humid subtropical regions are subject to pronounced dry winters. Winter rainfall<U+2014>and occasionally snowfall<U+2014>is associated with large storm systems such as "Nor'westers" and "Western disturbances"; the latter are steered by [[westerlies]] towards the Himalayas.<ref name="Das_2002"/> Most summer rainfall occurs during powerful thunderstorms associated with the southwest summer monsoon; occasional [[tropical cyclones]] also contribute. Annual rainfall ranges from less than {{convert|1000|mm|in|0}} in the west to over {{convert|2500|mm|in|0}} in parts of the northeast. As most of this region is far from the ocean, the wide temperature swings more characteristic of a [[continental climate]] predominate; the swings are wider than in those in tropical wet regions, ranging from {{convert|24|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0}} in north-central India to {{convert|27|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0}} in the east.

=== Montane ===

[[Image:Pangong lake by martinl.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pangong Tso|Pangong Lake]] in [[Ladakh]], an arid montane region lying deep within the Himalayas.]]

India's northernmost fringes are subject to a montane, or alpine, climate. In the Himalayas, the rate at which an air mass's temperature falls per kilometre of altitude gained (the [[lapse rate|adiabatic lapse rate]]) is 5.1&nbsp;<U+00B0>C/km.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Carpenter C |year=2005 |title=The environmental control of plant species density on a Himalayan elevation gradient |journal=Journal of Biogeography |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=999<U+2013>1018}}</ref> In terms of [[environmental lapse rate]], ambient temperatures fall by 0.6&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (1.1&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) for every {{convert|100|m|ft|0|lk=on}} rise in altitude. Thus, climates ranging from nearly tropical in the foothills to tundra above the [[snow line]] can coexist within several dozen miles of each other. Sharp temperature contrasts between sunny and shady slopes, high diurnal temperature variability, temperature inversions, and altitude-dependent variability in rainfall are also common. The northern side of the western Himalayas, also known as the trans-Himalayan belt, is a region of barren, arid, frigid, and wind-blown wastelands. Most precipitation occurs as snowfall during the late winter and spring months.

Areas south of the Himalayas are largely protected from cold winter winds coming in from the Asian interior. The leeward side (northern face) of the mountains receives less rain while the southern slopes, well-exposed to the monsoon, get heavy rainfall. Areas situated at altitudes of 1,070<U+2013>2,290&nbsp;m receive the heaviest rainfall, which decreases rapidly at altitudes above {{convert|2290|m|ft|0}}. The Himalayas experience their heaviest snowfall between December and February and at altitudes above {{convert|1500|m|ft|0}}. Snowfall increases with elevation by up to several dozen millimetres per 100&nbsp;metre increase. Altitudes above {{convert|5000|m|ft|0}} never experience rain; all precipitation falls as snow.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Singh P, Kumar N |year=1997 |title=Effect of orography on precipitation in the western Himalayan region |journal=Journal of Hydrology |volume=199 |issue=1 |pages=183-206}}</ref>

== Seasons ==

<!--[[Image:India Goa Fort Chapora Chapora River.jpg|thumb|Clear skies prevail during the post-monsoon and winter seasons in most parts of India, including the coastal state of [[Goa]].]]-->

The [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD) designates four official seasons:<ref name="IMD_four_seasons"/>

[[Image:Fort Bandhavgarh National Park Madhya Pradesh India.jpg|thumb|right|A winter scene in [[Bandhavgarh National Park]], [[Madhya Pradesh]].]]

* '''Winter''', occurring between January and March. The year's coldest months are December and January, when temperatures average around 10<U+2013>15&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (50<U+2013>59&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) in the northwest; temperatures rise as one proceeds towards the equator, peaking around 20<U+2013>25&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (68<U+2013>77&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) in mainland India's southeast.
* '''Summer''' or '''pre-monsoon''' season, lasting from March to June (April to July in northwestern India). In western and southern regions, the hottest month is April; for northern regions, May is the hottest month. Temperatures average around 32<U+2013>40&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (90<U+2013>104&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) in most of the interior.
* '''Monsoon''' or '''rainy''' season, lasting from June to September. The season is dominated by the humid southwest summer monsoon, which slowly sweeps across the country beginning in late May or early June. Monsoon rains begin to recede from North India at the beginning of October.
* '''Post-monsoon''' season, lasting from October to December. South India typically receives more precipitation. Monsoon rains begin to recede from North India at the beginning of October. In northwestern India, October and November are usually cloudless. Parts of the country experience the dry northeast monsoon.

The Himalayan states, being more temperate, experience an additional two seasons: autumn and spring. Traditionally, Indians note six seasons, each about two months long. These are the spring (''{{lang-sa|vasant}}''), summer (''greeshm''), monsoon season (''varsha''), early autumn (''sharad''), late autumn (''hemant''), and winter (''shishir''). These are based on the astronomical division of the twelve months into six parts. The ancient [[Hindu calendar]] also reflects these seasons in its arrangement of months.

=== Winter ===

<!--[[Image:Gurudongmar north sikkim himalayas india.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gurudogmar Lake]] in winter, elevation {{convert|5148|m|ft|0}}, in [[North Sikkim]].]]-->

<!--[[Image:Vaishno.jpg|thumb|right|Inclement conditions abound in Indian Himalayas: pictured is the [[Vaishno Devi]] temple in [[Jammu]], shrouded in snow.]]-->

Once the monsoons subside, average temperatures gradually fall across India. As the Sun's vertical rays move south of the equator, most of the country experiences moderately cool weather; temperatures change by about {{convert|0.6|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|1}} per degree of latitude. December and January are the coldest months, with mean temperatures of 10<U+2013>15&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (50<U+2013>59&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) in Indian Himalayas. Mean temperatures are higher in the east and south, where they reach 20<U+2013>25&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (68<U+2013>77&nbsp;<U+00B0>F). 

In northwestern India, virtually cloudless conditions prevail in October and November, resulting in wide diurnal temperature swings; as in much of the Deccan Plateau, they range between 16<U+2013>20&nbsp;<U+00B0>C. However, from March to May, "western disturbances" bring heavy bursts of rain and snow.

[[Image:Wandoor beach andaman islands india.jpg|thumb|right|Even in winter, temperatures in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (pictured) and [[Lakshadweep]] remain remarkably equable; monthly averages do not vary by more than {{convert|2|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0}}.]]

The rest of India, including the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]], almost never receives snow. However, in the plains, temperatures occasionally fall below freezing, though never for more one or two days.

=== Summer ===

[[Image:Khajjiar himachal pradesh india summer.jpg|thumb|right|A summer view of [[Khajjiar]], a hill station in [[Himachal Pradesh]].]]

Summer in northwestern India lasts from April to July, and in the rest of the country from March to June. The temperatures in the north rise as the vertical rays of the Sun reach the Tropic of Cancer. The hottest month for the western and southern regions of the country is April; for most of North India, it is May. Temperatures of {{convert|50|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0}} and higher have been recorded in parts of India during this season.<ref name="Farooq_2002">{{cite news |author=Farooq O |title=India's heat wave tragedy |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1994174.stm |date=[[17 May]] [[2002]] |accessdate=2007-04-06}}</ref> In cooler regions of North India, immense pre-monsoon [[squall]]-line thunderstorms, known locally as "Nor'westers", commonly drop large hailstones.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Changnon SA |year=1971 |url=http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1175%2F1520-0450(1971)010%3C0169%3ANOHSD%3E2.0.CO%3B2 |title=Note on hailstone size distributions |journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=168<U+2013>170 |accessdate=2007-04-06}}</ref> Near the coast the temperature hovers around {{convert|36|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0}}, and the proximity of the sea increases the level of humidity. In southern India, the temperatures are higher on the east coast by a few degrees compared to the west coast. 

By May, most of the Indian interior experiences mean temperatures over {{convert|32|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0}}, while maximum temperatures often exceed {{convert|40|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0}}. In the hot months of April and May, western disturbances, with their cooling influence, may still arrive, but rapidly diminish in frequency as summer progresses.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pisharoty PR, Desai BN |title=Western disturbances and Indian weather |journal=Indian Journal of Meteorological Geophysics |year=1956 |volume=7 |pages=333<U+2013>338}}</ref> Notably, a higher frequency of such disturbances in April correlates with a delayed monsoon onset (thus extending summer) in northwest India. In eastern India, monsoon onset dates have been steadily advancing over the past several decades, resulting in shorter summers there.<ref name="Das_2002"/>

Altitude affects the temperature to a large extent, with higher parts of the [[Deccan Plateau]] and other areas being relatively cooler. [[Hill station]]s, such as [[Ootacamund]] ("Ooty") in the Western Ghats and [[Kalimpong]] in the eastern Himalayas, with average maximum temperatures of around {{convert|25|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0}}, offer some respite from the heat. At lower elevations, in parts of northern and western India, a strong, hot, and dry wind known as the [[Loo (wind)|Loo]] blows in from the west during the daytime; with very high temperatures, in some cases up to around {{convert|45|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0}}; it can cause fatal cases of [[Hyperthermia|sunstroke]]. [[Tornado]]es may also occur, concentrated in a corridor stretching from northeastern India towards Pakistan. They are rare, however; only several dozen have been reported since 1835.<ref name="Peterson_1981">{{cite journal |author=Peterson RE, Mehta KC |title=Climatology of tornadoes of India and Bangladesh |journal=Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=345-356 |year=1981 |month=December}}</ref>

The southwest summer monsoon, a four-month period when massive convective thunderstorms dominate India's weather, is Earth's most significant wet season.<ref name="Collier_Webb_2002_91">{{harvnb|Collier|Webb|2002|p=91}}.</ref> It results from the southeast [[trade wind]]s originating from a high-pressure mass centered over the southern Indian Ocean; attracted by a low-pressure region centered over South Asia, it gives rise to surface winds that ferry humid air into India from the southwest.<ref name="Caviedes_2001_118">{{harvnb|Caviedes|2001|p=118}}.</ref> These inflows ultimately result from a northward shift of the local jet stream, which itself results from rising summer temperatures over [[Tibet]] and the Indian subcontinent. The void left by the jet stream, which switches from a route just south of the Himalayas to one tracking north of Tibet, then attracts warm, humid air.<ref name="Burroughs_1999_138-139">{{harvnb|Burroughs|1999|pp=138-139}}.</ref>

The main factor behind this shift is the high summer temperature difference between Central Asia and the Indian Ocean.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Burns SJ, Fleitmann D, Matter A, Kramers J, Al-Subbary AA |title=Indian Ocean Climate and an Absolute Chronology over Dansgaard/Oeschger Events 9 to 13 |journal=Science |volume=301 |issue=5638 |pages=635-638 |year=2003 |issn=0036-8075}}</ref> This is accompanied by a seasonal excursion of the normally equatorial [[Intertropical Convergence Zone|intertropical convergence zone]] (ITCZ), a low-pressure belt of highly unstable weather, northward towards India.<ref name="Burroughs_1999_138-139">{{harvnb|Burroughs|1999|pp=138-139}}.</ref> This system intensified to its present strength as a result of the [[Tibetan Plateau]]'s [[orogeny|uplift]], which accompanied the [[Eocene]]<U+2013>[[Oligocene]] transition event, a major episode of global cooling and aridification which occurred 34<U+2013>49&nbsp;mya.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dupont-Nivet G, Krijgsman W, Langereis CG, Abels HA, Dai S, Fang X |title=Tibetan plateau aridification linked to global cooling at the Eocene<U+2013>Oligocene transition |journal=Nature |volume=445 |issue=7128 |pages=635-638 |year=2007 |issn=0028-0836}}</ref>

The southwest monsoon arrives in two branches: the [[Bay of Bengal]] branch and the [[Arabian Sea]] branch. The latter extends toward a low-pressure area over the Thar Desert and is roughly three times stronger than the Bay of Bengal branch. The monsoon usually breaks over Indian territory by around [[25 May]], when it lashes the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] in the Bay of Bengal. It strikes the Indian mainland around [[1 June]],<ref name="IMD_swsm_onset">{{cite web |url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/climate/monsoon-onset.htm |title=Southwest Monsoon: Normal Dates of Onset}}</ref> supplies over 80% of India's annual rainfall.<ref name="Bagla">{{cite journal |author=Bagla P |year=2006 |month=August |title=Controversial rivers project aims to turn India's fierce monsoon into a friend |journal=Science |volume=313 |issue=5790 |pages=1036-1037 |issn=0036-8075}}</ref> first appearing near the [[Malabar Coast]] of Kerala. By [[9 June]], it reaches [[Mumbai]]; it appears over [[Delhi]] by [[29 June]]. The Bay of Bengal branch, which hugs the Coromandal Coast between [[Cape Comorin]] and [[Orissa]], swerves to the northwest. The Arabian Sea branch moves northeast towards the Himalayas. By the first week of July, the entire country experiences monsoon rain; on average, South India receives more rainfall than North India. However, [[North-East India|Northeast India]] receives the most precipitation. Monsoon clouds begin retreating from North India by the end of August; it withdraws from Mumbai by [[5 October]]. As India further cools during September, the southwest monsoon weakens. By the end of November, it has left the country.<ref name="Burroughs_1999_138-139"/>

=== Post-monsoon ===

During the post-monsoon months of October to December, a different monsoon cycle, the northeast (or "retreating") monsoon, brings dry, cool, and dense Central Asian air masses to large parts of India. Winds spill across the Himalayas and flow to the southwest across the country, resulting in clear, sunny skies.<ref name="Caviedes_2001_119">{{harvnb|Caviedes|2001|p=119}}.</ref> Though the [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD) and other sources refers to this period as a fourth ("post-monsoon") season,<ref name="IMD_four_seasons">{{cite web |url=http://www.imd.ernet.in/section/nhac/dynamic/TABLE-1.htm |title=Rainfall during pre-monsoon season |work=India Meteorological Department |accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref><ref name="LOC_four_seasons">{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/intoc.html |title=A Country Study: India |work=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]] |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] ([[Federal Research Division]]) |accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Parthasarathy B, Munot AA, Kothawale DR |title=All-India monthly and seasonal rainfall series: 1871<U+2013>1993 |journal=Theoretical and Applied Climatology |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=217-224 |year=1994 |month=December |issn=0177-798X}}</ref> other sources designate only three seasons.<ref>{{cite journal |author=O'Hare G |title=The Indian Monsoon, Part Two: The Rains |journal=Geography |volume=82 |issue=4 |pages=335 |year=1997}}</ref> Depending on location, this period lasts from October to November, after the southwest monsoon has peaked.

Average daily maximum temperatures range between 28&nbsp;<U+00B0>C and 34&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (82<U+2013>93&nbsp;<U+00B0>F).

The northeast monsoon, which begins in September, lasts through the post-monsoon seasons, and only ends in March, carries winds that have already lost their moisture while crossing central Asia and the vast [[rain shadow]] region lying north of the Himalayas. They cross India diagonally from northeast to southwest. However, the large indentation made by the Bay of Bengal into India's eastern coast means that the flows are humidified before reaching [[Cape Comorin]] and rest of Tamil Nadu, meaning that the state, and also some parts of Kerala, experience significant precipitation in the post-monsoon and winter periods.<ref name="Healy"/> However, parts of West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and North-East India also receive minor precipitation from the northeast monsoon.<ref name=nemonmao>{{cite web

|}

Climate-related natural disasters cause massive losses of Indian life and property. Droughts, flash floods, cyclones, avalanches, landslides brought on by torrential rains, and snowstorms pose the greatest threats. Other dangers include frequent summer dust storms, which usually track from north to south; they cause extensive property damage in North India<ref name="Balfour_1976_995">{{harvnb|Balfour|1976|p=995}}.</ref> and deposit large amounts of dust from arid regions. Hail is also common in parts of India, causing severe damage to standing crops such as rice and wheat.

=== Floods and landslides ===

In the Lower Himalaya, landslides are common. The young age of the region's hills result in [[lability|labile]] rock formations, which are susceptible to slippages. Rising population and development pressures, particularly from logging and tourism, cause deforestation. The result, denuded hillsides, exacerbates the severity of landslides, since tree cover impedes the downhill flow of water.<ref name="Allaby_1998_26">{{harvnb|Allaby|1998|p=26}}.</ref> Parts of the Western Ghats also suffer from low-intensity landslides. Avalanches occur in Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and Sikkim.

Floods are the most common natural disaster in India. The heavy southwest monsoon rains cause the [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] and other rivers to distend their banks, often flooding surrounding areas. Though they provide rice paddy farmers with a largely dependable source of natural irrigation and fertilisation, the floods can kill thousands and displace millions. Excess, erratic, or untimely monsoon rainfall may also wash away or otherwise ruin crops.<ref name="Allaby_1998_42">{{harvnb|Allaby|1998|p=42}}.</ref><ref name="Allaby_1998_15">{{harvnb|Allaby|1998|p=15}}.</ref> Almost all of India is flood-prone, and extreme precipitation events, such as flash floods and torrential rains, have become increasingly common in central India over the past several decades, coinciding with rising temperatures. Mean annual precipitation totals have remained steady due to the declining frequency of weather systems that generate moderate amounts of rain.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Goswami BN, Venugopal V, Sengupta D, Madhusoodanan MS, Xavier PK |title=Increasing trend of extreme rain events over India in a warming environment |journal=Science |volume=314 |issue=5804 |pages=1442-1445 |year=2006 |issn=0036-8075}}</ref>

=== Cyclones ===

[[Image:Cyclone 05B 1999 India Bay of Bengal satellite image NOAA cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Satellite imagery of Cyclone 05B in the [[Bay of Bengal]].]]

[[Tropical cyclone]]s, which are severe storms spun off from the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]], may affect thousands of Indians living in coastal regions. [[Tropical cyclogenesis]] is particularly common in the northern reaches of the [[Indian Ocean]] in and around the Bay of Bengal. Cyclones bring with them heavy rains, [[storm surge]]s, and winds that often cut affected areas off from relief and supplies. In the North Indian Ocean Basin, the cyclone season runs from April to December, with peak activity between May and November.<ref name="AOML_FAQ_G1">{{cite web |author=[[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]], Hurricane Research Division |title=Frequently Asked Questions: When is hurricane season? |publisher=[[NOAA]] | accessdate=2006-07-25 |url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/G1.html}}</ref> Each year, an average of eight storms with sustained wind speeds greater than {{convert|63|km:h|mi:h|0|lk=on}} form; of these, two strengthen into true tropical cyclones, which have sustained gusts greater than {{convert|117|km:h|mi:h|0}}. On average, a major ([[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3]] or higher) cyclone develops every other year.<ref name = "AOML FAQ G1"/><ref name = "AOML FAQ E10">{{cite web |author=[[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]], Hurricane Research Division |title=Frequently Asked Questions: What are the average, most, and least tropical cyclones occurring in each basin? |publisher=[[NOAA]] |accessdate=2006-07-25 |url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/E10.html}}</ref>

During summer, the [[Bay of Bengal]] is subject to intense heating, giving rise to humid and unstable air masses that produce cyclones. Many powerful cyclones, including the [[1737 Calcutta Cyclone|1737 Calcutta cyclone]], the [[1970 Bhola cyclone]], and the [[1991 Bangladesh cyclone]], have led to widespread devastation along parts of the eastern coast of India and neighboring [[Bangladesh]]. Widespread death and property destruction are reported every year in exposed coastal states such as Andhra Pradesh, [[Orissa]], Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal.

=== Droughts ===

{{main|Drought in India}}

[[Image:Niranjana dry river bed bihar india.jpg|thumb|right|The dry bed of the Niranjana River, [[Bihar]].]]

Indian agriculture is heavily dependent on the monsoon as a source of water. In some parts of India, the failure of the monsoons result in water shortages, resulting in below-average crop yields. This is particularly true of major drought-prone regions such as southern and eastern Maharashtra, northern Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. In the past, droughts have periodically led to [[famine in India|major Indian famine]]s, including the [[Bengal famine of 1770]], in which up to one third of the population in affected areas died; the 1876<U+2013>1877 famine, in which over five million people died; the 1899 famine, in which over 4.5 million died; and the [[Bengal famine of 1943]], in which over five million died from starvation and famine-related illnesses.<ref name="Nash_2002_22-23">{{harvnb|Nash|2002|pp=22-23}}.</ref><ref name="Collier_2002_67">{{harvnb|Collier|Webb|2002|p=67}}.</ref>
