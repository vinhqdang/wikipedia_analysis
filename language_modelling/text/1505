'''Influenza''', commonly known as "the '''flu'''", is an [[infectious disease]] of [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s caused by [[RNA virus]]es of the family [[Orthomyxoviridae]], the [[Orthomyxoviridae#Types of influenza virus|influenza viruses]].  The most common [[symptom]]s are [[chills]], [[fever]], [[rhinorrhea|runny nose]], [[sore throat]], [[myalgia|muscle pains]], [[headache]] (often severe), [[cough]]ing, weakness/[[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and [[malaise|general discomfort]]. Although it is often confused with other [[influenza-like illness]]es, especially the [[common cold]], influenza is a more severe disease.<ref name=Eccles>{{cite journal |last=Eccles |first=R |title=Understanding the symptoms of the common cold and influenza |journal=Lancet Infect Dis |volume=5 |issue=11 |pages=718<U+2013>25 |year=2005 |pmid=16253889 |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(05)70270-X}}</ref> Influenza may produce [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], particularly in children,<ref name=Merck>{{cite web|url=http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec17/ch198/ch198d.html|title=Influenza: Viral Infections: Merck Manual Home Edition|publisher=Merck|accessdate=15 March 2008}}</ref> but these symptoms are more common in the unrelated [[gastroenteritis]], which is sometimes inaccurately referred to as "stomach flu" or "24-hour flu".<ref>[http://coldflu.about.com/od/flumisconceptions/f/stomachflu.htm Seasonal Flu vs. Stomach Flu] by Kristina Duda, R.N.; Retrieved 12 March 2007 (Website: "About, Inc., A part of The New York Times Company")</ref>

<!--Cause  -->
Typically, influenza is [[Airborne disease|transmitted through the air]] by coughs or sneezes, creating [[aerosols]] containing the virus. Influenza can also be transmitted by direct contact with bird droppings or [[mucus|nasal secretions]], or through contact with contaminated surfaces. Airborne aerosols have been thought to cause most infections, although which means of transmission is most important is not absolutely clear.<ref name=Brankston/> Influenza viruses can be inactivated by [[sunlight]], [[disinfectant]]s and [[detergent]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Suarez |first=D |author2=Spackman E |author3=Senne D |author4=Bulaga L |author5=Welsch A |author6=Froberg K  |title=The effect of various disinfectants on detection of avian influenza virus by real time RT-PCR |journal=Avian Dis |volume=47 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=1091<U+2013>5 |year=2003 |pmid=14575118 |doi=10.1637/0005-2086-47.s3.1091}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/biofacts/avflu_human.html Avian Influenza (Bird Flu)]: Implications for [[Disease|Human Disease]].

<!--Prevention and treatment  -->
[[Influenza vaccine|Vaccinations against influenza]] are usually made available to people in [[developed country|developed countries]].<ref name=WHOvaccines>[http://www.who.int/wer/2005/wer8033.pdf WHO position paper: influenza vaccines] ''WHO weekly Epidemiological Record'' 19 August 2005, vol. 80, 33, pp. 277<U+2013>288.</ref> Farmed poultry is often vaccinated to avoid devastation of the flocks.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Villegas |first=P |title=Viral diseases of the respiratory system |journal=Poult Sci|volume=77 |issue=8 |pages=1143<U+2013>5 |year=1998 |pmid=9706079 |doi=10.1093/ps/77.8.1143}}</ref> The most common human vaccine is the trivalent [[influenza vaccine]] (TIV) that contains purified and inactivated antigens from three viral strains. Typically, this vaccine includes material from two [[influenzavirus A|influenza A virus]] subtypes and one [[Influenzavirus B|influenza B virus]] strain.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Horwood F, Macfarlane J |title=Pneumococcal and influenza vaccination: current situation and future prospects |journal=Thorax |volume=57 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=II24<U+2013>II30 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12364707 |pmc=1766003 }}</ref> The TIV carries no risk of transmitting the disease. A vaccine formulated for one year may be ineffective in the following year, since the influenza virus evolves rapidly, and new strains quickly replace the older ones.

<!--Epidemiology and history  -->
Influenza spreads around the world in [[flu season|seasonal epidemics]], resulting in about three to five million yearly cases of severe illness and about 250,000 to 500,000 yearly deaths,<ref>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs211/en/ Influenza (Seasonal)], [[World Health Organization]], April 2009. Retrieved 13 February 2010.</ref> rising to millions in some [[pandemic]] years. In the 20th century three [[influenza pandemic]]s occurred, each caused by the appearance of a new [[strain (biology)|strain]] of the virus in humans, and killed tens of millions of people. Often, new influenza strains appear when an existing flu virus spreads to humans from another animal [[species]], or when an existing human strain picks up new [[gene]]s from a virus that usually infects birds or pigs. An avian strain named [[H5N1]] raised the concern of a new influenza pandemic after it emerged in Asia in the 1990s, but it has not [[evolution|evolved]] to a form that spreads easily between people.<ref>{{cite web |title=Avian influenza ("bird flu") fact sheet |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/avian_influenza/en/ |date=February 2006 |publisher=WHO |accessdate=20 October 2006}}</ref> In April 2009 a novel flu strain evolved that combined genes from human, pig, and bird flu.  Initially dubbed "swine flu" and also known as [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|influenza A/H1N1]], it emerged in Mexico, the United States, and several other nations. The [[World Health Organization]] officially declared the outbreak to be a pandemic on 11 June 2009 (see [[2009 flu pandemic]]). The WHO's declaration of a pandemic level 6 was an indication of spread, not severity, the strain actually having a lower mortality rate than common flu outbreaks.<ref>World Health Organization. World now at the start of 2009 influenza pandemic. http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2009/h1n1_pandemic_phase6_20090611/en/index.html</ref>

It can be difficult to distinguish between the [[common cold]] and influenza in the early stages of these infections,<ref name=Eccles/> but a flu can be identified by a high fever with a sudden onset and extreme fatigue. Influenza is a mixture of symptoms of common cold and [[pneumonia]], body ache, headache, and fatigue.

Since [[antiviral drug]]s are effective in treating influenza if given early ([[#Treatment|see treatment section]], below), it can be important to identify cases early.

The central core contains the viral [[RNA]] [[genome]] and other viral proteins that package and protect this RNA. RNA tends to be single stranded but in special cases it is double.<ref name=Lamb/> Unusually for a virus, its genome is not a single piece of [[nucleic acid]]; instead, it contains seven or eight pieces of segmented [[negative-sense]] RNA, each piece of RNA containing either one or two [[gene]]s, which code for a gene product (protein).<ref name=Bouvier/> For example, the influenza A genome contains 11 genes on eight pieces of RNA, encoding for 11 [[protein]]s: [[hemagglutinin (influenza)|hemagglutinin]] (HA), [[viral neuraminidase|neuraminidase]] (NA), [[Influenza virus nucleoprotein|nucleoprotein]] (NP), [[M1 protein|M1]], [[M2 protein|M2]], [[NS1 Influenza Protein|NS1]], NS2(NEP: nuclear export protein), PA, PB1 (polymerase basic 1), PB1-F2 and PB2.<ref name=Ghedin>{{cite journal |last=Ghedin |first=E | last2 = Sengamalay | first2 = NA | last3 = Shumway | first3 = M | last4 = Zaborsky | first4 = J | last5 = Feldblyum | first5 = T | last6 = Subbu | first6 = V | last7 = Spiro | first7 = DJ | last8 = Sitz | first8 = J | last9 = Koo | first9 = H |title=Large-scale sequencing of human influenza reveals the dynamic nature of viral genome evolution |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=437 |issue=7062 |pages=1162<U+2013>6 |date=October 2005 |pmid=16208317|doi=10.1038/nature04239 | bibcode=2005Natur.437.1162G}}</ref>

Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are the two large glycoproteins on the outside of the viral particles.

Influenza viruses bind through [[hemagglutinin]] onto [[sialic acid]] sugars on the surfaces of [[epithelium|epithelial cells]], typically in the nose, throat, and [[lung]]s of mammals, and [[intestine]]s of birds (Stage 1 in infection figure).<ref name=Wagner>{{cite journal|last=Wagner |first=R |author2=Matrosovich M |author3=Klenk H  |title=Functional balance between haemagglutinin and neuraminidase in influenza virus infections |journal=Rev Med Virol |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=159<U+2013>66 |date=May<U+2013>June 2002|pmid=11987141 |doi=10.1002/rmv.352}}</ref> After the hemagglutinin is [[proteolysis|cleaved]] by a [[protease]], the cell imports the virus by [[endocytosis]].<ref name=Steinhauer>{{cite journal |author=Steinhauer DA |title=Role of hemagglutinin cleavage for the pathogenicity of influenza virus|journal=Virology |volume=258 |issue=1 |pages=1<U+2013>20 |date=May 1999 |pmid=10329563 |doi=10.1006/viro.1999.9716}}</ref>

The intracellular details are still being elucidated. It is known that virions converge to the [[microtubule]] organizing center, interact with acidic endosomes and finally enter the target endosomes for genome release.<ref name=Liu2011>Liu SL, Zhang ZL, Tian ZQ, Zhao HS, Liu H, Sun EZ, Xiao GF, Zhang W, Wang HZ, Pang DW (2011) Effectively and efficiently dissecting the infection of influenza virus by quantum dot-based single-particle tracking. ACS Nano</ref>

Once inside the cell, the acidic conditions in the [[endosome]] cause two events to happen: First, part of the hemagglutinin protein fuses the [[viral envelope]] with the vacuole's membrane, then the M2 [[ion channel]] allows [[proton]]s to move through the viral envelope and acidify the core of the virus, which causes the core to dissemble and release the viral RNA and core proteins.<ref name=Bouvier/> The viral RNA (vRNA) molecules, accessory proteins and [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]] are then released into the [[cytoplasm]] (Stage 2).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lakadamyali |first=M |author2=Rust M |author3=Babcock H |author4=Zhuang X  |title=Visualizing infection of individual influenza viruses|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=100 |issue=16 |pages=9280<U+2013>5 |date=5 August 2003 |pmid=12883000 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0832269100|pmc=170909|bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.9280L }}</ref> The M2 ion channel is blocked by [[amantadine]] drugs, preventing infection.<ref name=Pinto>{{cite journal |author=Pinto LH, Lamb RA |title=The M2 proton channels of influenza A and B viruses |journal=J.

These core proteins and vRNA form a complex that is transported into the [[cell nucleus]], where the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase begins transcribing complementary positive-sense vRNA (Steps 3a and b).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cros |first=J |author2=Palese P|title=Trafficking of viral genomic RNA into and out of the nucleus: influenza, Thogoto and Borna disease viruses |journal=Virus Res|volume=95 |issue=1<U+2013>2 |pages=3<U+2013>12 |date=September 2003 |pmid=12921991 |doi=10.1016/S0168-1702(03)00159-X}}</ref> The vRNA either is exported into the cytoplasm and translated (step 4) or remains in the nucleus. Newly synthesized viral proteins are either secreted through the [[Golgi apparatus]] onto the cell surface (in the case of neuraminidase and hemagglutinin, step 5b) or transported back into the nucleus to bind vRNA and form new viral genome particles (step 5a). Other viral proteins have multiple actions in the host cell, including degrading cellular [[mRNA]] and using the released [[nucleotide]]s for vRNA synthesis and also inhibiting [[translation (biology)|translation]] of host-cell mRNAs.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kash |first=J |author2=Goodman A |author3=Korth M |author4=Katze M  |title=Hijacking of the host-cell response and translational control during influenza virus infection |journal=Virus Res |volume=119 |issue=1 |pages=111<U+2013>20 |date=July 2006|pmid=16630668 |doi=10.1016/j.virusres.2005.10.013}}</ref>

Negative-sense vRNAs that form the [[genome]]s of future viruses, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and other viral proteins are assembled into a virion. Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase molecules cluster into a bulge in the cell membrane. The vRNA and [[Capsid|viral core]] proteins leave the nucleus and enter this membrane protrusion (step 6). The mature virus buds off from the cell in a sphere of host [[Lipid bilayer|phospholipid membrane]], acquiring hemagglutinin and neuraminidase with this membrane coat (step 7).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Nayak|first=D |author2=Hui E |author3=Barman S  |title=Assembly and budding of influenza virus |journal=Virus Res |volume=106 |issue=2 |pages=147<U+2013>65|date=December 2004 |pmid=15567494 |doi=10.1016/j.virusres.2004.08.012}}</ref> As before, the viruses adhere to the cell through hemagglutinin; the mature viruses detach once their [[neuraminidase]] has cleaved sialic acid residues from the host cell.<ref name=Wagner/> After the release of new influenza viruses, the host cell dies.

Because of the absence of RNA [[proofreading (biology)|proofreading]] enzymes, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that copies the viral genome makes an error roughly every 10 thousand nucleotides, which is the approximate length of the influenza vRNA. Hence, the majority of newly manufactured influenza viruses are mutants; this causes [[antigenic drift]], which is a slow change in the antigens on the viral surface over time.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Drake |first=J |title=Rates of spontaneous mutation among RNA viruses |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|volume=90 |issue=9 |pages=4171<U+2013>5 |date=1 May 1993|pmid=8387212 |doi=10.1073/pnas.90.9.4171 |pmc=46468|bibcode = 1993PNAS...90.4171D }}</ref> The separation of the genome into eight separate segments of vRNA allows mixing or [[reassortment]] of vRNAs if more than one type of influenza virus infects a single cell. The resulting rapid change in viral genetics produces [[antigenic shift]]s, which are sudden changes from one antigen to another. These sudden large changes allow the virus to infect new host species and quickly overcome protective immunity.<ref name=Hilleman/> This is important in the emergence of pandemics, as discussed below in the section on [[#Epidemiology|Epidemiology]].

For instance, part of the process that allows influenza viruses to invade cells is the [[proteolysis|cleavage]] of the viral [[hemagglutinin]] protein by any one of several human [[protease]]s.<ref name=Steinhauer/> In mild and avirulent viruses, the structure of the hemagglutinin means that it can only be cleaved by proteases found in the throat and lungs, so these viruses cannot infect other tissues. However, in highly virulent strains, such as H5N1, the hemagglutinin can be cleaved by a wide variety of proteases, allowing the virus to spread throughout the body.<ref name=Korteweg/>

Due to the high [[mutation rate]] of the virus, a particular influenza vaccine usually confers protection for no more than a few years. Every year, the World Health Organization predicts which strains of the virus are most likely to be circulating in the next year (see [[Historical annual reformulations of the influenza vaccine]]), allowing [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] to develop vaccines that will provide the best immunity against these strains.<ref name=WHOrecommendation/> The vaccine is reformulated each season for a few specific flu strains but does not include all the strains active in the world during that season. It takes about six months for the manufacturers to formulate and produce the millions of doses required to deal with the seasonal epidemics; occasionally, a new or overlooked strain becomes prominent during that time.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Holmes |first=E |coauthors=Ghedin E, Miller N, Taylor J, Bao Y, St George K, Grenfell B, Salzberg S, Fraser C, Lipman D, Taubenberger J |title=Whole-genome analysis of human influenza A virus reveals multiple persistent lineages and reassortment among recent H3N2 viruses |journal=PLoS Biol |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=e300 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16026181 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030300 |pmc=1180517}}</ref> It is also possible to get infected just before vaccination and get sick with the strain that the vaccine is supposed to prevent, as the vaccine takes about two weeks to become effective.<ref name=CDCkeyfacts/>

Vaccines can cause the [[immune system]] to react as if the body were actually being infected, and general infection symptoms (many cold and flu symptoms are just general infection symptoms) can appear, though these symptoms are usually not as severe or long-lasting as influenza. The most dangerous [[adverse effect]] is a severe [[allergy|allergic reaction]] to either the virus material itself or residues from the hen eggs used to grow the influenza; however, these reactions are extremely rare.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/flushot.htm Questions & Answers: Flu Shot] CDC publication updated 24 July 2006.

Influenza's effects are much more severe and last longer than those of the [[common cold]]. Most people will recover completely in about one to two weeks, but others will develop life-threatening complications (such as [[pneumonia]]). Thus, influenza can be deadly, especially for the weak, young and old, or chronically ill.<ref name=Hilleman/> People with a [[immunosuppression|weak immune system]], such as people with advanced [[HIV]] infection or transplant patients (whose immune systems are medically suppressed to prevent transplant organ rejection), suffer from particularly severe disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hayden FG |title=Prevention and treatment of influenza in immunocompromised patients |journal=Am.

[[Image:Influenza Seasonal Risk Areas.svg|thumb|300px|Seasonal risk areas for influenza: November<U+2013>April (blue), April<U+2013>November (red), and year-round (yellow).]]
Influenza reaches peak prevalence in winter, and because the [[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]] and [[Southern Hemisphere]]s have winter at different times of the year, there are actually two different flu seasons each year. This is why the World Health Organization (assisted by the [[National Influenza Centers]]) makes recommendations for two different vaccine formulations every year; one for the Northern, and one for the Southern Hemisphere.<ref name=WHOrecommendation>[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/2007northreport.pdf Recommended composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2006<U+2013>2007 influenza season] WHO report 14 February 2006. Retrieved 19 October 2006.</ref>

A long-standing puzzle has been why outbreaks of the flu occur seasonally rather than uniformly throughout the year. One possible explanation is that, because people are indoors more often during the winter, they are in close contact more often, and this promotes transmission from person to person. Increased travel due to the Northern Hemisphere winter holiday season may also play a role.<ref name="NPR2003-12-17">[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1551913 Weather and the Flu Season] NPR Day to Day, 17 December 2003. Retrieved, 19 October 2006</ref> Another factor is that cold temperatures lead to drier air, which may dehydrate mucus, preventing the body from effectively expelling virus particles. The virus also survives longer on surfaces at colder temperatures and aerosol transmission of the virus is highest in cold environments (less than 5&nbsp;<U+00B0>C) with low relative humidity.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Influenza virus transmission is dependent on relative humidity and temperature | last1 = Lowen | first1 = AC | last2 = Mubareka | first2 = S | last3 = Steel | first3 = J | last4 = Palese | first4 = P | authorlink4 = Peter Palese | journal = PLoS Pathogens | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | page = e151 | url = http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.0030151 | format = PDF | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.0030151 | pmc = 2034399 | pmid = 17953482 |date=October 2007 }}</ref> Indeed, the lower air humidity in winter seems to be the main cause of seasonal influenza transmission in temperate regions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shaman J, Kohn M |title=Absolute humidity modulates influenza survival, transmission, and seasonality |journal=Proc.

[[File:Influenza geneticshift.svg|thumb|left|Antigenic shift, or reassortment, can result in novel and highly pathogenic strains of human influenza]]
New influenza viruses are constantly [[evolution|evolving]] by [[mutation]] or by [[reassortment]].<ref name=hay/> Mutations can cause small changes in the [[hemagglutinin]] and [[neuraminidase]] [[antigen]]s on the surface of the virus. This is called [[antigenic drift]], which slowly creates an increasing variety of strains until one evolves that can infect people who are immune to the pre-existing strains.

Most influenza virus strains are not very infectious and each infected individual will only go on to infect one or two other individuals (the basic reproduction number for influenza is generally around 1.4). However, the generation time for influenza is extremely short: the time from a person becoming infected to when he infects the next person is only two days. The short generation time means that influenza epidemics generally peak at around 2 months and burn out after 3 months: the decision to intervene in an influenza epidemic therefore has to be taken early, and the decision is therefore often made on the back of incomplete data. Another problem is that individuals become infectious before they become symptomatic, which means that putting people in quarantine after they become ill is not an effective public health intervention.<ref name="Ferguson2005"/>  For the average person, viral shedding tends to peak on day two whereas symptoms peak on day three.<ref name=AmericanJournalEpidemiology2008/>

== History ==

=== Etymology ===
The word ''Influenza'' comes from the [[Italian language]] meaning "influence" and refers to the cause of the disease; initially, this ascribed illness to unfavorable [[astrology|astrological]] influences.<ref>''Influenza'', [[Oxford English Dictionary|The Oxford English Dictionary]], second edition.</ref> Changes in medical thought led to its modification to ''influenza del freddo'', meaning "influence of the cold". The word ''influenza'' was first used in English to refer to the disease we know today in 1703 by J. Hugger of the University of Edinburgh in his thesis ''De Catarrho epidemio, vel Influenza, prout in India occidentali sese ostendit''.<ref>Creighton, Charles (1965): A History Of Epidemics In Britain, With Additional Material By D.E.C. Eversley</ref>
Archaic terms for influenza include ''epidemic catarrh'', ''grippe'' (from the French, first used by Molyneaux in 1694 <ref>{{cite journal | pmid=11576290 | last1=Potter | first1=CW | year=2001 | title=A history of influenza | journal=Journal of applied microbiology | volume=91 | issue=4 |pages= 572<U+2013>579 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2672.2001.01492.x}}</ref>), ''sweating sickness'', and ''Spanish fever'' (particularly for the [[1918 flu pandemic]] strain).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=P|title=Swine Flu|journal=Croatian Medical Journal|doi= 10.3325/cmj.2009.50.412|year=2009|volume=50|pmid=19673043|issue=4|pmc=2728380|pages=412<U+2013>5}}</ref>

The first convincing record of an influenza pandemic was of an outbreak in 1580, which began in Russia and spread to Europe via Africa. In [[History of Rome#Renaissance Rome|Rome]], over 8,000 people were killed, and several Spanish cities were almost wiped out. Pandemics continued sporadically throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, with the pandemic of 1830<U+2013>1833 being particularly widespread; it infected approximately a quarter of the people exposed.<ref name=Potter>{{cite journal |author=Potter CW

The most famous and lethal outbreak was the [[1918 flu pandemic]] (Spanish flu pandemic) ([[Influenzavirus A|type A influenza]], [[H1N1]] subtype), which lasted from 1918 to 1919.

One observer wrote, "One of the most striking of the complications was hemorrhage from [[mucous membrane]]s, especially from the nose, stomach, and intestine. Bleeding from the ears and [[petechia|petechial hemorrhages]] in the skin also occurred."<ref name=Knobler/> The majority of deaths were from [[bacterial pneumonia]], a [[secondary infection]] caused by influenza, but the virus also killed people directly, causing massive [[bleeding|hemorrhages]] and [[edema]] in the lung.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite journal | author = Taubenberger JK, Reid AH, Janczewski TA, Fanning TG | title = Integrating historical, clinical and molecular genetic data in order to explain the origin and virulence of the 1918 Spanish influenza virus | journal = [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] | volume = 356 | issue = 1416 | pages = 1829<U+2013>39 |date=December 2001 | pmid = 11779381 | pmc = 1088558 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2001.1020 }}</ref>

The 1918 flu pandemic (Spanish flu pandemic) was truly global, spreading even to the [[Arctic]] and remote [[Pacific Islands|Pacific islands]]. The unusually severe disease killed between 2 and 20% of those infected, as opposed to the more usual flu epidemic [[mortality rate]] of 0.1%.<ref name=Taubenberger/><ref name=Knobler/> Another unusual feature of this pandemic was that it mostly killed young adults, with 99% of pandemic influenza deaths occurring in people under 65, and more than half in young adults 20 to 40 years old.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Simonsen |first=L |author2=Clarke M |author3=Schonberger L |author4=Arden N |author5=Cox N |author6=Fukuda K  |title=Pandemic versus epidemic influenza mortality: a pattern of changing age distribution |journal=J Infect Dis |volume=178 |issue=1 |pages=53<U+2013>60 |date=July 1998 |pmid=9652423 |doi=10.1086/515616}}</ref> This is unusual since influenza is normally most deadly to the very young (under age 2) and the very old (over age 70). The total mortality of the 1918<U+2013>1919 pandemic is not known, but it is estimated that 2.5% to 5% of the world's population was killed. As many as 25 million may have been killed in the first 25 weeks; in contrast, [[AIDS|HIV/AIDS]] has killed 25 million in its first 25 years.<ref name=Knobler/>

Later flu pandemics were not so devastating. They included the 1957 [[Asian Flu]] (type A, [[H2N2]] strain) and the 1968 [[Hong Kong Flu]] (type A, [[H3N2]] strain), but even these smaller outbreaks killed millions of people. In later pandemics [[antibiotic]]s were available to control secondary infections and this may have helped reduce mortality compared to the Spanish Flu of 1918.<ref name=Taubenberger/>

Influenza produces [[variable cost|direct costs]] due to lost [[productivity]] and associated medical treatment, as well as [[indirect costs]] of preventative measures.

Research on influenza includes studies on [[molecular virology]], how the virus produces disease ([[pathogenesis]]), host [[immune response]]s, [[genomics|viral genomics]], and how the virus spreads ([[epidemiology]]). These studies help in developing influenza countermeasures; for example, a better understanding of the body's immune system response helps [[vaccine]] development, and a detailed picture of how influenza invades cells aids the development of antiviral drugs. One important [[Research|basic research]] program is the [[Influenza Genome Sequencing Project]], which is creating a library of influenza sequences; this library should help clarify which factors make one strain more lethal than another, which genes most affect [[immunogenicity]], and how the virus [[evolution|evolves]] over time.<ref>[http://msc.tigr.org/infl_a_virus/index.shtml Influenza A Virus Genome Project] at The Institute of Genomic Research.

A number of [[biologic medical product|biologics]], therapeutic vaccines and immunobiologics are also being investigated for treatment of infection caused by viruses. Therapeutic biologics are designed to activate the immune response to virus or antigens. Typically, biologics do not target [[metabolic pathway]]s like anti-viral drugs, but stimulate immune cells such as [[lymphocytes]], [[macrophages]], and/or [[antigen presenting cell]]s, in an effort to drive an immune response towards a [[cytotoxic]] effect against the virus. Influenza models, such as murine influenza, are convenient models to test the effects of prophylactic and therapeutic biologics. For example, [[Lymphocyte T-Cell Immune Modulator]] inhibits viral growth in the murine model of influenza.<ref>{{cite journal |year=2008 |title=Lymphocyte T-Cell Immunomodulator: Review of the ImmunoPharmacology of a new Veterinary Biologic |journal=Journal of Applied Research in Veterinary Medicine |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=61<U+2013>68 | url=http://jarvm.com/articles/Vol6Iss2/Vol6Iss2Gingerich61-68.pdf |format=PDF | accessdate=5 December 2010 |author=Gingerich, DA }}</ref>

{{further2|[[Influenzavirus A]], [[H5N1]] and [[Transmission and infection of H5N1]]}}

Influenza infects many animal species, and transfer of viral strains between species can occur. [[Bird]]s are thought to be the main [[host (biology)|animal reservoirs]] of influenza viruses.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gorman O, Bean W, Kawaoka Y, Webster R |title=Evolution of the nucleoprotein gene of influenza A virus |pmc=249282 |journal=J Virol |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=1487<U+2013>97 |year=1990 |pmid=2319644}}</ref> Sixteen forms of [[hemagglutinin]] and nine forms of [[neuraminidase]] have been identified. All known subtypes (HxNy) are found in birds, but many subtypes are endemic in humans, [[dog]]s, [[horse]]s, and [[pig]]s; populations of [[camel]]s, [[ferret]]s, [[cat]]s, [[pinniped|seals]], [[mink]], and [[whale]]s also show evidence of prior infection or exposure to influenza.<ref name=webster/> Variants of flu virus are sometimes named according to the species the strain is endemic in or adapted to. The main variants named using this convention are: [[Avian influenza|Bird Flu]], [[Human flu|Human Flu]], [[Swine flu|Swine Flu]], [[Horse flu|Horse Flu]] and [[Dog flu|Dog Flu]]. ([[Cat flu]] generally refers to [[Feline viral rhinotracheitis]] or [[Feline calicivirus]] and not infection from an influenza virus.) In pigs, horses and dogs, influenza symptoms are similar to humans, with cough, fever and [[Anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]].<ref name=webster/> The frequency of animal diseases are not as well-studied as human infection, but an outbreak of influenza in harbor seals caused approximately 500 seal deaths off the [[New England]] coast in 1979<U+2013>1980.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hinshaw V, Bean W, Webster R, Rehg J, Fiorelli P, Early G, Geraci J, St Aubin D |title=Are seals frequently infected with avian influenza viruses? |pmc=255856 |journal=J Virol |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=863<U+2013>5 |year=1984 |pmid=6471169}}</ref> On the other hand, outbreaks in pigs are common and do not cause severe mortality.<ref name=webster/> [[influenza vaccine|Vaccines]] have also been developed to protect [[poultry]] from [[avian influenza]].

An avian-adapted, highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 (called HPAI A(H5N1), for "highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of type A of subtype H5N1") causes [[transmission and infection of H5N1|H5N1 flu]], commonly known as "avian influenza" or simply "bird flu", and is [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in many bird populations, especially in [[Southeast Asia]]. This Asian lineage strain of HPAI A(H5N1) is [[global spread of H5N1|spreading globally]]. It is [[epizootic]] (an epidemic in non-humans) and panzootic (a disease affecting animals of many species, especially over a wide area), killing tens of millions of birds and spurring the [[culling]] of hundreds of millions of other birds in an attempt to control its spread. Most references in the media to "bird flu" and most references to H5N1 are about this specific strain.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Li K, Guan Y, Wang J, Smith G, Xu K, Duan L, Rahardjo A, Puthavathana P, Buranathai C, Nguyen T, Estoepangestie A, Chaisingh A, Auewarakul P, Long H, Hanh N, Webby R, Poon L, Chen H, Shortridge K, Yuen K, Webster R, Peiris J |title=Genesis of a highly pathogenic and potentially pandemic H5N1 influenza virus in eastern Asia |journal=Nature |volume=430 |issue=6996 |pages=209<U+2013>13 |year=2004 |pmid=15241415 | doi=10.1038/nature02746|bibcode = 2004Natur.430..209L }}</ref><ref>Li KS, Guan Y, Wang J, Smith GJ, Xu KM, Duan L, Rahardjo AP, Puthavathana P, Buranathai C, Nguyen TD, Estoepangestie AT, Chaisingh A, Auewarakul P, Long HT, Hanh NT, Webby RJ, Poon LL, Chen H, Shortridge KF, Yuen KY, Webster RG, Peiris JS.

These cases include three small family clusters in Shanghai and one cluster between a neighboring girl and boy in Beijing, raising at least the possibility of human-to-human transmission.  WHO points out that one cluster did not have two of the cases lab confirmed and further points out, as a matter of baseline information, that some viruses are able to cause limited human-to-human transmission under conditions of close contact but are not transmissible enough to cause large community outbreaks.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Health/bird-flu-spreads-china-unclear/story?id=18987118 Deadly Bird Flu Spreading in China, Unclear How], ABC News, Katie Moisse, 18 April 2013.</ref><ref>[http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/latest_update_h7n9/en/index.html Background and summary of human infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus<U+2013> as of 5 April 2013], World Health Organization.</ref>

In 2009, a swine-origin [[H1N1]] virus strain commonly referred to as "swine flu" caused the [[2009 flu pandemic]], but there is no evidence that it is endemic to pigs (i.e. actually a swine flu) or of transmission from pigs to people, instead the virus is spreading from person to person.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oie.int/eng/press/en_090427.htm|title=Press Release: A/H1N1 influenza like human illness in Mexico and the USA: OIE statement|author=Maria Zampaglione |publisher=[[World Organisation for Animal Health]] |date=29 April 2009 |accessdate=29 April 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090430105521/http://www.oie.int/eng/press/en_090427.htm <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=30 April 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/01/health/01name.html |title=W.H.O.
