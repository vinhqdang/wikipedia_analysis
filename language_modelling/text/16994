'''The Most Illustrious Order of Saint Patrick''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[order of chivalry]] associated with [[Ireland]]. The Order was created in 1783 by [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. The regular creation of knights of [[Saint Patrick]] lasted until 1921, when most of Ireland became independent as the [[Irish Free State]]. While the Order technically still exists, no knight of St Patrick has been created since 1936, and the last surviving knight, [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]], died in 1974. [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|The Queen]], however, remains the Sovereign of the Order, and one officer, the [[Norroy and Ulster King of Arms|Ulster King of Arms]] (now combined with Norroy King of Arms), also survives. [[Saint Patrick|St Patrick]] is [[patron saint|patron]] of the order; its motto is ''[[Quis separabit?]]'', or [[Latin]] for "Who will separate us?": an allusion to the [[Vulgate]] translation of [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 8:35, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?"<ref>According to Galloway (pp 171<U+2013>2), the motto was borrowed from the [[Order of the Friendly Brothers of St Patrick]], but was also appropriate politically in expressing a desire for unity</ref>

Most British orders of chivalry cover the entire kingdom, but the three most exalted ones each pertain to one [[constituent nation]] only. The Order of St Patrick, which pertains to Ireland, is the most junior of these three in precedence and age. Its equivalent in [[England]], [[Order of the Garter|The Most Noble Order of the Garter]], is the oldest order of chivalry in the [[United Kingdom]], dating to the middle fourteenth century. The [[Scotland|Scottish]] equivalent is [[Order of the Thistle|The Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle]], dating in its modern form to 1687.

== History ==
[[Image:Order of St Patrick installation banquet.jpg|left|thumb|The installation dinner for the founding of the order took place on 17 March 1783 in the Great Hall of Dublin Castle.]]
=== Early history ===
The Order was founded in 1783, a year after the grant of substantial autonomy to Ireland, as a means of rewarding (or obtaining) political support in the [[Irish Parliament]].<ref name="royal">{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page4880.asp |title=Monarchy Today: Queen and Public: Honours: Order of St Patrick |accessdate=2006-12-03 |work=Official website of the British Monarchy }}</ref> The [[Order of the Bath]], founded in 1725, was instituted for similar reasons. The statutes of the Order restricted membership to men who were both [[knights]] and [[gentlemen]], the latter being defined as having three generations of "noblesse" (i.e. ancestors bearing coats of arms) on both their father's and mother's side.<ref>1783 Statutes, Article III, quoted in Nicolas, p9. The 1905 Statutes, quoted in Galloway p281ff, remove these restrictions on membership.</ref> In practice however only [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish Peers]] (and occasionally foreign princes) were ever appointed to the Order. The cross of St Patrick (a red saltire on a white background) was chosen as one of the symbols of the Order. A [[Flag of St. Patrick|flag of this design]] was later incorporated into the [[Union Flag]]. Its association with St. Patrick or with Ireland prior to the foundation of the Order is unclear, however.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ie-stpat.html |title= Origin of the St. Patrick's Cross Flag|accessdate=2006-12-17|work=Flags of the World|author=Vincent Morley }}</ref> One of the first knights was the [[William FitzGerald, 2nd Duke of Leinster|2nd Duke of Leinster]], whose arms carry the same cross.<ref>See Image:Duke of Leinster coa.png</ref>
[[Image:Irishcrownjewels.jpg|thumb|250px|The Irish Crown Jewels]]
The Order of St Patrick earned international coverage when, in 1907, its insignia, known generally as the [[Irish Crown Jewels]], were stolen from [[Dublin Castle]] shortly before a visit by the Order's Sovereign, King [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]. Their whereabouts remain a mystery.

=== Post-1922 ===
The Irish Executive Council under [[W. T. Cosgrave]] chose not to keep appointing people to the Order when the [[Irish Free State]] left the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] in 1922.<ref name="royal" /> Since then, only three people have been appointed to the Order. All were members of the [[British Royal Family]]. The then [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] (the future King Edward VIII and later Duke of Windsor) was appointed in 1927<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=33282|startpage=3711|date=7 June 1927|accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref><ref>According to Galloway, p155, neither Cosgrave or his government registered any protest, possibly because they had no objection</ref> and his younger brothers, [[Henry, Duke of Gloucester]] in 1934<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=34065|supp=yes|startpage=4137|date=29 June 1934|accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref> and [[George VI of the United Kingdom|Albert, Duke of York]] (later King George VI) in 1936.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=34265|startpage=1738|date=17 March 1936|accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref> The Duke of Gloucester at his death in 1974 was the last surviving member of the Order. It has however never actually been abolished and its resurrection has been discussed in Irish government circles on a number of occasions.

=== Possible revival ===
[[File:Order of St Patrick collar vector.svg|thumb|right|Collar of the Order of St Patrick]]
[[Winston Churchill]] suggested reviving the Order in 1943 to recognise the services of [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|General Harold Alexander]] in [[Tunisia]], but the opinion of the other [[Minister of the Crown|ministers]] and civil servants was that it would upset the diplomatic balance between London and Dublin.<ref>Galloway, pp152<U+2013>6</ref> [[Taoiseach]] [[Se<U+00E1>n Lemass]] considered reviving the Order during the 1960s, but did not take a decision.<ref name="TOL">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2091-1869734_1,00.html|title=Focus: Does Ireland need its own awards?|publisher=Sunday Times Ireland|date=2005-11-13|accessdate=7 December 2006 | location=London | first=Hannah | last=Devlin}}</ref>

It is possible, but highly unlikely, for the British [[monarch]] to revive the Order unilaterally. It is also possible that the British monarch and the [[Irish government]] could re-establish the Order as a part of a joint [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|Anglo]]-[[Irish honours system]]. The Irish ''[[Sunday Independent]]'' newspaper published an article in July 2004 urging the resurrection of the Order and the conferring of membership of the order jointly by the [[President of Ireland]] and the British monarch to individuals who had distinguished themselves in the field of [[Anglo-Irish]] relations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=36&si=1209501&issue_id=11094|title=An honours system? Yes, let's have one|publisher=Sunday Independent|author=Jim Duffy|date=2004-07-04|accessdate=7 December 2006}}</ref> Other publications also made similar suggestions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/1999/03/08/ihead.htm|title=Irish achievers may get knighthood-type honour|author=John O'Mahony|publisher=The Examiner:Irish News|date=1999-03-08|accessdate=8 December 2006}}</ref>

The [[Constitution of Ireland]] provides, "Titles of nobility shall not be conferred by the State" (Article 40.1) and "No title of nobility or of honour may be accepted by any citizen except with the prior approval of the Government" (Article 40.2). Legal experts are divided on whether this clause prohibits the awarding of membership of the Order of St Patrick to Irish citizens, but some suggest that the phrase "titles of nobility" implies hereditary peerages and other noble titles, not lifetime honours such as knighthoods.<ref name="TOL" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0148/S.0148.199610170009.html|title=Seanad <U+00C9>ireann - Volume 148 - National Cultural Institutions Bill, 1996: Second Stage|date=1996-10-17|publisher=Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas|accessdate=11 December 2006}}</ref> In any case, an [[Irish citizen]] would require the approval of the [[Government of Ireland]] to receive an award from a reigning monarch of the [[United Kingdom]] in this manner.

== Composition ==
=== Members ===
[[Image:William Parsons Earl of Rosse.jpg|right|thumb|The astronomer [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse]] wearing the riband and star of the Order]]
The British monarch is Sovereign of the Order of St Patrick. The [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], the monarch's representative in Ireland, served as the Grand Master.<ref>1783 Statutes, Article II, quoted in Nicolas, p9</ref> The office of Lord Lieutenant was abolished in 1922; the last Lord Lieutenant and Grand Master was [[Edmund Fitzalan-Howard, 1st Viscount Fitzalan of Derwent]].<ref>Galloway, p103</ref>

The Order originally consisted of fifteen knights in addition to the Sovereign.<ref>Preamble to 1783 Statutes, quoted in Nicolas, p9. According to Galloway, p17, it was intended that there be 16 knights in addition to the Sovereign, but George III decided to take one of the 16 stalls which had been allotted in the chapel for himself.</ref> In 1821, however, [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] appointed six additional knights;<ref>Nicolas, p37</ref> he did not issue a [[Royal Warrant]] authorising the change until 1830. [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] formally changed the statutes in 1833, increasing the limit to twenty-two knights.<ref>Galloway, p269</ref>

The original statutes, based heavily on those of the Order of the Garter, prescribed that any vacancy should be filled by the Sovereign upon the nomination of the members. Each Knight was to propose nine candidates, of whom three had to have the rank of [[Earl]] or higher, three the rank of [[Baron]] or higher, and three the rank of [[Knight]] or higher, and a vote taken. In practice this system was never used; the Grand Master would nominate a Peer, the Sovereign would usually assent, and a chapter meeting held at which the knights "elected" the new member.<ref>Galloway, p26</ref> The Order of St Patrick differed from its English and Scottish counterparts, the [[Order of the Garter|Orders of the Garter]] and the [[Order of the Thistle|Thistle]], in only ever appointing peers and princes. Women were never admitted to the Order of St Patrick; they were not eligible to become members of the other two orders until 1987. The only woman to be part of the Order was [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] as Sovereign of the Order. Although associated with the established Church of Ireland until 1871, several Catholics were appointed to the order throughout its history.<ref>For example [[Thomas O'Hagan, 1st Baron O'Hagan]], and [[Thomas Southwell, 4th Viscount Southwell]]. According to Galloway, p69, the first Roman Catholic was appointed to the Order in 1821.</ref>

=== Officers ===
The Order of St Patrick initially had thirteen officers: the Prelate, the Chancellor, the Registrar, the Usher, the Secretary, the Genealogist, the [[King of Arms]], two [[herald]]s and four [[pursuivant]]s.<ref>Galloway, p27</ref> Many of these offices were held by clergymen of the [[Church of Ireland]], then [[established church]]. After the disestablishment of the Church in 1871, the ecclesiastics were allowed to remain in office until their deaths, when the offices were either abolished or reassigned to lay officials.<ref>Warrant dated 14 July 1871, quoted in Galloway, p249</ref> All offices except that of Registrar and King of Arms are now vacant.

The office of Prelate was held by the [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]], the most senior clergyman in the Church of Ireland. The Prelate was not mentioned in the original statutes, but created by a warrant shortly afterwards, apparently because the Archbishop at the time had asked to be appointed to the post.<ref>Galloway, p28.</ref> Since the death of the last holder in 1885, the office of Prelate has remained vacant.<ref name="disestablishment">Galloway, pp 249<U+2013>50, 277</ref>

The Church of Ireland's second highest cleric, the [[Archbishop of Dublin (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Dublin]], originally served as the Chancellor of the Order. From 1886 onwards, the office was held instead by the [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]]. Since the abolition of the position of Chief Secretary in 1922, the office of Chancellor has remained vacant.<ref name="disestablishment" />

The Dean of [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]] was originally the Registrar of the Order. In 1890, on the death of the Dean who had held the post in at the time of disestablishment, the office was attached to that of the King of Arms of the Order.<ref name="disestablishment" /> This position was held by [[Ulster King of Arms]], Ireland's chief heraldic official, a post which had been created in 1552. In 1943, this post was in effect divided in two, reflecting the [[partition of Ireland]] in the ''[[Government of Ireland Act]], 1920''. The position, insofar as it related to [[Northern Ireland]], was combined with that of [[Norroy King of Arms]] (who had heraldic jurisdiction in the north of England). The post of [[Norroy and Ulster King of Arms]] still exists, and thus continues to hold the offices of Registrar and King of Arms of the Order of St Patrick. The office of [[Ulster King of Arms]], insofar as it related to the [[Irish Free State]] (now the [[Republic of Ireland]]), became the position of [[Chief Herald of Ireland]].

The Order of St Patrick had six other heraldic officers, many more than any other British order. The two heralds were known as Cork Herald and Dublin Herald. Three of the four pursuivancies were untitled, the fourth was held by [[Athlone Pursuivant]], an office founded in 1552.<ref>Galloway, pp 27, 31</ref>

The Usher of the Order was "the Usher at Arms named the Black Rod".<ref>1783 Statutes, Article XVII, quoted in Nicolas, p15</ref> The [[Irish Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod]] was distinct from the [[Black Rod|English officer of the same name]], though like his counterpart he had some duties in the Irish House of Lords.<ref>Galloway, p29</ref> (The latter continues to serve as Usher to the Order of the Garter and as Serjeant-at-Arms of the [[House of Lords]].) The Irish post has been vacant since 1933.

The offices of Secretary and Genealogist were originally held by members of the Irish House of Commons. The office of Secretary has been vacant since 1926. The position of Genealogist was left vacant in 1885, restored in 1889, but left vacant again in 1930.<ref>Galloway, p252</ref>

== Vestments and accoutrements ==
[[Image:Knight of the Order of St Patrick.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Ernest Augustus I of Hanover]] in the mantle of a Knight of the Order]]
[[Image:Badges of the Order of St Patrick.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The badge of the Order. The statutes of the Order prescribed a sky-blue riband; the exact shade of blue used varied over time.]]
For important occasions, such as [[coronation of the British monarch|coronations]] and investitures of new members of the Order, Knights of St Patrick wore elaborate vestments:
* The ''mantle'' was a celestial blue robe lined with white silk. The star of the Order (see below) was depicted on the left of the mantle. A blue hood was attached to the mantle.<ref name="vestments">1783 Statutes, ''Ordinances touching the Badges, Devices and Habits of our Knights Companion of our Most Illustrious order of St Patrick'', quoted in Nicholas pp16<U+2013>17</ref>
* The ''hat'' of the Order was originally of white satin, lined with blue, but was changed to black velvet by [[George IV of Great Britain|George IV]]. It was plumed with three falls of feathers, one red, one white and one blue.<ref name="vestments" />
* The ''collar'' was made of gold, consisting of [[Tudor rose]]s and harps attached with knots. The two roses which comprise the Tudor rose were alternately enamelled white within red, and red within white. The central harp, from which the badge of the Order was suspended, was surmounted by a crown.<ref name="vestments"/>

On certain "[[Collar day|collar days]]" designated by the Sovereign, members attending formal events wore the Order's collar over their military uniform, formal day dress, or evening wear. When collars were worn (either on collar days or on formal occasions such as coronations), the badge was suspended from the collar.

Aside from these special occasions, however, much simpler accoutrements were used:
* The ''star'' of the Order was an eight-pointed figure, with the four cardinal points longer than the intermediate points. Each point was shown as a cluster of rays. In the centre was the same motto, year and design that appeared on the badge. The star was worn pinned to the left breast.
* The ''broad riband'' was a celestial blue sash worn across the body, from the right shoulder to the left hip.<ref name="riband">1783 Statutes, article V, quoted in Nicolas, p10</ref>
* The ''badge'' was pinned to the riband at the right hip. Made of gold, it depicted a shamrock bearing three crowns, on top of a cross of St Patrick and surrounded by a blue circle bearing the motto in majusclues, as well as the date of the Order's foundation in Roman numerals ("MDCCLXXXIII").<ref name="riband"/>

The Grand Master's insignia were of the same form and design as those of the Knights. In 1831, however, William IV presented the Grand Master with a star and badge, each composed of [[ruby|rubies]], [[emerald]]s and [[diamond|Brazilian diamonds]]. These two insignia became known as the [[Irish Crown Jewels]]. They, along with five collars belonging to Knights, were famously stolen in 1907; they have not since been recovered.<ref name="DCH">{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincastle.ie/history12.html|title=Dublin Castle - History: The Illustrious Order of St. Patrick|year=2002|publisher=Dublin Castle|accessdate=7 December 2006|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061207172622/http://www.dublincastle.ie/history12.html |archivedate = December 07, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

A number of items pertaining to the Order of St Patrick are held in museums in the Republic of Ireland and [[Northern Ireland]]. The robes of [[Luke Gerald Dillon, 4th Baron Clonbrock]], the 122nd Knight of the Order are on display in the [[National Museum of Ireland]], Dublin; the robe belonging to [[Francis Charles Needham, 3rd Earl of Kilmorey]] is held by the [[Newry Museum]]; the [[National Gallery of Ireland|National Gallery]] and [[National Library of Ireland|Genealogical Museum]] in Dublin both have Stars of the Order; and the National Museum and Galleries of Northern Ireland Ulster Museum has a large collection on display and two mantles in storage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.downcountymuseum.com/uploads/2001_Robe_Of_Order_of_St_Patrick.doc|title=A Robe of the Order of St Patrick|author=Noreen Cunningham and Madeleine McAllister|date=|accessdate=7 December 2006}}</ref> The [[Irish Guards]] take their capstar and motto from the Order.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/irishguards/regiment_today/index.htm|title=Irish Guards: The Regiment Today|publisher=Ministry of Defence|year=2004|accessdate=7 December 2006|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060728091527/http://www.army.mod.uk/irishguards/regiment_today/index.htm |archivedate = July 28, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

== Chapel and Chancery ==
[[Image:Stpatrickcathedral dublin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|St Patrick's Cathedral was the Chapel of the Order.]]
The Chapel of the Order was originally in St Patrick's Cathedral, [[Dublin]].<ref>1783 Statutes, article VII, quoted in Nicolas, p11</ref> Each member of the Order, including the Sovereign, was allotted a stall in the [[Cathedral diagram|choir]] of the Chapel, above which his (or her, in the case of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]) heraldic devices were displayed. Perched on the pinnacle of a knight's stall was a helm, decorated with [[mantling]] and topped by his crest. Above the crest, the knight's heraldic [[banner]] was hung, emblazoned with his [[coat of arms]]. At a considerably smaller scale, to the back of the stall was affixed a piece of brass (a "stall plate") displaying its occupant's name, arms and date of admission into the Order. Upon the death of a Knight, the banner and crest were taken down and replaced with those of his successor. After the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1871, the Chapel ceased to be used; the heraldic devices of the knights at the time were left in place at the request of Queen Victoria.<ref>Galloway, p67</ref>

The Order was without a ceremonial home until 1881 when arrangements were made to display banners, helms and [[hatchment]] plates (the equivalent of stall plates, in the absence of stalls) in the Great Hall of [[Dublin Castle]].<ref>Galloway, p70</ref> On the establishment of the Irish Free State the banners of the living knights were removed. When the Hall was redecorated in 1962 it was decided that it should be hung with the banners of the members of the Order in 1922. The existing banners were repaired or new ones made; it is these banners which can be seen today.<ref>Galloway, p202</ref> The Hall, which was renamed St Patrick's Hall from its association with the Order, also served as the Chancery of the Order. Installation ceremonies, and later investitures, were held here, often on [[Saint Patrick's Day|St Patrick's Day]], until they were discontinued. A banquet for the Knights was often held in the Hall on the occasion of an installation. St Patrick's Hall now serves as the location for the inauguration of the [[President of Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web

Unlike many of the other British Orders the stall plates (or hatchment plates) do not form a continuous record of the Knights of the Order. There are only 34 stall plates for the 80 or so knights appointed before 1871, (although others were destroyed in a fire in 1940), and 40 hatchments plates for the 60 knights appointed subsequently. In the case of the stall plates this was perhaps due to the their size, 30x36 cm (12x14 in).<ref>Galloway, pp201<U+2013>209</ref>

== Precedence and privileges ==
[[Image:Order of St Patrick 2006 Kaihsu Tai.jpg|thumb|right|A panel recording some members of the Order of St Patrick in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin.]]
Since the members of the Order were required to be knights, and in practice had higher rank, many of the privileges of membership were rendered moot. As knights they could prefix "Sir" to their forenames, but the form was never used in speech, as they were referred to by their peerage dignities. They were assigned positions in the [[Order of precedence in England and Wales|order of precedence]], but had higher positions by virtue of their peerage dignities.

Knights used the post-nominal letters "KP". When an individual was entitled to use multiple post-nominal letters, KP appeared before all others, except "Bt" ([[Baronet]]), "VC" ([[Victoria Cross]]), "GC" ([[George Cross]]), "KG" ([[Knight of the Garter]]) and "KT" ([[Knight of the Thistle]]).

Knights could encircle their arms with a depiction of the circlet (a blue circle bearing the motto) and the collar; the former is shown either outside or on top of the latter. The badge is depicted suspended from the collar.<ref>The 1783 statutes only mention encircling the arms with the collar and badge of the Order. The 1905 Statutes, article XX (quoted in Galloway, p282) mention the circlet and supporters as well.</ref> They were also entitled to receive heraldic [[supporters]].<ref>1905 Statutes, article XXI, quoted in Galloway, p282</ref> This high privilege was, and is, only shared by members of the Royal Family, peers, Knights and Ladies of the Garter, Knights and Ladies of the Thistle, and Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the junior orders. (Of course, Knights of St Patrick, all being members of the Royal Family or peers, were entitled to supporters in any event.)<ref>Woodcock and Robinson, p93</ref>
