'''Tropical Storm Dean''' was a strong tropical storm that affected at least twelve islands along its path from the tropical [[Atlantic Ocean]] to east of [[Atlantic Canada]]. Dean developed from a [[tropical wave]] on August 22 over the [[Lesser Antilles]], and was initially predicted to intensify further to reach hurricane status. However, strong [[wind shear]] quickly weakened Dean to cause it to dissipate on August 23. The remnants turned northward, and redeveloped on August 26 to the north of [[Bermuda]]. Located over warm waters and in an area of favorable conditions, Dean steadily strengthened while moving to the northeast, and peaked just below hurricane status on August 27 about 465&nbsp;miles (750&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. The storm subsequently weakened over cooler waters, and became [[extratropical]] on August 28.

The precursor tropical wave dropped heavy rainfall and produced moderate winds throughout the [[Lesser Antilles]], though no serious damage was reported. In [[Puerto Rico]], rainfall of up to 12.7&nbsp;inches (322&nbsp;mm) produced widespread flooding across the island. Thousands were left without power or water, and two houses lost their roofs from the storm. The passage of Dean resulted in $7.7&nbsp;million (2001&nbsp;USD, $9.4&nbsp;million 2008&nbsp;&nbsp;USD) in damage in Puerto Rico. The storm produced light to moderate rainfall in [[Bermuda]] and later in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], though no damage was reported.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Dean 2001 track.png}}
A large tropical wave with minimal convection moved off the coast of [[Africa]] near [[Dakar]] between August 14 and August 15. It moved westward, and gradually developed thunderstorms across the wave axis.<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Lixion Avila|date=2001-10-03|title=Tropical Storm Dean Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2011-12-03|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2001dean.html}}</ref> On August 21, while located about 450&nbsp;miles (725&nbsp;km) east of the [[Lesser Antilles]], convection increased further within the system, though unfavorable upper-level [[wind shear]] prevented rapid development.<ref name="aug22two">{{cite web|author=Stacy Stewart|date=2001-08-21|title=August 21 Tropical Weather Outlook|publisher=National Hurricane|accessdate=2011-12-03|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-A/2001/Aug/2001082109.ABNT20}}</ref> It continued to become better organized, and though a [[Hurricane Hunters|Reconnaissance flight]] into the system reported strong winds, it lacked a surface circulation.

Dean was upgraded directly to a tropical storm due to the presence of 50&nbsp;mph (80&nbsp;km/h) winds in the storm.<ref name="tcr"/>

Reconnaissance Aircraft and surface reports confirmed the existence of a circulation. Dean moved northwestward at 22&nbsp;mph (35&nbsp;km/h), under the influence of the [[anticyclone|Bermuda High]] to its northeast. The storm strengthened slightly to reach winds of 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h) later on August 22, though the circulation was exposed on the western edge of the convection due to the storm's quick forward motion and persistent [[wind shear]]. Initial forecasts predicted the shear to decrease, allowing Dean to attain hurricane status with winds of over 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="dean1">{{cite web|author=Jack Beven|date=2001-08-22|title=Tropical Storm Dean Discussion One|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2011-12-03|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2001/dis/al052001.discus.001.html}}</ref> However, an upper-level [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] produced an increase of shear over the storm, and by August 23 Dean weakened to a tropical depression. Hours later, the circulation dissipated, and Dean degenerated into a tropical wave to the east of the [[Bahamas]].<ref name="tcr"/> Regeneration was considered unlikely at the time.<ref name="beven5">{{cite web|author=Jack Beven|date=2001-08-23|title=Tropical Depression Dean Discussion Five|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2011-12-03|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2001/dis/al052001.discus.005.html}}</ref>

==Impact and preparations==
===Caribbean===
About a day before Dean developed, the National Hurricane Center advised interests in the northern and central [[Lesser Antilles]] to monitor the progress of the storm.<ref name="aug22two"/> Routine statements issued by the National Hurricane Center warned for the possibility of strong winds and heavy rains. However, because Dean formed after it passed the islands, no [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical cyclone warnings or watches]] were issued.<ref name="tcr"/> The precursor disturbance dropped heavy rainfall on [[Saint Martin]] of around 5&nbsp;inches (129&nbsp;mm).<ref name="wmo">{{cite web|author=World Meteorological Organization|year=2002|title=Reports of hurricanes, tropical storms, tropical disturbances and related flooding during 2001|accessdate=2006-11-07|url=http://www.wmo.ch/web/www/TCP/MEETING/RA%20IV%20HC-24/doc14.doc}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> 

[[Image:TS Dean (2001).JPG|right|thumb|200px|Tropical Storm Dean shortly after forming]]
The precursor disturbance to Tropical Storm Dean produced 1.07&nbsp;inches (27&nbsp;mm) of rain in [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]], where winds reached 40&nbsp;mph (64&nbsp;km/h) with gusts to 48&nbsp;mph (77&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="tcr"/> On [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Croix]], the system produced 0.49&nbsp;inches (12&nbsp;mm) of rain and peak wind gusts of 47&nbsp;mph (76&nbsp;km/h). There, minor flooding was reported. Moderate wind gusts downed small trees and branches in Saint Croix and [[Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint John]], and some roads were damaged in Saint John, as well. Heavy rains and gusty winds caused power outages throughout the U.S. Virgin Islands. The passage of Tropical Storm Dean resulted in minor damage totaling to $20,000 (2001&nbsp;USD, $24,400 2008&nbsp;USD).<ref name="usvincdc">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=2001|title=Event Report for Virgin Islands|accessdate=2006-11-07|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~453963}}</ref>

Tropical Storm Dean dropped heavy rainfall across [[Puerto Rico]], peaking at 12.7&nbsp;inches (322&nbsp;mm) in [[Salinas, Puerto Rico|Salinas]]. Winds were generally light across the island. The passage of Dean resulted in widespread flooding in eastern and southern Puerto Rico, collapsing two bridges and one road. Several highways were under water, and one car was swept away by the floodwaters. The four inside the vehicle were later rescued and unharmed. Throughout the island, about 1,320&nbsp;houses were flooded, and two houses experienced collapsed roofs. The rains left various towns without power or water.<ref name="prncdc">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=2001|title=Event Report for Puerto Rico|accessdate=2006-11-07|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~454073}}</ref> By the night after the storm passed the island, more than 16,000 were without power, while almost 70,000 lacked potable water.

===Bahamas, Bermuda, and Canada===
Shortly after Dean formed, the government of the [[Bahamas]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm warning]] for the southeastern Bahamas and the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]].<ref name="tcr"/> When the storm weakened and ultimately dissipated, the warnings were canceled.<ref name="tcr"/> The remnants of Dean produced unsettled conditions across [[Bermuda]], including a wind gust of 41&nbsp;mph (66&nbsp;km/h) and light rainfall of 0.31&nbsp;inches (8&nbsp;mm). The passage of Dean resulted in the coldest day of August 2001 on the island.<ref name="bermy">{{cite web|author=Bermuda Weather Service|year=2001|title=Weather Summary for August 2001|accessdate=2006-11-07|url=http://www.weather.bm/data/2001-08.html}}</ref> Dean produced wind gusts peaking at 63&nbsp;mph (103&nbsp;km/h) in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], along with rainfall up to 4.2&nbsp;inches (107&nbsp;mm) in eastern Newfoundland. On land, wave heights reached 30&nbsp;feet (9.3&nbsp;m), while a [[buoy]] offshore reported a peak wave height of 47&nbsp;feet (14.4&nbsp;m).<ref>{{cite web|author=Canadian Hurricane Centre|date=2010-09-14|title=2001-Dean|accessdate=2010-12-31|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/Hurricane/default.asp?lang=En&n=0E595A90-1}}</ref>
