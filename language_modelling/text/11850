'''COPS''' was the first common [[Unix]] computer system security scanning tool,
created by [[Dan Farmer]]; [[Gene Spafford]] helped him start it in 1989 while Dan was in summer school at [[Purdue University]].

==Features==
COPS integrates around 12 small security check programs which review the security
state of the system it is run on.
These programs look for (from the COPS README.1 file):
* file, directory, and device permissions/nodes
* poor passwords
* content, format, and security of password and group files
* programs and files run in /etc/rc* and cron(tab) files
* existence of root-SUID files, their writability, and whether they are shell scripts
* a CRC check against important binaries or key files
* writability of users home directories and startup files
* anonymous ftp setup
* unrestricted tftp, decode alias in sendmail, SUID uudecode problems, hidden shells inside inetd.conf, rexd in inetd.conf
* miscellaneous root checks -- current directory in the search path, a "+" in the /etc/host.equiv file, unrestricted NFS mounts, ensuring root is in /etc/ftpusers
* checking dates of CERT advisories vs. key files.
* the Kuang expert system

COPS was the forerunner of the [[Security Administrator Tool for Analyzing Networks|SATAN]] network security scan tool.
COPS is generally considered obsolete, but it is not uncommon to find systems which are set up in an insecure manner that COPS will identify.
