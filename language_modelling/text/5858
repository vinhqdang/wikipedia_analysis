The '''Florida State Seminoles''' are the men's and women's sports teams of [[Florida State University]] in [[Tallahassee, Florida]].  Florida State participates in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] (Division I FBS for football).  FSU joined the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] in 1992 and competes in the Atlantic Division for sports split into divisional format.  The athletic director is Colonel [[Randy Spetman]], who was introduced on February 4, 2008.

The Seminoles field 17 teams, 8 men and 9 women and have won 12 team National Titles, over 100 team Conference Titles as well as numerous individual National and Conference Titles.

In 1999, the Seminole Football team became the first national champion to begin the season as the top-ranked team without losing that position for the entire season. Recently, the Men's Outdoor Track and Field team has won three consecutive [[NCAA]] National Titles.

In 1947, students selected the name "Seminoles" (named for the [[Seminole]] tribe of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]]) to represent their university and athletic teams.<ref>http://unirel.fsu.edu/seminoles/pages/timeline.html</ref> Since 1978, the teams have been represented by the symbols [[Chief Osceola and Renegade]]. [[List of sports team names derived from Indigenous peoples|The Native American name]] Osceola is used with official sanction of the [[Seminole|Seminole Tribe of Florida, Inc.]] The unconquered spirit of the Seminole people is a theme that is respected and represented through the athletic teams. The logo, a profile of a Seminole warrior, was created using the actual profile of Thomas Wright, who wrote the Florida State fight song.

==Overview==
Florida State Athletics began in 1902 when the then Florida State College football teams played three seasons.<ref>[http://www.fsu.edu/~fsu150/history/history_06_1980c.html FSU 150th Anniversary - History || Coming of Age || Athletics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The 1905 Buckman Act reorganized the existing seven Florida colleges into three institutions, [[Racial segregation|segregated]] by [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[gender segregation|gender]]. As a result of this reorganization, the coeducational Florida State College was renamed the Florida State College for Women.<ref name="Fountain and Westcott Building at Florida State College for Women">[http://fpc.dos.state.fl.us/reference/rc05025.jpg] ''State Library and Archives of Florida - Florida Photographic Collection, Westcott Building at the Florida State College for Women, published 193-. Archives metadata: Fountain and Westcott Building at Florida State College for Women.'' Retrieved on [[April 29|4-29]]-[[2007]].</ref> The Florida State University became a co-ed institution in 1947 with most of the newly enrolled male students back from service in World War II. Athletic programs quickly resumed and Florida State fielded its first football team in 43 years with FSU facing Stetson on October 18, 1947.

Florida State was a founding member of the [[Dixie_Conference#Dixie_Conference_.281948.29|Dixie Conference]] in 1948 when other southern institutions seeking to create a "purely amateur" athletic conference based on the principle of complete amateurism, with no athletic scholarships. Three years later FSU left the conference to become an independent, having won 3 football, and 2 Men's Track and Field Conference Titles.

In [[1976]] Florida State joined the [[Metro Conference]] in all sports except football, which remained independent. The Metro Conference never sponsored football in the first place. For fifteen years Florida State competed and won 47 conference titles as well as a women's golf National Title, two Softball National Titles and two women's Track and Field National Titles. At the beginning of the [[1992]] academic fall term Florida State joined the Atlantic Coast Conference.

Since the 1991-1992 academic year, Florida State has been a member of the ACC. In [[1993]] and [[1999]] FSU Football won the National Championships. The Men's track and Field team have won three consecutive national titles since 2006. After the 2005 conference expansion was complete FSU was placed in the newly formed Atlantic Division. In the 2005 Inaugural ACC Football Championship game FSU defeated Virginia Tech 27&ndash;22. This is their last of their 12 ACC Football titles to date.

Florida State's school colors of garnet and gold are a merging of the University's past. In 1904 and 1905 the Florida State College won football championships wearing purple and gold uniforms. When FSC became Florida State College for Women in 1905, the FSCW student body selected crimson as the official school color. The administration in 1905 took crimson and combined it with the recognizable purple of the championship football teams to achieve the color garnet. The now-famous garnet and gold colors were first used on an FSU uniform in a 14&ndash;6 loss to Stetson on October 18, 1947.<ref>[http://seminoles.cstv.com/trads/fsu-trads-colors.html Florida State University Official Athletic Site<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

There are 7 men's athletic teams and 10 women's teams currently fielded by FSU. They are:

===Facilities===

[[Image:Doak Campbell416.jpg|thumb|left|Doak Campbell Stadium]]There are two major stadiums and an arena within FSU's main campus. [[Bobby Bowden Field at Doak Campbell Stadium]] named after one of the winningest coaches in Division 1 college football history as well as President Campbell which during his administration was instrumental in beginning the [[Florida-Florida State rivalry]]. Its capacity is around 83,000. [[Mike Martin Field at Dick Howser Stadium]] is the home for Seminole baseball and is named for the long time Seminole skipper, Mike Martin and for former coach Dick Howser, manager for Kansas City, Cleveland, and the New York Yankees as well as returning to coach at Florida State in 1979. The [[Donald L. Tucker Center]] is home for men<U+2019>s and women<U+2019>s basketball.

Mike Long track is the home of the three time National Champion Men<U+2019>s Track and Field team.  The track has undergone a complete revamp and in 2003 a brand new track, complete with a new surface, wider lanes, faster turns and a larger infield area for hosting field events was unveiled. The new Mcintosh Track and Field Building on the corner of Spirit Way and Chieftan Way in the southern end of the track was completed in 2008 weeks before the Seminoles won their third consecutive National Title.

H. Donald Loucks courts at the Speicher Tennis Center is the home for FSU Tennis. The complex was named in honor of Lieutenant Commander Michael Scott Speicher, a graduate of Florida State University and the first American casualty during Operation Desert Storm. By presidential directive, the facility bears the name the "Scott Speicher Tennis Center."

The [[Seminole Soccer Complex]] is home for women<U+2019>s soccer normally holds a capacity of 1,600 people but has seen crowds in excess of 4,500 for certain games. The home record is 4,582 for a game versus Florida.

The Seminole softball plays at the Seminole Softball Complex and the team takes the field that holds the name of the winningest coach in softball history, Dr. JoAnne Graf.

===Rivalries===
Florida State's traditional rivals in all sports include the [[University of Florida Gators]] and the [[University of Miami Hurricanes]]. Florida State University is the only school in the State of Florida to play both the [[Miami Hurricanes]] and [[Florida Gators]] year in and year out in all sports.

The [[Bowden Bowl]] involving Florida State and [[Clemson University]] was played from 1999 to 2007. This gridiron rivalry was played between father [[Bobby Bowden]], head coach at FSU, and his son [[Tommy Bowden]], former head coach at Clemson.  As of October 13, 2008, Clemson University forced the resignation of Tommy Bowden and thus the Bowden Bowl Era faded into history.  FSU & Bobby led the series 5&ndash;4.

Florida State University was founded by Francis Eppes VII, a cousin of [[University of Virginia]] founder Thomas Jefferson. As a result, both teams played for the Jefferson-Eppes trophy in football. With the recent realignment of the divisions in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] the Florida State Seminoles found themselves in one division and the [[Virginia Cavaliers]] in another. The two schools will once again meet in 2010 to renew the rivalry.

FSU enjoys baseball rivalries primarily with the University of Miami and several other ACC teams, including the [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] Yellow Jackets and Clemson University Tigers.

Seminole baseball is one of the most successful [[college baseball|collegiate baseball]] programs in the United States having been to 19 [[College World Series]] in 48 Tournament appearances, and having appeared in the national championship final on three occasions (falling to the [[University of Southern California Trojans]] in 1970, the University of [[Arizona Wildcats]] in 1986, and the University of [[Miami Hurricanes]] in 1999).

Under the command of Head Coach #11 [[Mike Martin (baseball coach)|Mike Martin]] ([[Florida State University|FSU]] [[1966]]), Florida State is the second-winningest program in the history of college baseball. Since 1990, FSU has had more 50 win seasons, headed to more [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Tournaments (19 Regional Tournaments in 20 years), and finished in the top 10 more than any team in the United States. Since [[2000]], FSU is the winningest program in [[college baseball]] with more victories and a higher winning percentage in the regular season than any other school. Despite their regular-season success and winning sixteen conference championships, Florida State is still chasing their first College World Series Championship.

After spotting America<U+2019>s major college basketball programs a 50-year [[Head start (positioning)|head start]], Florida State would be struggling just to catch up. Not so. In just over 50 years, the Seminoles have matched and surpassed many of their older brethren in victories, in 20-win seasons, in NCAA Tournament games and in the individual honors picked up by Florida State players. 

The men's basketball team has enjoyed some modest NCAA Tournament success over the years. Since their first appearance in the NCAA tournament in 1968, the Seminoles have played for the national title in the NCAA championship game in 1972 and advanced to the Sweet 16 round in 1992 and the Elite Eight round in 1993.

Florida State is one of only two ACC schools that have had at least one player selected in each of the last five NBA Drafts. Hearing their names called on recent draft days were [[Tim Pickett]] by the [[New Orleans Hornets]] in 2004, [[Von Wafer]] by the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in 2005, [[Alexander Johnson]] by the [[Indiana Pacers]] in 2006, [[Al Thornton]] by the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] in 2007, [[Toney Douglas]] by the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] (then traded to the [[New York Knicks]]) in 2009, [[Solomon Alabi]] by the [[Dallas Mavericks]] (then traded to the [[Toronto Raptors]]) in 2010 and [[Ryan Reid]] by the [[Indiana Pacers]] (then traded to the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]) in 2010. A total of 37 Seminoles have been selected in the NBA Draft including seven first round picks. Among those first round selections are Dave Cowens, one of the greatest centers in NBA history, and George McCloud, the first lottery selection in school history. Today, five Seminoles are on NBA rosters and 16 have played in the league in the last 17 years.<ref name="Media Guide of Men's B-ball">{{cite web|url=http://graphics.fansonly.com/schools/fsu/graphics/mediaguides/06-mbb/2006-07universitysection.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=Seminoles.com |title=Profile: Men's Basketball|accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref>

In the 2004&ndash;05, 2005&ndash;06, and 2006&ndash;07 seasons, FSU recorded 20 or more wins, finished 4th in the ACC regular season standings, and advanced to the NCAA Women's Tournament each year. In the 2005&ndash;06 season, FSU entered the USA Today/ESPN Coaches Poll for the first time at No. 19.  The Seminoles earned a #6 seed in the 2005&ndash;06 NCAA Women's Tournament. In the 2006&ndash;07 season, Florida State advanced to its first NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 in school history with a 68-61 victory at Stanford. The FSU women ended the 2007&ndash;08 season with 19 wins, following a 2nd round NCAA loss to Oklahoma State in overtime by just one point.

[[Image:Florida State rc01140.jpg|thumb|left|Florida State College football 1902]] In 1902, the Florida State College in Tallahassee fielded its first football team. The program posted a record of 7&ndash;6&ndash;1 over the next three seasons, including a record of 3&ndash;1 against their rivals from the [[University of Florida]] (formerly Florida Agricultural College) in [[Lake City, Florida|Lake City]]. In 1904, the Florida State football team became the first ever state champions of Florida after beating both the [[University of Florida]] and [[Stetson University]]. In 1905, however, the Florida higher education system was reorganized, creating the new University of Florida, in [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]], and the Florida State College for Women, in Tallahassee. All male students, including the football team, were moved to the Gainesville campus.

With the formation of Florida State University in 1947, the school once again started a football team. After its first year, FSU joined the Dixie Conference, which it won in each of the three years it was a member. It left the conference in 1951 and competed as an independent team for the next forty years.<ref name="CFBDW">{{cite web|url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/acc/florida_state/championships.php |publisher=College Football Data Warehouse |title=Florida State Historical Data|accessdate=2007-12-15}}</ref>

The Seminoles are the second winningest team in college football since 1990 behind the first ranked University of Florida Gators. The Seminoles are currently coached by [[Jimbo Fisher]].

Before former FSU Football head coach [[Bobby Bowden]] retired, he was five victories behind Penn State's [[Joe Paterno]] as the NCAA Division I (BCS).

===The Sod Cemetery===
[[Image:Fsusod1.JPG|thumb|left|Florida State Football's Sod Cemetery is the final resting place for 75 "Sod Games"]]In 1962, the FSU football team captains returned to Tallahassee with a piece of the turf from Sanford Stadium after defeating Georgia 18-0 in Athens. The turf was presented to Dean Coyle E. Moore who founded the tradition of the sod game.

The sod cemetery began when the first piece of sod was buried in the corner of the Florida State practice field and a monument was placed to commemorate the road victory. In the early years, FSU only snipped grass when it won by upset on the road. But as the Seminoles became more successful, the criteria changed. Sod games still represent road games won when FSU is a significant underdog, however, all bowl games are now considered sod games as well as landmark road wins no matter who was favored. Each piece of sod is buried in the cemetery next to the practice field and a tombstone is placed above it with the score and date of the game.<ref name="Sod Cemetery">{{cite web|url=http://seminoles.cstv.com/trads/fsu-trads-cemetery.html|title=''Sod Cemetery'' |accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref>

===Bobby Bowden Field at Doak Campbell Stadium===
{{Main|Bobby Bowden Field at Doak Campbell Stadium}}
[[Image:Stadium 0279 (117).jpg|thumb|left|Langford Green at University Center]]The stadium, named after former Florida State President Doak S. Campbell, hosted its first game against the [[Randolph-Macon College]] [[Yellowjacket]]s on October 7, 1950 with the Seminoles winning the game 40&ndash;7. At that time the facility had a seating capacity of 15,00. Florida State began to play at '''Centennial  Field''' during the team's inaugural 1947 season and would continue to play there for the following two years (1948 and 1949). The stadium has expanded numerous times; from 15,000 seats to 19,000 in 1954, to 25,000 in 1961 and to 40,500 between the years 1960 and 1970. Since that time, the stadium has expanded to almost 83,000, largely in part to the success of the football team under head coach [[Bobby Bowden]] coupled with the ever growing student body. It now is the largest football stadium in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and the fourteenth largest stadium in the NCAA.

==Harkins Field==
[[Image:HarkinsFieldFSU.JPG|thumb|left|Bill Harkins Field]] Harkins Field is an artificial turf with rubber fill field built near the Flying High Circus. Bill Harkins, head coach of the men's club lacrosse team, was instrumental in the field's design and construction. Previously the space was a muddy space of land what would frequently flood. The Florida State University Marching Chiefs have the Manley R. Whitcomb Band Complex situated near the field and use it for their practices. Florida State Football uses the field primarily to prepare when they travel to face an opponent with an artificial turf field. The club lacrosse team practices and plays all of its home games at the facility.

Following the program's 25th 40 win season in 2006, Graf 's 1,355 total wins are 149 ahead of the next closest coach. An 8-1 victory over Jacksonville on February 22, 2006, made her only the second coach in NCAA history to record 1,100 NCAA fast pitch wins. In 1999, Florida State received a state-of-the-art softball complex which also houses the Seminole soccer stadium. The result was the creation of one of the nation's premier collegiate joint softball and soccer facilities.

[[Image:JGraf FIield FSU.JPG|thumb|left|JoAnne Graf Field]]Seven trips to the Women<U+2019>s College World Series, 19 NCAA Tournaments, 24 All-Americans, 10 conference titles in 15 years and one of the nations<U+2019> premiere softball facilities and that<U+2019>s just scratching the surface of what it means to play softball at Florida State. From the time FSU won its first national championship in 1981, the nation<U+2019>s best players have come to play for legendary head coach Dr. JoAnne Graf and wear Garnet and Gold.

For over two decades those players have made FSU one of the most dominant softball programs in the history of collegiate softball. Only five teams in the history of the NCAA have been to more WCWS than Florida State and no school east of Arizona has been to more NCAA Tournaments than the Seminoles. Florida State<U+2019>s success on the field is remarkable. The Tribe has never endured a losing sea son in coach Dr. Graf <U+2019>s 28 years as they have won 76% of the 1786 games they have played. Only UCLA has amassed more program wins than Florida State<U+2019>s 1136 since 1984 and the Seminoles have a winning record against over 80% of the 165 opponents they have faced in the program<U+2019>s illustrious 28-year history. Nothing has changed recently either as over the last 15 seasons, FSU has amassed 761 wins or an average of more than 50 victories a season.

JoAnne Graf Field at the Seminole Softball Complex is state-of-the art in every facet and provides Florida State softball players with an all-inclusive complex that includes locker rooms, meeting rooms and one of the best playing surfaces anywhere in the country.

Florida State has posted 217 wins in its eight years at the complex. Even more impressive, FSU has gone 164-36 at the complex the last six years for an amazing .820 winning percentage. The complex was also featured in Athletic Business Magazine<U+2019>s 2002 Architectural Showcase.

Florida State<U+2019>s dream of a new, state-of-the-art softball complex became reality when ground was broken in a ceremony in the spring of 1998. Construction workers worked continuously to complete the facility, which also houses the Seminole soccer stadium. The result was the creation of one of the nation<U+2019>s premier collegiate softball and soccer facilities. The complex, which was completed in the spring of 1999, includes ticket and concessions buildings and spacious press boxes with radio/television booths. The two-level Mary Ann Stiles & Barry Smith Team Building features a reception area, softball and soccer coaches offices, which overlook their respective stadiums, a combined workroom, large team and coaches locker rooms and training and equipment rooms.

On April 2, 2005, university president Dr. T.K. Wetherell and Dave Hart officially renamed the softball stadium <U+201C>JoAnne Graf Field at the Seminole Softball Complex.<U+201D> She joins Bob Heck at Georgia State as the only two active softball coaches with fi lds named after them.
This fall the stadium got a facelift as a Florida State will unveil a brand new video scoreboard for the 2007 season. The board uses the same technology that is used at most outdoor professional stadiums. The ProStar is capable of displaying video clips, live video, animation, player head shots, graphics and statistics in 4.3 trillion colors.

The Seminole Softball/Soccer Complex is located in between the Dick Howser Baseball Stadium and the Mike Long Track on Chieftan Way. The facility can be accessed from both Chieftan Way and Stadium Drive.

== Academic cheating scandal ==
In Spring 2007, several FSU athletes, including football players, were accused of cheating in an online music history class. The NCAA ruled that Florida State was guilty of major violations, announced that it would reduce scholarship limits in 10 sports and force Florida State to vacate all of the victories in 2006 and 2007 in which the implicated athletes participated and placed the university on probation for four years.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/07/sports/ncaafootball/07ncaa.html | work=The New York Times | title=N.C.A.A.

On January 5, 2010 the [[NCAA]] Infractions Appeals Committee denied FSU's appeal and ruled that all penalties, including vacating up to fourteen football wins during the 2006-2007 seasons. FSU officials responded that they were surprised and disappointed by the NCAA decision and felt that their own investigation and self-imposed penalties were sufficient. The NCAA Infractions Appeals Committee responded that "the cooperative efforts of the university in the academic cheating scandal involving 61 Florida State athletes failed to outweigh the aggravating factors in the case."<ref>[http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/college/seminoles/os-fsu-ncaa-appeal-bowden-01052010,0,413893.story Florida State loses NCAA appeal; Bowden to lose victories]</ref> The games to be vacated will be determined by certifying which of the 14 games any of the 25 ineligible players competed.<ref>[http://www2.tbo.com/content/2010/jan/05/051159/fsu-loses-ncaa-appeal-must-vacate-wins/ FSU loses NCAA appeal, must vacate wins]</ref>
