'''''Xeromphalina setulipes''''' is a species of [[Mycenaceae]] fungus. First collected in 2005, it was described and [[Valid name (botany)|named]] in 2010 by Fernando Esteve-Ravent<U+00F3>s and Gabriel Moreno, and is known only from [[oak]] forests in [[Ciudad Real Province]], Spain. The species produces [[mushroom]]s with dark reddish-brown [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|15|mm|in}} across, dark purplish-brown [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] up to {{convert|45|mm|in}} in height and distinctive, arched, brown [[lamellae (mycology)|gills]]. The mushrooms were found growing directly from the [[acidic soil]] of the [[forest floor]], surrounded by [[detrius|plant waste]], during November.

[[Morphology (biology)|Morphologically]], the dark colour of the gills and stem, lack of a strong taste, and characters of the [[cystidia]] (large [[cell (biology)|cells]] found on the mushrooms) are the most distinguishing characteristics of ''X.&nbsp;setulipes''.<ref name="p581"/> These features allow the species to be readily distinguished from other, similar species, including ''[[Xeromphalina cauticinalis|X.&nbsp;cauticinalis]]'' and ''[[Xeromphalina brunneola|X.&nbsp;brunneola]]''. Its ecology and habitat are also distinct, but it is unclear whether they can serve as certain identifying characteristics. Within the genus ''[[Xeromphalina]]'', ''X.&nbsp;setulipes'' is classified in the [[section (botany)|section]] ''Mutabiles'', along with several other species. It seems most closely related to ''[[Xeromphalina fraxinophila|X.&nbsp;fraxinophila]]'', ''[[Xeromphalina cornui|X.&nbsp;cornui]]'', ''[[Xeromphalina campanelloides|X.&nbsp;campanelloides]]'' and ''X.&nbsp;cauticinalis'', but, according to Esteve-Ravent<U+00F3>s and colleagues, further analysis is required to accurately judge the relationships between the species of ''Xeromphalina''.

''Xeromphalina setulipes'' was first [[species description|described]] in 2010 in an article in ''[[Mycological Progress]]'' by Fernando Esteve-Ravent<U+00F3>s and Gabriel Moreno, both of the [[University of Alcal<U+00E1>]].<ref>Esteve-Ravent<U+00F3>s ''et al''. 2010, pp. 575, 577</ref> The description was based on specimens collected during 2005 field work in [[Ciudad Real Province]], [[Spain]].<ref>Esteve-Ravent<U+00F3>s ''et al''. 2010, pp. 575, 578</ref> The [[type specimen]] was collected on 17 November, and was found {{convert|770|m|ft}} above sea level.<ref name="p578">Esteve-Ravent<U+00F3>s ''et al''. 2010, p. 578</ref> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''setulipes'' is from the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:setula|setula]]'', meaning "stiff hair", and ''[[wikt:pes|pes]]'', meaning "foot", in reference to the bristly hairs which cover the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]].<ref name="p577">Esteve-Ravent<U+00F3>s ''et al''. 2010, p. 577</ref>

Within ''Xeromphalina'', ''X.&nbsp;setulipes'' is part of the [[section (botany)|section]] ''Mutabiles'', which also contains ''[[Xeromphalina campanelloides|X.&nbsp;campanelloides]]'', ''[[Xeromphalina cauticinalis|X.&nbsp;cauticinalis]]'', ''[[Xeromphalina cirris|X.&nbsp;cirris]]'', ''[[Xeromphalina cornui|X.&nbsp;cornui]]'', ''[[Xeromphalina fraxinophila|X.&nbsp;fraxinophila]]'' and ''[[Xeromphalina parvibulbosa|X.&nbsp;parvibulbosa]]''.<ref name="p579">Esteve-Ravent<U+00F3>s ''et al''. 2010, p. 579</ref> [[phylogenetics|Phylogenetic analysis]] performed by Esteve-Ravent<U+00F3>s and colleagues concluded that ''X.&nbsp;setulipes'' appears to be most closely related to ''X.&nbsp;fraxinophila'', ''X.&nbsp;cornui'', ''X.&nbsp;campanelloides'' and ''X.&nbsp;cauticinalis'',<ref name="p581">Esteve-Ravent<U+00F3>s ''et al''. 2010, p. 581</ref> the five of which are clearly separate from the group containing ''[[Xeromphalina campanella|X.&nbsp;campanella]]'', ''[[Xeromphalina kauffmanii|X.&nbsp;kauffmanii]]'', ''[[Xeromphalina brunneola|X.&nbsp;brunneola]]'', and, possibly, ''[[Xeromphalina junipericola|X.&nbsp;junipericola]]''.<ref>Esteve-Ravent<U+00F3>s ''et al''. 2010, pp. 581<U+2013>2</ref> Data from the large subunit ([[60S]]) of the nuclear [[ribosomal RNA]] gene suggests that the species is most closely related to ''X.&nbsp;campanelloides'', while [[internal transcribed spacer]] (ITS) data place it closest to a [[clade]] containing ''X.&nbsp;cauticinalis'' and ''X.''&nbsp;[[aff.]]&nbsp;''parvibulbosa'' (an unidentified species similar, but not identical, to ''X.&nbsp;parvibulbosa'').<ref>Esteve-Ravent<U+00F3>s ''et al''. 2010, figs. 3, 4</ref> Further research, analysing the ITS or [[RPB2]] [[Locus (genetics)|loci]], could serve to help clarify the precise relationships of species and positions of clades within the genus.<ref name="p582">Esteve-Ravent<U+00F3>s ''et al''. 2010, p. 582</ref>

''Xeromphalina setulipes'' produces [[basidiocarp]]s in the form of [[mushroom]]s. Each mushroom has a flattened-convex [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of between {{convert|8|and|15|mm|in}} in diameter with a depressed centre. It is not particularly [[hygrophanous]] (it does not change color as it loses or absorbs water), and, unlike the caps of related species, is neither grooved nor translucent at the margin. The cap is dark brown, sometimes with reddish colouration. It becomes paler, turning [[tobacco]]-brown, when it dries; this change is more noticeable at the cap margin. The caps of young mushrooms are smooth and hairless, but they wrinkle as they age; however, fine, soft hairs are sometimes visible towards the margin (which is rolled inwards) when the cap is dry. The margin is typically not smooth; instead, it undulates.<ref name="p578"/>

The cylindrical stem measures between {{convert|30|and|45|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} in length by {{convert|1|and|2|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} in width, though it is slightly thicker at the very bottom. It is stiff, but can be somewhat flexible. The colour is a dark brown, sometimes approaching black, with purplish hints. It appears smooth, but is actually covered in minute tufts. The hairs at the base of the stem are somewhat more visible, and are an amber colour. The [[lamellae (mycology)|gills]] are subdistant (neither close to, nor distant from, one another) and are of a distinctive shape; they are decurrent, that is, they extend down the stem, and are noticeably arched. The gills can be up to {{convert|2|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} thick, and sometimes split into two. The gills are a tobacco-brown no matter the age of the mushroom, though the edges can be paler (sometimes whitish) and [[wiktionary:crenulate|crenulate]]. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is firm but flexible, and the same colour as the surface. It has an indistinct smell, and a taste that is not bitter.<ref name="p578"/>

===Microscopic characteristics===
''Xeromphalina setulipes'' has smooth, [[ellipsoid]] to somewhat [[cylindrical]] spores that measure from 5.0 to 7.3 [[micrometre]]s (<U+03BC>m) by 2.9 to 3.7&nbsp;<U+03BC>m. They are [[Amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], meaning that they [[staining|stain]] a dark colour in [[Melzer's reagent]] or [[Lugol's solution]], and have thin [[cell wall]]s. The four-spored (occasionally two-spored) [[basidia]] are shaped like narrow clubs, sometimes approaching cylindrical, and measure between 21 and 30&nbsp;<U+03BC>m long by 4.5 to 5.5&nbsp;<U+03BC>m wide. The [[sterigmata]], the narrow prongs that connect the spores to the basidia, can measure up to 3&nbsp;<U+03BC>m in length. The edge of the gill is primarily made up of cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge) but there are also some basidia. The [[hyaline]] (translucent) cheilocystidia have an irregular, sometimes vaguely cylindrical shape, and measure between 30 and 80&nbsp;<U+03BC>m by 3 to 7&nbsp;<U+03BC>m. They are packed together, extending outwards from the gill in a manner reminiscent of [[coral]], as is sometimes seen in members of the genus ''[[Mycena]]''.  The abundant caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) project prominently, and are visible to the naked eye as the minute hairs on the stem. They measure between 30 and 60&nbsp;<U+03BC>m by 5 to 10&nbsp;<U+03BC>m. They are swollen in the middle, tapering at each end, but are irregular in shape and are often curved. The particularly thick cell walls can be as much as 2.5&nbsp;<U+03BC>m wide. The caulocystidia are yellowish-brown. There are a large number of circumcystidia (cystidia found on the margin of the cap), which are similar to the cheilocystidia. They typically have thick cell walls, and numerous projections of various sorts grow from their sides. The circumcystidia form a mass reminiscent of coral.<ref name="p578"/>

The flesh in the gills is composed of cylindrical [[hyphae]] measuring between 4 and 8&nbsp;<U+03BC>m thick that run parallel to one another. The hyphae typically have fairly thin, smooth walls, but they can have a small amount of brown [[pigment]], which stains orange-brown in [[potassium hydroxide]]. The [[pileipellis]], the uppermost layer of hyphae in the cap, forms a [[Pileipellis#Cutis|cutis]] made up of cylindrical, slightly thicker-walled hyphae of between 5 and 10&nbsp;<U+03BC>m wide. They can be interwoven or primarily extending from the margin to the centre. The pigmentation is yellowish-brown and stains reddish-brown in potassium hydroxide. The hyphae below the pileipellis run parallel to one another and measure between 4 and 8&nbsp;<U+03BC>m in width. Their yellowish-brown pigment stains orange-brown in potassium hydroxide. The [[stipitipellis]], the uppermost layer of hyphae on the stem, also forms a cutis. The cylindrical hyphae run parallel to one another and have thick cell walls. They have a dark red-brown pigment, which stains darker still in potassium hydroxide. [[Clamp connection]]s are present.<ref name="p578"/>

===Similar species===
[[File:Xeromphalina cauticinalis 163769.jpg|thumb|right|The similar ''[[Xeromphalina cauticinalis|X.&nbsp;cauticinalis]]'']]
''Xeromphalina setulipes'' shows some similarities to ''X.&nbsp;cauticinalis''. They share the amber-coloured hair towards the base of the stem and both grow on soil, as opposed to directly onto wood. Further, ''X.&nbsp;cauticinalis'' can display caulocystidia of the same distinctive shape as those of ''X.&nbsp;setulipes'' (though these are mixed with the other shapes more typical of the genus). ''X.&nbsp;cauticinalis'' mushrooms are typically of a different colour; for instance, the area at the top of the stem is paler than the rest, compared to the entirely dark stem of ''X.&nbsp;setulipes''. Furthermore, ''X.&nbsp;cauticinalis'' has a very bitter taste.<ref>Esteve-Ravent<U+00F3>s ''et al''. 2010, pp. 579<U+2013>80</ref> ''X.&nbsp;setulipes'' shares with ''X.&nbsp;brunneola'' its dark colouration and some microscopic traits. However, the two clearly differ in the shape of both the cheilocystidia and the pileocystidia, the width of the spores (the spores of ''X.&nbsp;brunneola'' measure between 2 and 3&nbsp;<U+03BC>m in width) and the fact it is found specifically in [[softwood]] woodland. Furthermore, the two do not appear to be closely related.<ref name="p580">Esteve-Ravent<U+00F3>s ''et al''. 2010, p. 580</ref>

Other species within ''Mutabiles'' include ''X.&nbsp;campanelloides'', which can be differentiated by the shape of the thin-walled caulocystidia and yellow flesh in the stem. ''X.&nbsp;cornui'' grows in softwood forests with ''[[Sphagnum]]'' moss. Both the cap and the top of stem sport yellow grains. ''X.&nbsp;fraxinophila'' produces larger mushrooms and has yellow gills. ''X.&nbsp;parvibulbosa'', while potentially featuring similar caulocystidia to ''X.&nbsp;setulipes'', has a bitter or sour taste.<ref name="p580"/>

==Habitat, distribution and ecology==
''Xeromphalina setulipes'' is only known from the [[type location (biology)|type locality]] in the [[province of Ciudad Real]], Spain.<ref name="p578"/> Members of the [[Mycenaceae]] are [[saprotrophic]],<ref>Cannon and Kirk 2007, pp. 225<U+2013>6</ref> and ''X.&nbsp;setulipes'' was found in woodland made up of [[Quercus suber|cork oak]] (''Quercus suber'') and [[Quercus faginea|Portuguese oak]] (''Quercus faginea''), with undergrowth consisting of [[gum rockrose]] (''Cistus ladanifer''), [[Juniperus oxycedrus|prickly juniper]] (''Juniperus oxycedrus''), and various [[Erica|heathers]] (''Erica'' species).<ref name="p578"/> The mushrooms were growing in clusters on the [[forest floor]] from [[acid soil]], surrounded by dead plant matter.<ref name="p578"/> The species's ecological patterns may be useful identifying characteristics, distinct from other, similar species.<ref name="p581"/> The mushrooms were found in autumn, and collected in November.<ref>Esteve-Ravent<U+00F3>s ''et al.'' 2010, pp. 575, 578</ref>
