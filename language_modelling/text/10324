'''Pluto''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: [[British English|BrE]] {{IPA|/<U+02C8>plu<U+02D0>t<U+0259><U+028A>/}}, [[American English|AmE]] {{IPA|/<U+02C8>pluto<U+028A>/}}), also designated '''134340 Pluto''' (see ''[[minor planet names]]''), is the second-largest known [[dwarf planet]] in the [[Solar System]] and the tenth-largest body observed directly orbiting the Sun. Originally considered a planet, Pluto has since  been recognised as the largest member of a distinct region called the [[Kuiper belt]]. Like other members of the belt, it is primarily composed of rock and ice and is relatively small; approximately a fifth the mass of the [[Earth]]'s [[Moon]] and a third its volume. Pluto is [[List of solar system objects by mass|smaller than seven moons in the Solar System]]. It has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric orbit]] that takes it from 29 to 49 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] (4.3<U+2013>7.3 billion km) from the [[Sun]], and is highly inclined with respect to the planets. As a result, Pluto occasionally comes closer to the Sun than the planet [[Neptune]].

Pluto and its largest satellite, [[Charon (moon)|Charon]], are often considered a [[Binary system (astronomy)|binary system]] because they are closer in size than any other known celestial pair in the Solar System, and because the [[Center of mass#Barycenter|barycentre]] of their orbits does not lie within either body.<ref>

From the time of its discovery in 1930 until 2006, Pluto was considered the Solar System's ninth planet. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries however, many objects similar to Pluto were discovered in the outer solar system, most notably the [[scattered disc object]] [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], which is slightly larger than Pluto. On [[August 24]], [[2006]] the IAU [[2006 definition of planet|defined the term "planet"]] for the first time. This definition excluded Pluto from planethood, and reclassified it under the new category of [[dwarf planet]] along with Eris and [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]].<ref> {{cite web

==Discovery==
[[Image:Pluto discovery plates.png|thumb|left|Discovery photographs of Pluto]]
In&nbsp;1930&nbsp;[[Clyde Tombaugh|Clyde&nbsp;Tombaugh]] was searching for a ninth planet as part of a project at [[Lowell Observatory]]. His task was to systematically image the night sky in pairs of photographs taken two weeks apart, then examine each pair and determine if any objects had shifted position in that time. Using a machine called a [[blink comparator]], he rapidly shifted each plate back and forth to create the illusion of movement. On [[February 18]], [[1930]], Tombaugh discovered a possible moving object on photographic plates taken on [[January 23]] and [[January 29]] of that year. A lesser-quality photograph taken on [[January 20]] helped confirm the movement. After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the [[Harvard College Observatory]] on [[March 13]], [[1930]]. Pluto would later be found on photographs dating back to [[March 19]], [[1915]].<ref name="Hoyt">{{cite journal

===Incorrect prediction===
The history of how Pluto was discovered is intertwined with the discoveries of [[Neptune]] and [[Uranus]]. In the 1840s, using [[Newtonian mechanics]], both [[Urbain Le Verrier]] and [[John Couch Adams]] had correctly predicted the position of the then-undiscovered planet Neptune after analysing perturbations in the orbit of Uranus. Hypothesising that the perturbations were caused by the gravitational pull of another planet, Le Verrier sent his calculations to German astronomer [[Johann Gottfried Galle]]. On [[September 23]], [[1846]], the night following his receipt of the letter, Galle and his student [[Heinrich d'Arrest]] found [[Neptune]] precisely where Le Verrier had predicted.<ref>{{cite book

Observations of Neptune in the late 19th century caused astronomers to speculate that Uranus's orbit was being disturbed by another planet in addition to Neptune. In 1905, Lowell Observatory (founded by [[Percival Lowell]] in 1894) started an extensive project in search of a possible ninth planet, which Lowell termed "[[Planet X]]".<ref name="pluto guide">{{cite web

}}</ref> By 1909, Lowell and [[William Henry Pickering|William H. Pickering]] had suggested several possible celestial coordinates for such a planet.<ref name="Hoyt"/> The work continued after Lowell's death in 1916. 

Once found, Pluto's faintness and lack of a visible disc cast doubt on the idea that it could be Lowell's Planet X. Today, astronomers know that no one had actually predicted Pluto's existence, as it is far too small to have the effect on Uranus's orbit that initiated the search. After the flyby of Neptune by [[Voyager 2]] in 1989, it was conclusively demonstrated that the discrepancies in Uranus's orbit observed by 19th-century astronomers were due instead to inaccurate estimates of Neptune's mass. Lowell had made a prediction of Planet X's position in 1915 which was fairly close to Pluto's actual position at that time; however, [[Ernest W. Brown]] concluded almost immediately that this was a coincidence, a view still held today, which makes Tombaugh's discovery even more surprising.<ref>{{cite web

The best images of Pluto derive from brightness maps created from close observations of eclipses by its largest moon, Charon. Using computer processing, observations are made in brightness factors as Pluto is eclipsed by Charon. For example, eclipsing a bright spot on Pluto makes a bigger total brightness change than eclipsing a gray spot. Using this technique, one can measure the total average brightness of the Pluto-Charon system and track changes in brightness over time.<ref>{{cite journal

The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] places Pluto's density at between 1.8 and 2.1 g/cm<U+00B3>, suggesting its internal composition consists of roughly 50<U+2013>70 percent rock and 30<U+2013>50 percent ice.<ref name=Solstation /> Because decay of radioactive minerals would eventually heat the ices enough for them to separate from rock, scientists expect that Pluto's internal structure is differentiated, with the rocky material having settled into a dense [[Core (geology)|core]] surrounded by a [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] of ice. It is also possible that such heating may continue into the present time, creating a subsurface ocean of liquid water.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Inside Story|work=New Horizons|url=http://www.pluto.jhuapl.edu/science/everything_pluto/9_insideStory.html|year=2007|accessdate=2007-03-29}}</ref>

Astronomers, assuming Pluto to be Lowell's Planet X, initially calculated its mass on the basis of its presumed effect on Neptune and Uranus. In 1955, Pluto was calculated to be roughly the mass of the Earth, with further calculations in 1971 bringing the mass down to roughly that of Mars.<ref name="Croswellp57">Croswell p. 57</ref> However, in 1976, David Cuikshank, Carl Pilcher and David Morrison of the [[University of Hawaii]] calculated Pluto's [[Albedo#Astronomical albedo|albedo]] for the first time, and found it matched that for [[methane]] ice, which meant Pluto had to be exceptionally bright, and therefore could not be more than 1 percent the mass of the Earth.<ref name="Croswellp57"/><ref>Pluto's albedo is 1.3<U+2013>2.0 times greater than that of Earth. {{cite web

Among the objects of the Solar System, Pluto is not only smaller and much less massive than any planet, but at less than 0.2 lunar masses it is also smaller than seven of the [[natural satellite|moon]]s: [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], [[Io (moon)|Io]], the [[Moon]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Triton (moon)|Triton]]. Pluto is more than twice the diameter and a dozen times the mass of [[1 Ceres|Ceres]], a [[dwarf planet]] in the [[asteroid belt]]. However, it is smaller than the dwarf planet [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], a [[trans-Neptunian object]] discovered in 2005.

=== Atmosphere ===
[[Image:New horizons Pluto.jpg|thumb|Arist's conception of the [[New Horizons]] spacecraft passing over Pluto, showing its tenuous atmosphere]]
Pluto's atmosphere consists of a thin envelope of [[nitrogen]], [[methane]], and [[carbon monoxide]], derived from the ices on its surface.<ref>{{cite web|title= Nitrogen in Pluto's Atmosphere|author= Ken Croswell|url=http://www.kencroswell.com/NitrogenInPlutosAtmosphere.html|year=1992|accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref> As Pluto moves away from the Sun,  its [[atmosphere]] gradually freezes and falls to the ground. As it edges closer to the Sun, the temperature of Pluto's solid surface increases, causing the ices to [[Sublimation (physics)|sublimate]] into gas. This creates an [[Anti-Greenhouse Effect|anti-greenhouse effect]]; much like [[sweat]] cools the body as it evaporates from the surface of the [[skin]], this sublimation has a cooling effect on the surface of Pluto.

Pluto was found to have an atmosphere from an [[occultation]] observation in 1985; the finding was confirmed and significantly strengthened by extensive observations of another occultation in 1988. When an object with no atmosphere occults a star, the star abruptly disappears; in the case of Pluto, the star dimmed out gradually.<ref>{{cite web

== Orbit ==
[[Image:TheKuiperBelt Orbits Pluto Ecliptic.svg|right|thumb|Orbit of Pluto <U+2013> ecliptic view. This 'side view' of Pluto's orbit (in red) shows its large [[orbital inclination|inclination]] to Neptune's orbit (in blue). The [[ecliptic]] is horizontal]]
Pluto's orbit is markedly different to those of the planets. The planets all orbit the Sun close to a flat reference [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] called the [[ecliptic]], and have nearly circular orbits. In contrast, Pluto's orbit is highly [[orbital inclination|inclined]] relative to the ecliptic (over 17<U+00B0>) and highly [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] ([[elliptical]]). This high eccentricity leads to a small region of Pluto's orbit lying closer to the Sun than [[Neptune]]'s. Pluto was last interior to Neptune's orbit between [[February 7]], [[1979]] and [[February 11]], [[1999]]. Detailed calculations indicate that the previous such occurrence lasted only fourteen years from [[July 11]], [[1735]] to [[September 15]], [[1749]], whereas between [[April 30]], [[1483]] and [[July 23]], [[1503]], it had again lasted for 20 years.

Although this repeating pattern may suggest a regular structure, in the long term Pluto's orbit is in fact [[Chaos theory|chaotic]]. While computer simulations can be used to predict its position for several million years (both [[Time reversibility|forwards and backwards]] in time), after intervals longer than [[Lyapunov time|10<U+2013>20 million years]], it is impossible to determine exactly where Pluto will be because its position becomes too sensitive to unmeasurable details of the present state of the solar system.<ref name="sussman88">{{cite journal

}}</ref> For example, at some specific time many millions of years from now, Pluto may be at aphelion or perihelion (or anywhere inbetween), with no way for us to predict which. This does not mean that the orbit of Pluto itself is unstable, however; only that its position along that orbit is impossible to determine far into the future. In fact, several resonances and other dynamical effects conspire to keep Pluto's orbit stable, safe from planetary collision or scattering. 

=== Neptune-avoiding orbit ===
[[Image:TheKuiperBelt Orbits Pluto Polar.svg|thumb|left|Orbit of Pluto &mdash; polar view. This 'view from above' shows how Pluto's orbit (in red) is less circular than Neptune's (in blue), and how Pluto is sometimes closer to the Sun than Neptune. The darker halves of both orbits show where they pass below the [[plane of the ecliptic]]. The positions of both bodies are on [[April 16]], [[2006]]; by April 2007 they will have changed by about three pixels (~1 AU).]] 

Despite Pluto's orbit apparently crossing that of Neptune when viewed from directly above the [[ecliptic]], the two objects cannot collide. This is because their orbits are aligned so that Pluto and Neptune can never approach closely. Several factors contribute to this.

At the simplest level, one can examine the two orbits and see that they do not intersect. When Pluto is closest to the Sun, and hence closest to Neptune's orbit as viewed in a top-down projection (right), it is also the farthest above the ecliptic. This means Pluto's orbit actually passes ''above'' that of Neptune, preventing a collision.<ref name=huainn01>{{cite journal

However, this alone is not enough to protect Pluto; [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] from the planets, particularly Neptune, would adjust Pluto's orbit (e.g. [[Precession#Precession of planetary orbits|orbital precession]]), so that over millions of years a collision could be possible. Some other effect(s) must therefore be in place. The most significant of these is a [[orbital resonance|mean motion resonance]] with Neptune.
[[Image:TheKuiperBelt Orbits Pluto Neptune2.svg|thumb|This diagram shows the relative positions of Pluto (red) and Neptune (blue) on selected dates. The size of Neptune and Pluto is depicted as inversely proportional to the distance between them to emphasize the closest approach in 1896.]]

Pluto lies in the 3:2 mean motion resonance of [[Neptune (planet)|Neptune]]: for every three orbits of Neptune around the Sun, Pluto makes two. The two objects then return to their initial positions and the cycle repeats, each cycle lasting about 500 years. This pattern is configured so that, in each 500-year cycle, the first time that Pluto is near [[perihelion]] Neptune is over 50<U+00B0> "behind" Pluto. By Pluto's second perihelion, Neptune will have completed a further one and a half of its own orbits, and so will be a similar distance "ahead" of Pluto. In fact, the minimum separation of Pluto and Neptune is over 17 AU; Pluto actually comes closer (11 AU) to [[Uranus]] than it does to Neptune.<ref name=malhotra-9planets /> 

The 3:2 resonance between the two bodies is highly stable, and is preserved  over millions of years.<ref name=sp-345>{{cite web|author=Hannes Alfv<U+00E9>n and Gustaf Arrhenius|url=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-345/ch8.htm||title= SP-345 Evolution of the Solar System|year=1976|accessdate=2007-03-28}}</ref> This prevents their orbits from changing relative to one another &mdash; the cycle always repeats in the same way &mdash; and so the two bodies can never pass near to each other. Thus, even if Pluto's orbit were not highly inclined, the two bodies could never collide.<ref name=malhotra-9planets />

=== Other factors governing Pluto's orbit ===
[[Image:Orbit.svg|thumb|left|diagram of the argument of perihelion]]
Numerical studies have shown that over periods of millions of years, the general nature of the alignment between Pluto's and Neptune's orbits does not change.<ref name=huainn01/><ref name="williams71">{{cite journal| title=Resonances in the Neptune-Pluto System| author= J. G. Williams;  G. S. Benson| journal=Astronomical Journal| volume=76| pages=167| year=1971| url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1971AJ.....76..167W | accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref> However, there are several other resonances and interactions which govern the details of their relative motion, and enhance Pluto's stability. These arise principally from two additional mechanisms (in addition to the 3:2 mean motion resonance).

First, Pluto's [[argument of perihelion]], the angle between the point where it crosses the ecliptic and the point where it is closest to the Sun, [[libration|librates]] around 90<U+00B0>.<ref name="williams71"/> This means that when Pluto is nearest the Sun, it is at its farthest above the plane of the solar system, preventing encounters with Neptune. This is a direct consequence of the [[Kozai mechanism]],<ref name=huainn01/> which relates the eccentricity of a orbit to its inclination, relative to a larger perturbing body &mdash; in this case Neptune. Relative to Neptune, the amplitude of libration is 38<U+00B0>, and so the angular separation of Pluto's perihelion to the orbit of Neptune is always greater than 52<U+00B0> (= 90<U+00B0><U+2013>38<U+00B0>). The closest such angular separation occurs every 10,000 years.<ref name=sp-345/>

Second, the longitudes of ascending node of the two bodies - the points where they cross the ecliptic - are in near-resonance with the above libration. When the two longitudes are the same &mdash;that is, when one could draw a straight line through both nodes and the Sun &mdash;Pluto's perihelion lies exactly at 90<U+00B0>, and it comes closest to the Sun at its peak above Neptune's orbit. In other words, when Pluto most closely intersects the plane of Neptune's orbit, it must be at its farthest beyond it. This is known as the ''1:1 superresonance''.<ref name=huainn01/>

To understand the nature of the libration, imagine a polar point of view, looking down on the ecliptic from a distant vantage point where the planets orbit [[counter-clockwise]]. After passing the ascending node, Pluto is interior to Neptune's orbit and moving faster, approaching Neptune from behind. The strong gravitational pull between the two causes [[angular momentum]] to be transferred to Pluto, at Neptune's expense. This moves Pluto into a slightly larger orbit, where it travels slightly slower, in accordance with [[Kepler's third law]]. As its orbit changes, this has the gradual effect of changing the pericentre and longitudes of Pluto (and, to a lesser degree, of Neptune). After many such repetitions, Pluto is sufficiently slowed, and Neptune sufficiently speeded up, that Neptune begins to catch Pluto at the opposite side of its orbit (near the opposing node to where we began). The process is then reversed, and Pluto loses angular momentum to Neptune, until Pluto is sufficiently speeded up that it begins to catch Neptune once again at the original node. The whole process takes about 20,000 years to complete.<ref name=malhotra-9planets /><ref name=sp-345 />

[[Image:Pluto system 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Pluto and its three known moons. Pluto and Charon are the bright objects in the center, the two smaller moons are at the right and bottom, farther out.]]

The Plutonian moons are unusually close to Pluto, compared to other observed systems.

For example, [[Psamathe (moon)|Psamathe]] orbits Neptune at 40% of the Hill radius. In the case of Pluto, only the inner 3% of the zone is known to be occupied by satellites.

[[Image:Pluto system.svg|thumb|left|Diagram of the Plutonian system. P 1 is Hydra, and P 2 is Nix.]]
Two additional moons of Pluto were imaged by astronomers working with the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] on [[May 15]] [[2005]], and received [[Provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designations]] of S/2005&nbsp;P&nbsp;1 and S/2005&nbsp;P&nbsp;2. The International Astronomical Union officially named Pluto's newest moons [[Nix (moon)|Nix]] (or Pluto&nbsp;II, the inner of the two moons, formerly P&nbsp;2) and [[Hydra (moon)|Hydra]] (Pluto&nbsp;III, the outer moon, formerly P&nbsp;1), on [[June 21]], [[2006]].<ref>{{cite press release | publisher=International Astronomical Union | date=2006-06-21 | title=IAU Circular No. 8723 - Satellites of Pluto | url=http://www-int.stsci.edu/~mutchler/documents/IAU_Circular_8723.pdf | accessdate=2007-02-12}}</ref>

These small moons orbit Pluto at approximately two and three times the distance of Charon: Nix at 48,700 kilometres and Hydra at 64,800 kilometres from the barycenter of the system. They have nearly circular [[prograde and retrograde motion|prograde]] orbits in the same orbital plane as Charon, and are very close to (but not in) 4:1 and 6:1 mean motion [[orbital resonance]]s with Charon.<ref>{{cite journal | author= F.

Observations of Nix and Hydra to determine individual characteristics are ongoing. Hydra is sometimes brighter than Nix, suggesting either that it is larger or that different parts of its surface may vary in brightness. Sizes are estimated from albedos. The moons' spectral similarity with Charon suggests a 35% albedo similar to Charon's; this results in diameter estimates of 46 kilometres for Nix and 61 kilometres for brighter Hydra. Upper limits on their diameters can be estimated by assuming the 4% albedo of the darkest Kuiper Belt objects; these bounds are 137&nbsp;<U+00B1>&nbsp;11&nbsp;km and 167&nbsp;<U+00B1>&nbsp;10&nbsp;km respectively. At the larger end of this range, the inferred masses are less than 0.3% that of Charon, or 0.03% of Pluto's.<ref name="Weaver 2006">

The discovery of the two small moons suggests that Pluto may possess a variable [[ring system]]. Small body impacts can create debris that can form into planetary rings. Data from a deep optical survey by the [[Advanced Camera for Surveys]] on the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] suggests that no ring system is present. If such a system exists, it is either tenuous like the [[Rings of Jupiter]], or it is tightly confined to less than 1000km in width.<ref name="Steffl 2006">{{cite journal

In imaging the Plutonian system, observations from Hubble placed limits on any additional moons. With 90% confidence, no additional moons larger than 12 km (or a maximum of 37 km with an albedo of 0.041) exist beyond the glare of Pluto 5 arcseconds from the dwarf planet. This assumes a Charon-like albedo of 0.38; at a 50% confidence level the limit is 8 kilometers.<ref name="Steffl2005>{{cite journal

==Kuiper belt==
{{main|Kuiper belt}}
[[Image:Mainkuiperbelt.jpg|thumb|Artist's conception of the Kuiper belt, with Pluto's orbit (yellow) contrasted with Neptune's (white)]]
Pluto's origin and identity have long puzzled astronomers. In the 1950s it was suggested that Pluto was an escaped moon of Neptune, knocked out of orbit by its largest current moon, [[Triton (moon)|Triton]]. This notion has been heavily criticised since, as explained above, Pluto never actually comes near the planet in its orbit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pluto's Orbit|work=NASA New Horizons|url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/science/everything_pluto/16_plutoOrbit.html|year=2007|accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref>  

Beginning in 1992, astronomers began to discover a large population of small icy objects beyond Neptune that were similar to Pluto not only in orbit but also in size and composition. This belt, known as the [[Kuiper belt]] after [[Gerard Kuiper|one of the astronomers]] who first hypothesised its existence, is believed to be the source for all [[short-period comet]]s. Astronomers now believe Pluto to be the largest of the [[Kuiper belt object]]s. Pluto, like other Kuiper Belt objects, shares features in common with [[comets]]; the [[solar wind]] is gradually blowing Pluto's surface into space, in the manner of a comet.<ref> {{cite web| title= Colossal Cousin to a Comet?| work=New Horizons| url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/science/everything_pluto/8_cousin.html| accessdate=2006-06-23}} </ref> If Pluto were placed near the Sun, it would develop a tail, like comets do.<ref> {{cite web |year= 1999| author= Neil deGrasse Tyson | title=

<div style="clear: both"></div> 

Though Pluto is the largest of the Kuiper belt objects discovered so far,  Triton, which is slightly larger than Pluto, shares many atmospherical and geological composition similarities with Pluto and is believed to be a captured Kuiper belt object.<ref>{{cite web|title=Neptune's Moon Triton|work=The Planetary Society|url=http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/neptune/triton.html|accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref> Eris ([[#New discoveries ignite debate|see below]]) is also larger than Pluto but is not strictly considered a member of the Kuiper belt population. Rather, it is considered a member of a linked population called the [[scattered disc]].  

A large number of Kuiper belt objects, like Pluto, possess a 3:2 orbital resonance with Neptune. KBOs with this orbital resonance are called "[[plutino]]s", after Pluto.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Plutinos|author=David Jewitt|work=University of Hawaii|url=http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~jewitt/kb/plutino.html|year=2004|accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref>

== Exploration of Pluto ==
{{main|New Horizons}}
[[Image:New Horizons Jan19 06.jpg|thumb|right|''[[New Horizons]]'', launched on [[January 19]], [[2006]]]]
Pluto presents significant challenges for spacecraft because of its small mass and great distance from Earth. ''[[Voyager 1]]'' could have visited Pluto, but controllers opted instead for a close flyby of [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn's]] moon Titan, which resulted in a trajectory incompatible with a Pluto flyby. [[Voyager 2]] never had a plausible trajectory for reaching Pluto.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/faq.html| title=Voyager Frequently Asked Questions| accessdate=2006-09-08| publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory| date=January 14, 2003}}</ref> No serious attempt to explore Pluto via spacecraft occurred until the last decade of the 20th century. In August, 1992, [[JPL]] scientist [[Robert Staehle]] telephoned Pluto's discoverer, Clyde Tombaugh, requesting permission to visit his planet. "I told him he was welcome to it," Tombaugh later remembered, "though he's got to go one long, cold trip."<ref>{{cite web|title=The last world|author=Dava Sobel|work=Discover magazine|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1511/is_n5_v14/ai_13794133|year=1993|accessdate=2007-04-13}}</ref>  Despite this early momentum, in 2000, NASA cancelled the ''[[Pluto Kuiper Express]]'' mission, citing increasing costs and launch vehicle delays.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pluto Kuiper Express|author=Dr. David R. Williams |work=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/database/MasterCatalog?sc=PLUTOKE|year=2005|accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref> 

After an intense political battle, a revised mission to Pluto, dubbed ''[[New Horizons]]'', was granted funding from the US government in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pluto Mission a Go! Initial Funding Secured|author=Robert Roy Britt|work=space.com|url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/pluto_horizons_030225.html|year=2003|accessdate=2007-04-13}}</ref> ''New Horizons'' was launched successfully on [[January 19]], [[2006]]. The mission leader, [[S. Alan Stern]], confirmed that some of the ashes of Clyde Tombaugh, who died in 1997, had been placed aboard the spacecraft.<ref>{{cite web|title=Happy 100th Birthday, Clyde Tombaugh|author=Dr. Alan Stern|work=Southwest Research Institute|url=http://www.jhuapl.edu/newscenter/pressreleases/2006/060203.asp|year=2006|accessdate=2007-04-13}}</ref>

In early 2007 the craft made use of a [[gravity assist]] from [[Jupiter]], and its closest approach to Pluto will be on [[July 14]], [[2015]]. Scientific observations of Pluto will begin 5 months prior to closest approach and will continue for at least a month after the encounter. ''New Horizons'' captured its first images of Pluto in late September 2006, during a test of the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/news_center/news/112806.htm | title=New Horizons, Not Quite to Jupiter, Makes First Pluto Sighting | publisher=The John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory | date=[[2006-11-28]] | accessdate=2007-03-20}}</ref> The images, taken from a distance of approximately 4.2 billion kilometres (2.6 billion miles), confirm the spacecraft's ability to track distant targets, critical for maneuvering toward Pluto and other Kuiper Belt objects.
[[Image:112806 pluto animation.gif|thumb|left|First Pluto sighting from ''New Horizons'']]
''New Horizons'' will use a remote sensing package that includes imaging instruments and a radio science investigation tool, as well as spectroscopic and other experiments, to characterise the global geology and morphology of Pluto and its moon Charon, map their surface composition and analyse Pluto's neutral atmosphere and its escape rate. ''New Horizons'' will also photograph the surfaces of Pluto and Charon.

Discovery of moons Nix and Hydra may present unforeseen challenges for the probe. With the relatively low escape velocity of Nix and Hydra, collisions with Kuiper belt debris may produce a tenuous dusty ring. Were New Horizons to fly through such a ring system, there would be an increased potential for micrometeorite damage that could potentially disable the probe.<ref name="Steffl 2006">{{cite journal| first=Andrew J.| last=Steffl| coauthors=S.

==Planetary status controversy==
{{seealso|Definition of planet}}
Pluto's official status as a planet has been a subject of controversy since at least 1992, when the first [[Kuiper Belt Object]], {{mpl|(15760) 1992 QB|1}}, was discovered. Since then, further discoveries intensified the debate in the 21st century.

===Commemoration as a planet===
Pluto is shown as a planet on the [[Pioneer plaque]], an inscription on the space probes ''[[Pioneer 10]]'' and ''[[Pioneer 11]]'', launched in the early 1970s. The plaque, intended to give information about the origin of the probes to any alien civilization that might in the future encounter the vehicles, includes a diagram of our solar system, showing nine planets.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spacecraft Artifacts as Physics Teaching Resources|author=R.W.

The discovery of the [[Kuiper belt]] and Pluto's relation to it led many to question whether Pluto could be considered separately from others in its population. In 2002, the KBO  [[50000 Quaoar]] was discovered, with a diameter of roughly 1,280 kilometres, about half that of Pluto.<ref>{{cite web|title=Direct Measurement of the Size of the Large Kuiper Belt Object (50000) Quaoar|author=Michael E.

On [[July 29]], [[2005]], the discovery of a [[Trans-Neptunian object]] later named [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] was announced, which is now known to be slightly larger than Pluto.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hubble Finds 'Tenth Planet' Slightly Larger Than Pluto|work=Hubblesite|url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2006/16/|year=2006|accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref> This was the largest object discovered in the solar system since [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] in 1846.

Museum and planetarium directors occasionally created controversy by omitting Pluto from planetary models of the solar system. Some omissions were intentional; the [[Hayden Planetarium]] reopened after renovation in 2000 with a model of 8 planets without Pluto. The controversy made headlines in the media at the time.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/solarsystem/tyson_responds_010202.html| title=Astronomer Responds to Pluto-Not-a-Planet Claim| date=2 February 2001| publisher=Space.com| Niel deGrasse Tyson| accessdate=2006-09-08}}</ref>

=== IAU Decision ===
{{main|2006 redefinition of planet}}

The debate came to a head in 2006 with an [[2006 redefinition of planet|IAU resolution]] that created an official definition for the term "planet". According to this resolution, there are three main conditions for an object to be considered a 'planet':
#The object must be in orbit around the [[Sun]]. 
#The object must be massive enough to be a sphere by its own gravitational force. More specifically, its own gravity should pull it into a shape of [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. 
#It must have [[Clearing the neighbourhood|cleared the neighbourhood]] around its orbit.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.iau.org/Resolutions_5-6.398.0.html|title=IAU 2006 General Assembly: Resolutions 5 and 6|publisher=IAU|date=24 August 2006|publisher=IAU}}</ref> 

Pluto fails to meet the third condition.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.iau2006.org/mirror/www.iau.org/iau0603/index.html|title=IAU 2006 General Assembly: Result of the IAU Resolution votes|publisher=IAU|date=24 August 2006|publisher=IAU}}</ref> The IAU further resolved that Pluto be classified in the simultaneously created [[dwarf planet]] category, and that it act as prototype for a yet-to-be-named category of [[trans-Neptunian object]]s, in which it would be separately, but concurrently, classified.

Among the general public, reception is mixed amidst widespread media coverage.
