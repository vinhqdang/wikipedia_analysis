'''The KLF''' (also known as '''The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu''', '''The Timelords''' and other names) were one of the seminal bands of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[acid house]] movement during the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Beginning in 1987, [[Bill Drummond]] (alias King Boy D) and [[Jimmy Cauty]] (alias Rockman Rock) released [[hip hop music|hip hop]]-inspired and [[sampling (music)|sample-heavy]] records as The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu and, on one occasion (the British number one hit single "[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]"), as The Timelords. As The KLF, Drummond and Cauty pioneered the genres "stadium house" (rave music with a pop-rock production and sampled crowd noise) and "[[ambient house]]". The KLF released a series of international top-ten hits on their own [[KLF Communications]] record label, and became the highest internationally selling UK band of 1991.  The duo also published a book, ''[[The Manual]]'', and worked on a road movie called ''[[The White Room (film)|The White Room]]''.

From the outset, they adopted the philosophy espoused by esoteric novels ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'', gaining notoriety for various anarchic [[situationist]] manifestations, including the defacement of billboard adverts, the posting of prominent cryptic advertisements in ''[[NME]]'' magazine and the mainstream press, and highly distinctive and unusual performances on [[Top of the Pops]].  Their most notorious performance was at the February 1992 [[Brit Awards]], where they fired machine gun blanks into the audience and dumped a dead sheep at the aftershow party.  This performance announced The KLF's departure from the music business, and in May 1992 the duo deleted their entire back catalogue.

With The KLF's profits, Drummond and Cauty established the [[K Foundation]] and sought to subvert the art world, staging an [[K Foundation art award|alternative art award]] for the worst artist of the year and burning a million [[pounds sterling]].  Although Drummond and Cauty remained true to their word of May 1992<U+2014>the KLF Communications catalogue remains deleted<U+2014>they have released a small number of new tracks since then, as the K Foundation, The One World Orchestra and most recently, in 1997, as 2K.

==History==

[[Bill Drummond]] was an established figure within the British [[music industry]], having co-founded [[Zoo Records]], played guitar in the Liverpool band [[Big in Japan]], and worked as manager of [[Echo and the Bunnymen]] and [[The Teardrop Explodes]]. In 1986, he resigned from his position as an [[A&R]] man at record label [[Warner Music Group|WEA]], citing that he was nearly 33.3 years old (33.3 [[revolutions per minute]] being significant to Drummond as the speed at which a [[Gramophone record|vinyl LP]] revolves), and that it was "time for a revolution in my life. There is a mountain to climb the hard way, and I want to see the world from the top".<ref name="specialk">"Special K", ''[[GQ]]'' magazine (April 1995), quoting "a ringingly quixotic press release" issued by Drummond in 1986 ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=397 link]).</ref> He released a well-received solo LP, ''[[The Man (album)|The Man]]'', judged by reviewers as "tastefully understated,"<ref name="Trouserpress">Robbins, I., "KLF", ''[[Trouser Press]]'' magazine ([http://trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=klf link]).

Artist and musician [[Jimmy Cauty]] was, in 1986, the guitarist in the commercially unsuccessful three-piece band [[Brilliant (band)|Brilliant]]<U+2014>an act that Drummond had signed to WEA Records and managed. Cauty and Drummond shared an interest in the [[esoteric]] [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] novels ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'', and, in particular, their theme of [[Discordianism]], a form of post-modern anarchism. As an art student in Liverpool, Drummond had been involved with the set design for the first stage production of ''The Illuminatus! Trilogy'', a 12-hour performance which opened in Liverpool on [[November 23]], [[1976]].<ref>The production was staged by [[Ken Campbell (actor)|Ken Campbell]]'s "Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool". [[Ian Broudie]] recalled meeting Drummond during the period of time that the play was staged, in a January 1997 interview with ''[[Mixmag]]'' ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=433]). Drummond mentioned Campbell and the play in an interview by Ben Watkins, published by ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'' Magazine in March 1997 ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=435]). Campbell spoke about his production in an interview given to James Nye, first published in ''Gneurosis'' 1991, available at [http://www.frogboy.freeuk.com/ken.html Frogweb: Ken Campbell] (URL accessed [[2 March]] [[2006]]).</ref><ref>Logan, B., "Arts: Gastromancy and other animals: Ken Campbell has a new show at the National Theatre - but he'd rather tell Brian Logan about dogs that talk and sucking spirits up your bottom", ''[[The Guardian]]'' ([[Manchester]]), [[29 August]] [[2000]], "Guardian Features Pages" section, p14.</ref>

Re-reading ''Illuminatus!'' in late 1986, and influenced by hip-hop, Drummond felt inspired to react against what he perceived to be the stagnant soundscape of popular music. Recalling the moment in a radio interview, Drummond said that the plan came to him in an instant. He would form a hip-hop band with former colleague Jimmy Cauty, and they would be called The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu.{{cquote|It was New Year's Day ... 1987. I was at home with my parents, I was going for a walk in the morning, it was, like, bright blue sky, and I thought "I'm going to make a hip-hop record. Who can I make a hip-hop record with?". I wasn't brave enough to go and do it myself, 'cause, although I can play the guitar, and I can knock out a few things on the piano, I knew nothing, personally, about the technology. And, I thought, I knew [Jimmy], I knew he was a like spirit, we share similar tastes and backgrounds in music and things. So I phoned him up that day and said "Let's form a band called The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu". And he knew exactly, to coin a phrase, "where I was coming from". And within a week we had recorded our first single which was called "All You Need Is Love".<ref>[[BBC Radio 1]] "Story Of Pop" documentary interview with Bill Drummond. First BBC broadcast believed to have been in [http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/series/STORY+OF+POP late 1994], and was transmitted by Australian national broadcaster [[ABC Radio|ABC]] on [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/pop/default.htm [[January 1]] [[2005]]].

===The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu===
[[Image:The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu- All You Need Is Love.jpg|thumb|left|The sleeve of "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs)|All You Need Is Love]]", depicting a billboard with "Shag Shag Shag" graffiti.]]
Early in 1987, Drummond and Cauty's collaborations began. They assumed alter egos - King Boy D and Rockman Rock respectively - and they adopted the name The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (The JAMs), after the fictional conspiratorial group "The Justified Ancients of Mummu" from ''The Illuminatus! Trilogy''. In those novels, the JAMs are opposed to the Illuminati, a political organisation which seeks to impose order and control upon society. As The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, Drummond and Cauty chose to interpret the principles of the fictional JAMs in the context of music production in the real world. Shrouded in the mystique provided by their disguised identities and the cultish ''Illuminatus!'', they mirrored the fictional JAMs' gleeful political tactics of causing chaos and confusion by bringing a direct, humorous but nevertheless revolutionary approach to making records, often attracting attention in unconventional ways. The JAMs' primary instrument was the [[Sampler (musical instrument)|digital sampler]] with which they would plagiarise the history of popular music, cutting chunks from existing works and pasting them into new contexts, underpinned by rudimentary [[beatbox]] rhythms and overlayed with Drummond's [[rapping|raps]], of social commentary, esoteric metaphors and mockery.

The JAMs' debut single "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs)|All You Need Is Love]]" ({{audio| The JAMs - All You Need Is Love (excerpt).ogg|sample}})dealt with the media coverage given to [[AIDS]], sampling heavily from [[The Beatles|The Beatles']] "[[All You Need Is Love]]" and [[Samantha Fox|Samantha Fox's]] "[[Touch Me (I Want Your Body)]]". Although it was declined by distributors fearful of prosecution, and threatened with lawsuits, copies of the one-sided [[white label]] 12" were sent to the [[music journalism|music press]], receiving positive reviews and being made "single of the week" in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]''.<ref>"All You Need Is Love" review, ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', [[14 March]] [[1987]].</ref><!-- ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=20 link])--> The JAMs re-edited and re-released the single, removing or doctoring the most antagonistic samples; lyrics from the song appeared as promotional graffiti, defacing selected billboards. The re-release rewarded The JAMs not just with further praise (including ''NME''&acute;s "single of the week",<ref>Kelly, D., "All You Need Is Love" review, ''[[New Musical Express]]'', [[23 May]] [[1987]].</ref><!-- ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=33 link])-->) but also with the funds necessary to record their debut album.

[[Image:The JAMS- Who Killed The JAMS? (rear).jpg|thumb|right|The back cover of ''[[Who Killed The JAMs?]]'' : a photograph of the bonfire of illegal ''1987'' discs.]]
The album, ''[[1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)]]'', was released in June 1987. Included was a song called "The Queen and I" ({{audio| The JAMs - The Queen and I (excerpt).ogg|sample}}), which sampled large portions of the [[ABBA]] single "[[Dancing Queen]]".<ref name="biog">"The KLF Biography", KLF BIOG 012, KLF Communications, December 1990([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=512 link])</ref> The recording came to the attention of ABBA's management and, after a legal showdown with ABBA<ref>Didcock, Barry, "Bitter Swede symphony", ''[[Sunday Herald]]'' ([[Glasgow]]), [[21 October]] [[2001]], p4.</ref> and the [[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society]], the ''1987'' album was forcibly withdrawn from sale. Drummond and Cauty travelled to [[Sweden]] in hope of meeting ABBA and coming to some agreement, taking an ''NME'' journalist and photographer with them, along with most of the remaining copies of the LP.<ref name=sweden87>"Thank You For The Music", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', [[17 October]] [[1987]].</ref> They failed to meet ABBA, so disposed of the copies by burning most of them in a field and throwing the rest overboard on the [[North Sea]] ferry trip home. In a December 1987 interview, Cauty maintained that they "felt that what [they]'d done was artistically justified."<ref name="tune">Smith, M., "The Great TUNE Robbery", ''[[Melody Maker]]'', [[12 December]] [[1987]] ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=52 link])</ref>

Two new singles followed ''1987'', on The JAMs' "KLF Communications" independent record label. Both reflected a shift towards house rhythms. According to ''NME'', The JAMs' choice of samples for the first of these, "[[Whitney Joins The JAMs]]" saw them leaving behind their strategy of "collision course" to "move straight onto the art of super selective theft".<ref>"Whitney Joins The JAMs" review, ''[[New Musical Express]]'', August 1987.</ref> The song uses samples of the ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'' theme alongside [[Whitney Houston|Whitney Houston's]] "[[I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)|I Wanna Dance With Somebody]]".  Ironically, Drummond has claimed that The KLF were later offered the job of producing or remixing a new Whitney Houston album as an inducement from her record label boss ([[Clive Davis]] of [[Arista]]) to sign with them.<ref name="X">Interview with Bill Drummond by Ernie Longmire, "KLF Is Going to Rock You" ''X Magazine'', July 1991 ([http://cardhouse.com/x07/klf.html link])</ref><ref name="Bomlagadafshipoing">Transcript of a Bill Drummond interview on "Bomlagadafshipoing" (Norwegian national radio house-music show), September 1991 ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=521 link]).</ref><ref>"JAMs turn down Whitney", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', [[16 November]] [[1991]] ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=261 link])</ref> Drummond turned the job down but nonetheless The KLF signed with Arista as their American distributors. The second single in this sequence<U+2014>Drummond and Cauty's third and final single of 1987<U+2014>was "[[Down Town]]", a rather more conventional dance record built around "[[Downtown (song)|Downtown]]" by 1960s star [[Petula Clark]].<ref>Reviewed by ''[[NME]]'' writer James Brown in the [[28 November]] [[1987]] edition.</ref> These early works were later collected on the compilation album ''[[Shag Times]]''.

A second album, ''[[Who Killed The JAMs?]]'' ({{audio| The JAMs - Burn the Bastards (excerpt).ogg|sample}}), was released in early 1988. ''Who Killed The JAMs?'' was a rather less haphazard affair than ''1987'' and earned The JAMs at least one five-star review (from ''Sounds'' Magazine, who called it "a masterpiece of pathos".<ref>"Who Killed The JAMs?" review, ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', February 1988.</ref>)

===The Timelords===
In 1988, Drummond and Cauty became "Time Boy" and "Lord Rock", and released a 'novelty' pop single, "[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]" ({{audio| The Timelords - Doctorin' the Tardis (excerpt).ogg|sample}}) as The Timelords. The song is predominantly a [[bastard pop|mash-up]] of the [[Doctor Who theme music|''Doctor Who'' theme music]] and [[Gary Glitter]]'s "Rock and Roll (Part Two)", with sparse vocals inspired by [[Dalek|The Daleks]] and [[Harry Enfield]]'s "Loadsamoney" character. "Doctorin' the Tardis" reached number one in the [[UK Singles Chart]] on [[12 June]], and charted highly in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].

[[Image:The Timelords- Doctorin' The Tardis (UK CDV).jpg|thumb|left|"[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]" ([[KLF Communications|KLFCD 003]])]]
Also credited on the record was "Ford Timelord", Cauty's 1968 [[Ford Galaxie]] American police car (claimed to have been used in the film ''Superman IV'' filmed in the UK). Drummond and Cauty declared that the car had spoken to them, giving its name as Ford Timelord, and advising the duo to become "The Timelords".

Drummond and Cauty would later portray the song as the result of a deliberate effort to write a number one hit single. However, in interviews with SnubTV and [[BBC Radio 1]],<ref name="skinner">Bill Drummond interviewed by [[Richard Skinner (broadcaster)|Richard Skinner]] on ''Saturday Sequence'', [[BBC Radio 1]], December 1990 ([http://www.brandnew.co.uk/klf/billdrummond/Bill%20Drummond%20Interview_Radio1%20Dec90.mp3 MP3])</ref> Drummond said that the truth was that they had intended to make a house record using the Dr Who theme. After Cauty had laid down a basic track, Drummond observed that their house idea wasn't working and what they actually had was a [[Gary Glitter|Glitter beat]]. Sensing the opportunity to make a commercial pop record they abandoned all notions of underground credibility and went instead for the lowest common denominator. According to the British music press, the result was "rancid",<ref name="sounds-timelords">Wilkinson, R., "...Ford Every Scheme", ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', [[28 May]] [[1988]]([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=81 link]).</ref> "pure, unadulterated agony" and "excruciating"<ref>,"Doctorin' the Tardis" review, ''[[Melody Maker]]'', [[28 May]] [[1988]] ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=78 link]).</ref> and<U+2014>in something of a backhanded compliment from the normally supportive ''Sounds'' Magazine<U+2014>"a record so noxious that a top ten place can be its only destiny".<ref name="sounds-timelords"/> They were right: the record went on to sell over one million copies.<ref name="select92">"Who Killed The KLF?", ''[[Select Magazine]]'', July 1992 ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=315 link]).</ref>  A single of The Timelords' remixes of the song was released: "Gary Joins The JAMs" featured original vocal contributions from Glitter himself, who also appeared on [[Top of the Pops]] to promote the song with The Timelords.

The Timelords released one other product, a 1989 book called ''[[The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)]]'', a tongue-in-cheek but nonetheless insightful step-by-step guide to achieving a number one hit single with no money and little talent.

===The KLF===
By the time the JAMs' single "Whitney Joins The JAMs" was released in September 1987, their record label had been renamed "KLF Communications" (from the earlier "The Sound of Mu(sic)"). However, the duo's first release as The KLF was not until March 1988, with the single "[[Burn the Bastards]]"/"[[Burn the Beat]]" (KLF 002). Although the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu name was not yet retired, most future Drummond and Cauty releases would go under the name "The KLF".

The name change accompanied a change in Drummond and Cauty's musical direction. Said Drummond (as 'King Boy D') in January 1988, "We might put out a couple of 12" records under the name The K.L.F., these will be rap free just pure dance music, so don't expect to see them reviewed in the music papers". King Boy D also claimed that he and Rockman Rock were "pissed off at [them]selves" for letting "people expect us to lead some sort of crusade for sampling".<ref name="info88">Drummond, B., KLF Communications Info Sheet, [[22 January]] [[1988]] ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=501 link]).</ref> In 1990 he recalled that "We wanted to make [as The KLF] something that was ... pure dance music, without any reference points, without any nod to the history of rock and roll. It was the type of music that by early '87 was really exciting ''me'' ... [although] we weren't able to get our first KLF records out until late '88".<ref name="skinner"/>

The 12" records subsequently released in 1988 and 1989 by The KLF were indeed rap free and house-oriented; remixes of some of The JAMs tracks, and new singles, the largely instrumental acid house anthems "[[What Time Is Love?]]" ({{audio| The KLF - What Time Is Love (Pure Trance version) (excerpt).ogg|sample}}) and "[[3 a.m. Eternal]]", the first incarnations of later international chart successes. The KLF described the sound of these new tracks as "Pure Trance".

In 1989 The KLF embarked upon the creation of a [[road movie]] and [[soundtrack album]], both titled ''[[The White Room (film)|The White Room]]'', funded by the profits of "Doctorin' The Tardis".<ref>Mellor, C. "Beam Me Up, Scotty - How to have a number one (The JAMs way)", ''Offbeat'' Magazine, February 1989 ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=94 link])</ref> Neither the film nor its soundtrack were formally released, although bootleg copies of both exist. The soundtrack album contained pop-house versions of some of the "pure trance" singles, as well as new songs, most of which would appear (albeit in radically reworked form) on the version of the album which was eventually released to mainstream success. A single from the original album was released, however: "[[Kylie Minogue|Kylie]] Said to [[Jason Donovan|Jason]]" ({{audio| The KLF - Kylie Said to Jason (excerpt).ogg|sample}}), an [[electropop]] record featuring references to [[Todd Terry]], [[Rolf Harris]], [[Skippy the Bush Kangaroo]] and BBC comedy programme ''[[The Good Life]]''. In reference to that song, Drummond and Cauty noted that they had worn "[[Pet Shop Boys]] infatuations brazenly on [their] sleeves".<ref>Sleevenotes, ''Indie Top 20 Volume 8'', published by Beechwood Music, catalogue number TT08, 1990.</ref>

The film project was frought with difficulties and setbacks, including dwindling funds. "Kylie Said To Jason", which Drummond and Cauty were hoping could "rescue them from the jaws of bankruptcy", flopped commercially, failing even to make the UK top-100 and forcing the entire film and soundtrack project to be put on hold.<ref name="info8">KLF Communications, "Information Sheet Eight", August 1990 ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=508 link])</ref>

[[Image:The KLF-The White Room (album cover).jpg|thumb|right|''[[The White Room]]'', The KLF's Stadium House tour-de-force ([[KLF Communications|KLF Communications JAMS LP6]])]]
Meanwhile, "What Time Is Love?" was generating acclaim within the underground clubs of continental Europe; according to KLF Communications, "The KLF were being feted by all the 'right' DJs".<ref name="info8" /> This prompted Drummond and Cauty to pursue the acid house tone of their Pure Trance series.  A further Pure Trance release, "[[Last Train to Trancentral]]" followed. At this time, Cauty had co-founded [[The Orb]] as an ambient side-project with [[Alex Paterson]]. Cauty and Paterson DJ-ed at the monthly "Land Of Oz" house night in London, and The KLF's seminal 1990 "ambient house" LP ''[[Chill Out (KLF album)|Chill Out]]'' ({{audio| The KLF - Chill Out (excerpt of Dream Time in Lake Jackson).ogg|sample}}) was born partly from these sessions. The ambient album ''[[Space (album)|Space]]'' and The KLF's ambient video ''[[The KLF films#Waiting|Waiting]]'' were also released in 1990, as was a heavier, more industrial sounding dance track, "[[It's Grim Up North]]", under The JAMs' moniker.

In 1990 The KLF launched a series of singles with an upbeat pop-house sound which they dubbed "Stadium House". Songs from ''The White Room'' soundtrack were re-recorded with rap and more vocals (by guests labelled "[[The KLF discography#Additional communicators|Additional Communicators]]"), a sample-heavy pop-rock production and crowd noise samples.  The results brought The KLF international recognition and acclaim.  The first "Stadium House" single, "What Time Is Love?", released in October 1990, reached #5 in the UK Singles Chart and hit the top-ten internationally.  The follow-up, "3 a.m. Eternal" ({{audio| The KLF - 3 a.m. Eternal (Live at the S.S.L.) (excerpt).ogg|sample}}), was an international top-five hit in January 1991, reaching #1 in the UK and #5 in the US [[Billboard Hot 100]].  The album ''[[The White Room]]'' followed in March 1991, reaching #3 in the UK.  A substantial reworking of the aborted soundtrack, the album featured a [[segue|segued]] series of "Stadium House" songs followed by [[downtempo]] tracks.

The KLF's chart success continued with the single "Last Train to Trancentral" ({{audio| The KLF - Last Train to Trancentral (Live from the Lost Continent) (excerpt).ogg|sample}}) (UK #2, #3 in the [[Eurochart Hot 100]]).<ref>"History Rewritten: The KLF biography", sleevenotes, ''Mu'', [[EMI|EMI Japan]] TOCP-6916, October 1991 ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=520 link]).</ref>  In December 1991, a re-working of a song from ''1987'', "[[Justified and Ancient]]" ({{audio| The KLF - Justified and Ancient (Stand by The JAMs) (excerpt).ogg|sample}}) was released, featuring the vocals of American country star [[Tammy Wynette]].  It was an international top-ten hit (UK #2, US #11), as was "[[America: What Time Is Love?]]" (UK #4), a hard, guitar-laden reworking of "What Time Is Love?".

In 1990 and 1991, The KLF also [[remix|remixed]] tracks by [[Depeche Mode]] ("[[Policy of Truth]]"), [[The Moody Boys]] ("What Is Dub?"), and the [[Pet Shop Boys]] ("So Hard" from the ''[[Behaviour (album)|Behaviour]]'' album and "It Must Be Obvious"). Pet Shop Boy [[Neil Tennant]] described the process: "When they did the remix of 'So Hard', they didn't do a remix at all, they re-wrote the record ... I had to go and sing the vocals again, they did it in a different way. I was impressed that Bill Drummond had written all the chords out and played it on an acoustic guitar, very thorough."<ref name="psb">Brown, J. "The Pet Shop Boys Versus The World", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 25 [[May 25]] [[1991]].</ref><!-- broken link:  ([http://microsites.nme.com/petshopboys/site/versus.html link])-->

After successive name changes and a plethora of highly influential dance records, Drummond and Cauty ultimately became, as The KLF, <!--Britain's (AMG says "the", no qualifier--> the biggest selling singles act in the world for 1991,<ref name="AMG">Bush, J., KLF biography, ''[[All Music Guide]]'' ([http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:2tkku3y5anok~T1 link])</ref> still incorporating the work of other artists but in less gratuitous ways and predominantly  without legal problems.

===Retirement===
On [[12 February]] [[1992]], The KLF and hardcore heavy metal group [[Extreme Noise Terror]] performed a live version of "[[3 a.m. Eternal]]" at the [[Brit Awards]], the [[British Phonographic Industry]]'s annual awards show, a "violently antagonistic performance" in front of "a stunned music-business audience".<ref>McCormick, N., "The Arts: My name is Bill, and I'm a popaholic", ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (London), [[2 March]] [[2000]], p27.</ref> Drummond and Cauty had planned to throw buckets of sheep's blood over the audience, but were prevented from doing so due to opposition from [[BBC]] lawyers<ref>"Brits behaving badly", BBC News Online, [[4 March]] [[2000]] ([http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/entertainment/2000/brit_awards/665776.stm link])</ref><ref name="baa">"Baa-nned!!

Later in the evening the band dumped a dead sheep with the message "I died for ewe<U+2014>bon appetit [sic]" tied around its waist at the entrance to one of the post-ceremony parties.<ref name="sheep-seats"/>

[[Image:Bill Drummond at the 1992 Brits Awards.jpg|left|thumb|Bill Drummond on vocals during The KLF and [[Extreme Noise Terror]]'s infamous appearance at the 1992 [[Brit Awards]].]]
Reactions were mixed. [[Piers Morgan]], writing in ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'', under the headline "KLF's Sick Gun Stunt Fails To Hit The Target", called The KLF "pop's biggest [[wiktionary:wally#Noun|wallies]]" <ref>"KLF's Sick Gun Stunt Fails To Hit The Target", ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'', [[13 February]] [[1992]] ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=286 link])</ref> and producer [[Trevor Horn]] is reported to have called their antics "disgusting".<ref name="sheep-seats"/> ''NME'', on the other hand, said that The KLF "stormed" the show and that after their performance the Brits show went "downhill all the way".<ref name="baa"/> 

[[Scott Piering|Scott Piering's]] announcement over the [[Public address|PA]] as the band left the stage that "The KLF have now left the music business" was largely ignored at the time. ''NME'', for example, assured their readers that the tensions and contradictions would continue to "push and spark" The KLF and that more "musical treasure" would be the result, but they noted: "[Drummond has] himself nicely skewered on the horns of an almighty dilemma. He has taken over pop music and it has been a piece of piss to do so. And he hates that. He wants to be separate from a music industry that clasps him ever closer to its bosom. He loves being in the very belly of the beast, yet he wishes he was something that'd cause it to throw up too. He wants not only to bite the hand that feeds but to shove it into an industrial mincer and stomp the resultant pulp into the dirt, yet pop, as long as you continue to make it money, would let you sexually abuse its grandmother. There is, Bill old boy, no sensible way out."<ref name="sheep-seats"/>

In the weeks following the Brits performance, The KLF continued working with Extreme Noise Terror on the album ''[[The Black Room]]'',<ref name="select92"/> but it was never finished. On [[May 14]] [[1992]], The KLF announced their immediate retirement from the music industry and the deletion of their entire back catalogue:
{{cquote|We have been following a wild and wounded, glum and glorious, shit but shining path these past five years. The last two of which has [sic] led us up onto the commercial high ground<U+2014>we are at a point where the path is about to take a sharp turn from these sunny uplands down into a netherworld of we know not what. For the foreseeable future there will be no further record releases from The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, The Timelords, The KLF and any other past, present and future name attached to our activities. As of now all our past releases are deleted.... If we meet further along be prepared...our disguise may be complete.<ref>KLF Communications advertisement in ''[[New Musical Express]]'', [[16 May]] [[1992]].</ref><ref>"Timelords gentlemen, please!", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', [[16 May]] [[1992]] ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=309 link])</ref>}}

In a comprehensive examination of The KLF's announcement and its context, [[Select Magazine|''Select'' Magazine]] called it "the last grand gesture, the most heroic act of public self destruction in the history of pop. And it's also Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty's final extravagant howl of self disgust, defiance and contempt for a music world gone foul and corrupt."<ref name="select92"/> Many of The KLF's friends and collaborators gave their reactions in the magazine. Movie director Bill Butt said that "Like everything, they're dealing with it in a very realistic way, a fresh, unbitter way, which is very often not the case. A lot of bands disappear with such a terrible loss of dignity".  Scott Piering said that "They've got a huge buzz off this, that's for sure, because it's something that's finally thrilling. It's scary to have thrown away a fortune which I ''know'' they have. Just the idea of starting over is exciting. Starting over on what? Well, they have such great ideas, like buying submarines". Even Kenny Gates, who, as a director of The KLF's distributors APT, stood to lose financially from the move, called it "Conceptually and philosophically ... absolutely brilliant". [[Mark Stent]] reported the doubts of many when he said that "I [have] had so many people who I know, heads of record companies, A&R men saying, 'Come on, It's a big scam.' But I firmly believe it's over". "For the very last spectacularly insane time", the magazine concluded, "The KLF have done what was least expected of them".

The final KLF Info sheet discussed the retirement in a typically offbeat fashion, and asked "What happens to 'Footnotes in rock legend'? Do they gather dust with Ashton Gardner and Dyke, the Vapours, and the [[Utah Saints]], or does their influence live on in unseen ways, permeating future cultures? A passing general of a private army has the answer. 'No', he whispers 'but the dust they gather is of the rarest quality. Each speck a universe awaiting creation, [[Big Bang]] just a dawn away'."<ref>KLF Communications Information Sheet #23, May 1992 ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=514 link])</ref>

There have been numerous suggestions that in 1992 Drummond was at the edge of a nervous breakdown.<ref name="select92"/><ref>Shaw, W., "Special K", ''[[GQ]]'' Magazine, April 1995 ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=397 link])</ref><ref>"[1992] had been the year of Bill's 'breakdown', when The KLF, perched on the peak of greater-than-ever success, quit the music business, (toy) machine gunned the tuxedo'd twats in the front row of that year's Brit Awards ceremony and dumped a sheep's carcass on the steps at the after-show party."

===K Foundation and post-retirement projects===
The [[K Foundation]] was an arts foundation established by Drummond and Cauty in 1993 following their 'retirement' from the music industry. From 1993 to 1995 they engaged in a number of art projects and media campaigns, including the high-profile [[K Foundation art award]] (for the "worst artist of the year").<ref>"The Best Of Artists, The Worst of Artists", ''[[New York Times]]'', [[29 November]] [[1993]] ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=366 link]).</ref><ref>Ellison, M.

[[Image:2K - Wheelchair.gif|thumb|left|Two "old reprobates": The KLF come out of retirement for 23 minutes to make an appearance as 2K.]]
In 1995, Drummond and Cauty contributed a song to ''[[The Help Album]]'' as The One World Orchestra ("featuring The Massed Pipes and Drums of the Children's Free Revolutionary Volunteer Guards").<ref>Discogs.com entry for "One World Orchestra, The" ([http://www.discogs.com/artist/One+World+Orchestra,+The discogs.com link])</ref> "The Magnificent" ({{audio| One World Orchestra - The Magnificent (excerpt).ogg|sample}}) is a [[drum'n'bass]] version of the theme tune from ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'', with vocal samples from DJ Fleka of Serbian radio station [[B92]]: "Humans against killing... that sounds like a junkie against dope".

In November 1995, the BBC aired an edition of the [[Omnibus (BBC)|Omnibus]] documentary series about The K Foundation entitled "A Foundation Course in Art".<ref>Reviewed by Sutcliffe, Thomas, ''[[The Independent]]'' ([[London]]) ISSN 09519467, [[7 November]] [[1995]], TV section p24.</ref> [[Jayne Casey]] (Drummond's former bandmate from Big in Japan) jokingly scolded Drummond on continuing to claim that he and Cauty were retired from the music business, as, she said, he had ''the [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]]'' (digital audio tape) in his pocket. At another point in the film, Cauty is shown rummaging in a bag for the DAT of "The Magnificent". Drummond is clearly heard to say "Make sure it isn't the DAT with 3 tracks on it". Only one track was ever released.

In 1997, ten years after their debut album ''[[1987 (album)|1987]]'', Drummond and Cauty re-emerged briefly as 2K.<ref name="billboard">Flint, C. "Media Pranksters KLF Re-emerge As 2K", ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'', [[2 September]] [[1997]] ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=496 link])</ref> 2K made a one-off performance at London's [[Barbican Arts Centre]] with [[Mark Manning]], [[Acid Brass]], the [[Liverpool Dockers]] and [[Alan Goodrick (Gimpo)|Gimpo]];<ref>"Justified and (Very) Ancient?", ''[[Melody Maker]]'', [[20 August]] [[1997]] ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=439 link])</ref> a performance at which "Two elderly gentlemen, reeking of [[Dettol]], caused havoc in their motorised [[wheelchair]]s.

These activities were accompanied by the usual full page press adverts, this time asking readers "***k The Millennium: Yes/No?" with a telephone number provided for voting. At the same time, Drummond and Cauty were also [[K2 Plant Hire]], with plans to build a "People's Pyramid" from used house bricks; this plan never reached fruition.<ref>"People's Pyramid", ''[[Melody Maker]]'', [[15 November]] [[1997]] ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=499 link])</ref><ref>"2K: Brickin' it!", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', Nov 97 ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=457 link])</ref>

Bill Drummond continues to work as a writer and conceptual artist. Jimmy Cauty has been involved in several post-KLF projects including the music and conceptual art collective [[Blacksmoke]] and the electronic music group the [[Transit Kings]], which saw him reunited with his former partner from The Orb, Alex Paterson.

==Themes==

Several threads and themes unify the many incarnations of Drummond and Cauty's creative partnership. Mostly these are esoteric or opaque in nature, which has lead some people to compare Drummond and Cauty's incarnations to [[The Residents]] for their antics, if not their music.<ref name="Stubbs">Stubbs, D. "Pranks for the Memory", ''[[Melody Maker]]'', [[16 February]] [[1991]] ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=202 link])</ref><ref>In his book ''[[45 (book)|45]]'' (Little & Brown, ISBN 0316853852 / Abacus, ISBN 0349112894), Drummond documented his love of The Residents as a concept ([http://www.theresidents.co.uk/articles/books/art_drum.html link]).</ref> Drummond and Cauty have also been compared to [[Stewart Home]] and the [[Neoist]]s.<ref>Extract from a feature on Stewart Home. Cornwell, J. ''[[i-D]]'' Magazine, Nov 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=354 link])</ref>

===Illuminatus!===

Drummond and Cauty made heavy references to Discordianism, a modern [[chaos]]-based religion originally described by [[Malaclypse The Younger]] in ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', but
popularised by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]] in the ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy|Illuminatus!]]'' books, published between [[1969 in literature|1969]] and [[1971 in literature|1971]].  The attitude and tactics of Drummond and Cauty's partnership matched that of the fictional cult whose name they had adopted.  Throughout the partnership, these tactics were often interpreted by media commentators as "pranks" or "[[publicity stunt]]s". However, according to Drummond, "That's just the way it was interpreted. We've always loathed the word scam. I know no-one's ever going to believe us, but we never felt we went out and did things to get reactions. Everything we've done has just been on a gut level instinct."<ref>Morton, R., "One Coronation Under A Groove", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', [[22 January]] [[1991]] ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=191 link]).</ref>

[[Image:The KLF - What Time Is Love video (Cornfields Version).jpg|right|thumb|The KLF's "T"-shaped speaker stack in the "[[What Time Is Love?]]" video]]
In addition to resembling the fictional JAMs attitudinally and tactically,  references to themes of Discordianism and ''Illuminatus!'' also manifested Drummond and Cauty's musical, visual and written work, meticulously and often covertly.

The JAMs' debut single "All You Need Is Love" includes the words "[[Immanentize the Eschaton]]!", in reference to the opening line of ''Illuminatus!'', "They immanentized the Eschaton", interpreted as "they brought about the end of the world" or "they brought heaven to Earth". The JAMs' "The Porpoise Song", from the album ''Who Killed The JAMs?'', in which King Boy D and a talking [[porpoise]] converse, references Howard, the talking porpoise in ''Illuminatus!''. The KLF's single version of "Last Train to Trancentral" opens with the demand "Okay, everybody lie down on the floor and keep calm", which is also taken from ''Illuminatus!''.

The refrain "All bound for Mu Mu land", from The KLF's final single, "Justified and Ancient (Stand by The JAMs)" is a reference to the [[Mu (lost continent)|Lost Continent of Mu]], which Shea and Wilson identify with the fictional land Lemuria in ''Illuminatus!''. Some research suggests that archeological remains located in waters off the coast of Japan may be Mu; at the end of the "Justified and Ancient" music video, The KLF exit in a submarine.

Drummond and Cauty's output is also highly [[self-reference|self-referential]], in common with ''Illuminatus!''. In particular, original vocal samples are reused in a variety of musical contexts.  For example, the [[ring modulation|ring modulated]] "Mu Mu!" sample that first appeared on "Burn the Bastards" is also to be found on "What Time Is Love? (Live at Trancentral), "Last Train to Trancentral (Live from the Lost Continent)" and "Fuck the Millennium".

The number [[23 (numerology)|23]], significant within [[numerology]], is a theme of ''Illuminatus!'', where instances of the number are both overtly and surreptitiously placed. Similarly, an abundance of such occurrences were deposited throughout Drummond and Cauty's collective output, for example:
<!--NOTE TO EDITORS: the following list is a *representative* selection to illustrate the types of occurrence of 23-->
* In lyrics to the song "Next" from the album ''1987'': "23 years is a mighty long time".
* In periods of time: for instance, they reportedly signed a contract preventing either of them from publicly discussing the burning of a million pounds for a period of 23 years;<ref>K Foundation, "Cape Wrath" advertisement, in ''[[The Guardian]]'' (''G2''), [[8 December]] [[1995]]([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=519 link]).</ref> their 1997 return as 2K was "for 23 minutes only".<ref name="2K">2K press advert ([http://www.mutelibtech.com/mute/2k/2k1.htm link], [http://www.mutelibtech.com/mute/2k/2kpress.htm overview])</ref>
* In numbering schemes: the debut single "All You Need Is Love" took the catalogue number JAMS 23, while the final KLF Communications Information Sheet was numbered 23; and Cauty's Ford Galaxie police car had on its roof the identification mark 23.
* In significant dates during their work: for instance, a rare public appearance by The KLF, at the Liverpool Festival of Comedy, was on [[23 June]] [[1991]]; they announced the winner of the K Foundation award on [[23 November]] [[1991]];<ref>"K-Foundation nailed", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', [[11 December]] [[1993]] ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=368 link])</ref> and they burned one million pounds on [[23 August]] [[1994]].<ref name="burning"/>

When questioned on the importance that he attaches to this number, Drummond has been evasive, responding enigmatically "I know. But I'm not going to tell, because then other people would have to stop having to wonder and the thing about beauty is for other people to wonder at it. It's not very beautiful once you know".<ref name="i-D">"Freak Show", ''[[i-D]]'' magazine, December 1994 ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=392 link]).</ref> Drummond's penchant for living by numbers has also been observed in his choosing to align the ages at which he undertook creative projects ''The Man'' and ''[[45 (book)|45]]'' with the standard revolution speeds of a turntable (33.3 and 45 rpm).

[[Image:PBlaster.JPG|left|thumb|The "Pyramid Blaster" logo.]]

The "Pyramid Blaster"<ref name="info8" /> is a logo and [[iconography|icon]] frequently and prominently depicted within the duo's collective work: a pyramid, in front of which is suspended a [[ghetto blaster]] displaying the word "Justified". This references the [[Eye of Providence|All-Seeing Eye]] icon, often depicted as an eye within a triangle or pyramid, a significant symbol of ''Illuminatus!''. The pyramid was also a theme of the duo's 1997 re-emergence, with the proposed building by [[K2 Plant Hire]] of "a massive pyramid containing one brick for every person born in the UK during the 20th century".<ref>''[[Fortean Times]]'', referencing ''[[The Big Issue]]'', [[15 September]] [[1997]] and ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[5 November]] [[1997]] ([http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/107_sdays.shtml link]).</ref>

There is no definitive explanation of The KLF's name, nor of the origin of 'K' in the names of the K Foundation and 2K. KLF has been variously reported as being an [[acronym]] for "Kopyright Liberation Front", "[[Kallisti]] Liberation Front" and "Kings of the Low Frequencies". This mirrors ''Illuminatus!'', where the fictional JAMs are in alliance with The LDD<U+2014>who regularly change the origins of their name<U+2014>and The ELF ("[[Eris|Erisian]] Liberation Front").

Although Drummond accounted for the adoption of The JAMs name in the first KLF Communications Info Sheet, the reasoning behind Drummond and Cauty's decision to reference the ''Illuminatus!'' mythology with such consistent intricacy is unknown. Indeed, it has been suggested by journalist [[Steven Poole]] that the public's inability to fully understand The KLF results in all their subsequent activities (as a partnership or otherwise) being absorbed into The KLF's mystique. In a review of Drummond's 1999 book, ''[[45 (book)|45]]'', and an appraisal of The KLF's career, Poole stated that "[Bill Drummond] and collaborator Jimmy Cauty are the only true [[conceptual artist]]s of the [1990s]. And for all the [[eldritch]] beauty of their art, their most successful creation is the myth they have built around themselves."<ref>[[Steven Poole|Poole, S.]], "Hit man, myth maker<U+2014>''45''", ''[[The Observer]]'', [[26 February]] [[2000]] ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=487 link])</ref> He concluded,
{{cquote|A myth like The KLF's is peculiarly omnivorous. Just as there can never be any evidence to disprove a conspiracy theory because the fabrication of such evidence<U+2014>don't you see?<U+2014>is itself part of the conspiracy, so the pop myth of The KLF can never be blown apart by anything they do, no matter how dumb or embarrassing. The myth will suck it up, like a black hole.}}

===Trancentral, Eternity, Sheep===

[[Trancentral]] (aka the Benio<ref>Mead, H. (1990), ''Chill Out'' review, ''[[New Musical Express]]'' ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=123 link]).</ref>) was the operations centre of The KLF, their mythological home, and their studios. Despite the grandiose lyrics of "Last Train To Trancentral", Trancentral was in fact Cauty's residence in [[Stockwell]], [[South London]], "a large and rather grotty [[Squatting|squat]]" said David Stubbs in ''[[Melody Maker]]''. "Jimmy has lived [there] for 12 years. ('I hate the place. I've no alternative but to live here.') There's little evidence of fame or fortune. The kitchen is heated by means of leaving the three functioning gas rings on at full blast until the fumes make us all feel stoned.... And, pinned just above a working top cluttered with chipped mugs is a letter from a five-year-old fan, featuring a crayon drawing of the band."<ref name="Stubbs"/> 

[[Eternity]] is a recurring theme in song titles ("3 a.m. Eternal", "Madrugada Eterna") and lyrics, and also Drummond and Cauty asserted that 'Eternity' was the author of an ambiguous, far-reaching contract offered to The JAMs.<ref name="info8" /> See [[The White Room (film)|The KLF films: ''The White Room'']].

Following the February 1990 release of ''Chill Out'', [[sheep]] had recurring roles in the duo's output until their 1992 retirement. Drummond has claimed that the use of sheep on the ''Chill Out'' cover was intended to evoke contemporary rural [[rave]]s,<ref name="X" /> and insisted that the dead sheep gesture at the Brit Awards was a compromise, replacing his earlier intention to literally cut off his hand at the ceremony.<ref name="burning"/> Sheep feature in The KLF ambient video ''Waiting'', and some sheep were guests of honour at the launch of The KLF's ultimately unreleased film ''The White Room''. It is unclear whether the theme of sheep had any particular artistic meaning. Indeed, the inner sleeve of ''The White Room'' CD pictured Drummond and Cauty each holding a sheep, with the caption "Why sheep?".

===Ceremonies and journeys===

Drummond and Cauty's work often involved notions of ceremony and journey.  Journeys are the subject of the KLF Communications recordings ''Chill Out'', ''Space'', "Last Train to Trancentral", ''The White Room'', "Justified and Ancient" and "America: What Time Is Love?", as well as the aborted film project ''The White Room''.  In his book ''45'', Drummond expressed his admiration for the work of artist [[Richard Long]], who incorporates physical journeys into his art.<ref>[[Bill Drummond|Drummond, B.]], "A Smell Of Money Under Ground", ''[[45 (book)|45]]'', Little & Brown, ISBN 0316853852 / Abacus, ISBN 0349112894, 2000.</ref>  

Fire and sacrifice were recurring ceremonial themes: Drummond and Cauty made fires to dispose of their illegal debut album and to sacrifice The KLF's profits; their dead sheep gesture of 1992 carried a sacrificial message.  The KLF's short film ''[[The Rites of Mu]]'' depicts their celebration of the 1991 [[summer solstice]] on the [[Hebrides|Hebridean]] island of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]]: a 60-foot tall [[wicker]] man was burnt at a ceremony in which journalists were asked to wear yellow and grey robes and join a [[chant]].<ref name="i-D" />  Chanting also featured in "3 a.m. Eternal", ''Chill Out'' and<U+2014>aggressively<U+2014>"Fuck the Millennium".

===Promotion===

[[Image:K-Foundation - Fuck the Millenium Advert.jpg|right|thumb|180px|A K2 Plant Hire advertisement, exhibiting the stark quality of Drummond and Cauty's press adverts, and the characteristic typeface.]]
Drummond and Cauty's promotional tactics were unconventional.  The duo were renowned for their distinctive and humorous public appearances (including several on [[Top of the Pops]]), at which they were often costumed.<ref>Frith, M., "The Return of The KLF", ''[[Sky magazine|Sky]]'', October 1997 ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=445 link]).</ref> <ref name="Stubbs" />  They granted few interviews, communicating instead via semi-regular newsletters, or cryptically phrased full-page adverts in UK national newspapers and the music press.  Such adverts were typically stark, comprising large white lettering on black.  A single [[typeface]] became characteristic of all KLF Communications' output, being used almost exclusively on sleevenotes and record labels, merchandise and adverts.

From the outset of their collaborations, Drummond and Cauty practised the [[guerrilla communication]] tactic that they described as "illegal but effective use of [[graffiti]] on [[Billboard (advertising)|billboards]] and public buildings" in which "the original meaning of the advert would be totally subverted".<ref name="biog" /> Much as The JAMs' early recordings carried messages on the back of existing musical works, their promotional graffiti often derived its potency from the context in which it was placed. For instance, The JAMs' "SHAG SHAG SHAG" graffiti, coinciding with their release of "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs)|All You Need Is Love]]", was drawn over the "HALO HALO HALO" slogan of a ''[[Today (newspaper)|Today]]'' billboard that depicted [[Greater Manchester]] Police Chief Constable [[James Anderton]], who had decried [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] amidst the UK media's AIDS furore.

Music press journalists were occasionally invited to witness the defacements. In December 1987, a ''Melody Maker'' reporter was in attendance to see Cauty reverse his car Ford Timelord alongside a billboard and stand on its roof to graffiti a [[Christmas]] message from The JAMs.<ref name="tune">Smith, M., "The Great TUNE Robbery", ''[[Melody Maker]]'', [[12 December]] [[1987]] ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=52 link])</ref> In February 1991, another ''Melody Maker'' journalist watched The KLF deface a billboard advertising ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', doctoring the slogan "[[Gulf War|THE GULF]]: the coverage, the analysis, the facts" by painting a 'K' over the 'GU'. Drummond and Cauty were, on this occasion, caught at the scene by police and arrested, later to be released without charge.<ref name="Stubbs" />

In November 1991, the slogan "It's Grim Up North" appeared as graffiti on the junction of London's [[M25 motorway|M25]] orbital motorway with the [[M1 motorway|M1]], which runs to Northern England. The graffiti, for which The JAMs denied responsibility, led to a [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] motion being timetabled by [[Member of Parliament]] [[Joseph Ashton (politician)|Joe Ashton]] regarding regional imbalance.<ref>"The JAMs: centre of political interest", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', [[9 November]] [[1991]] ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=258 link]).</ref> In September 1997, on the day after Drummond and Cauty's brief remergence as 2K, the graffiti "1997: What The Fuck's Going On?" appeared on the outside wall of London's [[National Theatre (UK)|National Theatre]], ten years after the slogan "1987: What The Fuck's Going On?" had been similarly placed to mark the release of The JAMs' debut album.<ref>"Pre-millennium tension hits new high", ''[[New Musical Express]]'' [[27 September]] [[1997]] ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=465 link]).</ref>

==Legacy==

Despite their protestations of 1988 about not wishing to be seen as crusaders for sampling,<ref name="info88" /> The JAMs continue to be associated with the cultural movement which retrospectively bundles together those literary and artistic works that make use of 'creative plagiarism'. ''1987: What the Fuck Is Going On?'', is considered a landmark work in the early history of [[sampling (music)|sampling]] music in the United Kingdom. (See [[Bastard pop#The JAMs and The KLF|Bastard pop]].)

[[Image:KLF - J&A ice cream ad.jpg|thumb|right|KLF Communications' advert for "[[Justified and Ancient]]", with a quote from the lyrics: "They travel the world in their [[ice cream van]], they've voyaged to the bottom of time. They've been to the place where the Mu-Mu mate, and the children still cry 'Mine's a [[99 Flake|99]]!'"]]
Similarly, ''Chill Out'' is cited as "one of the essential ambient albums".<ref>Bush, J., [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:lif6zf0hehak ''Chill Out'' review], [[All Music Guide]]. Retrieved [[6 April]] [[2006]].</ref> In 1996, ''[[Mixmag]]'' named ''Chill Out'' the fifth best "dance" album of all time, describing Cauty's DJ sets with The Orb's Alex Paterson as "seminal".<ref>Philips, D., "50 Greatest Dance Albums: # 5", ''[[Mixmag]]'', March 1996 ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=478 link]).</ref>

''The Guardian'' have credited The KLF with inventing "stadium house"<ref>O'Reilly, J. "The horny old devils", ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[29 August]] [[1997]] ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=437 link])</ref> and ''NME'' named The KLF's stadium house album ''The White Room'' the 81st best album of all time.<ref>http://microsites.nme.com/top100/site/90.html</ref><ref>http://microsites.nme.com/reviews/top100.html</ref> Elements of The KLF's stadium house concept (sampled crowd noise, and signatory vocal samples reused on different songs) were adopted by several less successful rave acts of the early 1990s, including [[Utah Saints]], [[N-Joi]] and [[Messiah (band)|Messiah]].

''[[Sound on Sound]]'' magazine credited The KLF with "set[ting] the trend for a new approach to mixing". Engineer [[Mark Stent]] is quoted as saying:{{Cquote|It was in working with Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty that things really started to happen in a new way, using mixing as a work-in-progress, rather than an end stage. We were running everything live in the studio, from [[Music sequencer|sequencers]] and samplers. Obviously there was also stuff on tape, but they would come in with their [[Atari]]s and Akai samplers, and we would end up rearranging the whole song whilst mixing things. They would then take away what we did, work on it again, and come back a while later, and I'd mix stuff again. My KLF work put me in the picture, and after that the phone never stopped ringing.<ref name="SoS">[[Mark Stent]], in Tingen, P.

<!--The name "KLF" also appears prominently in the Japanese [[Anime|animated]] show [[Eureka Seven|K<U+014D>ky<U+014D>shihen Eureka Seven]], among many other nods to American countercultural movements and electronic music.-->

===Opinions of contemporaries===

In 1991, [[Chris Lowe]] of the Pet Shop Boys said that he considered the only other worthwhile group in the UK to be The KLF. [[Neil Tennant]] added that "They have an incredibly recognisable sound. I liked it when they said [[EMF (band)|EMF]] nicked the F from KLF.<ref>Morton, R. "One Coronation Under A Groove", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', [[12 January]] [[1991]] ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=191])</ref> They're from a different tradition to us in that they're pranksters and we've never been pranksters." <ref name="psb"/>

At the time of The KLF's retirement announcement, Drummond's old friend and colleague [[David Balfe]] said of Drummond's KLF career that "the path he's trod[den] is a more artistic one than mine. I know that deep down I like the idea of building up a very successful career, where Bill is more interested in weird stuff.... I think the very avoidance of cliche has become their particular cliche".<ref name="select92"/>

In March 1994, members of the anarchist band [[Chumbawumba]] expressed their respect for The KLF.  [[Alice Nutter (musician)|Alice Nutter]] referred to The KLF as "real situationists" categorising them as political musicians alongside [[The Sex Pistols]] and [[Public Enemy]].  [[Dunst Bruce]] lauded the K-Foundation, concluding "I think the things The KLF do are fantastic. I'm a vegetarian but I wish they'd sawn an elephant's legs off at the Brit Awards."<ref>[[Stuart Maconie|Maconie, S.]], Chumbawumba interview, ''[[Select Magazine|Select]]'', March 1994 ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=378 link]).</ref>

===Direct influence===

The KLF have been imitated to some degree by German techno band [[Scooter (band)|Scooter]], and were themselves apparently the victims of a "hoax" when an outfit called "1300 Drums featuring the Justified Ancients of M.U." released a novelty single to cash-in on the popularity of [[Manchester United]] footballer [[Eric Cantona]]. 1300 Drums even made a KLF-style [[Top of the Pops]] appearance, with the "band" wearing Cantona masks. The authorship of "Ooh Aah" remains unresolved: at least one source maintains that Drummond and Cauty ''were'' 1300 Drums.<ref>RedMuze biography of The KLF at [[BBC Online]] ([http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/artists/k/klf/ link])</ref>

The Timelords' book, ''The Manual'', was reportedly used by the one-hit-wonders [[Edelweiss (band)|Edelweiss]] to secure their number one hit "Bring Me Edelweiss".<ref name="X-not-Bill">Longmire, E. "KLF Is Going to Rock You" ''X Magazine'', July 1991 ([http://cardhouse.com/x07/klf.html link])</ref> <ref>Reighley, K.B. "Hear No Evil", ''[[Seattle Weekly]]'', [[26 May]] [[1999]] ([http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/9921/two-reighley.php link])</ref>

"Last Train to Trancentral (Live from the Lost Continent)" is used in the finale of the [[Blue Man Group]]'s theatrical show, ''[[The Complex (Blue Man Group)|The Complex Rock Tour]]'', which features pieces from "The Rock Concert Instruction Manual", a tongue-in-cheek deconstruction of pop music and the rock concert experience. Their album ''[[Audio (Blue Man Group)|Audio]]'' also uses samples from The KLF's ''The White Room''.

===Career retrospectives===

In 1992, ''NME'' referred to The KLF as "Britain's greatest pop group" and "the two most brilliant minds in pop today",<ref name="sheep-seats"/> and in 2002 listed the duo in their "Top 50 Icons" at number 48.<ref>"Top 50 NME Icons", ''[[New Musical Express]]''. See also "Roll over, Beatles - Smiths top the pops: Oldies and goldies in hall of fame", ''[[The Guardian]]'' ([[Manchester]]), [[17 April]] [[2002]], "Guardian Home Pages" section, p6.</ref><!-- 404: ([http://microsites.nme.com/nme50/index.html link])--> The British music paper also listed The KLF's 1992 Brits Awards appearance at number 4 in their "top 100 rock moments".<ref>[http://microsites.nme.com/rock100/site/4.html "100 Rock Moments"], NME.com. Retrieved [[21 April]] [[2006]].</ref> In 2003, ''[[The Observer]]'' named The KLF's departure from the music business (and the Brits performance in which the newspaper says "their legend was sealed") the fifth greatest "publicity stunt" in the history of popular music ([[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] joining the army being hailed as the greatest).<ref>Thompson, B. "The 10 greatest publicity stunts", ''[[The Observer]]'', [[27 September]] [[2003]] ([http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/the10/story/0,11109,1043955,00.html link])</ref>

In a largely cynical piece, ''[[Trouser Press]]'' reviewer Ira Robbins referred to The KLF's body of work as "a series of colorful sonic marketing experiments".<ref name="Trouserpress"/>

Drummond and Cauty have made frequent appearances in the British [[broadsheet]]s since The KLF's retirement, most often in connection with the K Foundation and their [[Watch the K-Foundation Burn a Million Quid|burning of a million quid]]. It is worth noting that The KLF in their various incarnations have been to an extent "media darlings" who have received largely unqualified praise from the printed media. This may or may not be due to what ''NME'' called their "Master[y] of manipulating media and perceptions of themselves".<ref>"Fresh JAMMS?", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', [[6 September]] [[2001]] ([http://www.nme.com/news/41844.htm])</ref> (Similarly, ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' magazine called them "noted self-publicists" and "media pranksters".<ref name="billboard"/>)

==Instrumentation==
<!-- http://www.xmission.com/pub/lists/klf/archive/v02.n347 -->

Early releases by The JAMs, including the album ''1987'', were performed using an [[Apple II]] computer with a Greengate DS3 sampler [[Apple II peripheral cards|peripheral card]], and a [[Roland TR-808]] drum machine.<ref>[[KLF Communications]], sleevenotes, "1987: The JAMs 45 Edits", JAMS 23T, 1987.</ref>  On later releases, the Greengate DS3 and Apple II were replaced with an [[Akai S900]] sampler and an [[Atari]] computer respectively.<ref name="SoS" />  The house music of [[Space (album)|Space]]<!--this should not be italicised, the prose is referring to artist, not album--> and The KLF involved much original instrumentation, for which the [[Oberheim OB-8]] analogue synthesiser was prominently used.<ref name="LP6">[[KLF Communications]], sleevenotes, ''[[The White Room]]'', JAMS LP6, 1991.</ref>

The KLF's 1990<U+2013>1992 singles and ''The White Room'' LP were [[record producer|mixed]] by [[Mark Stent]], using a [[Solid State Logic]] (S.S.L.) automated mixing desk.  This is referenced in the subtitle of The KLF single "3 a.m. Eternal (Live at the S.S.L.)".  The [[Roland TB-303]] bassline and [[Roland TR-909]] drum machine feature on "What Time Is Love (Live at Trancentral)".<ref name="LP6" />

Several of Drummond and Cauty's compositions feature distinctive original instrumentation using non-synthesised instruments. Drummond played a [[Gibson ES-330]] semi-acoustic guitar on "America: What Time Is Love?",<ref name="USA4">[[KLF Communications]], sleevenotes, "America: What Time Is Love?", KLF USA4, 1992.</ref> and Cauty played [[electric guitar]] on "Justified and Ancient (Stand by The JAMs)" and "America: What Time Is Love?".  [[Graham Lee (Australian musician)|Graham Lee]] provided prominent [[pedal steel]] contributions to The KLF's ''[[Chill Out]]'' and "Build a Fire".  Duy Khiem played [[clarinet]] on "3 a.m. Eternal" and "Make It Rain".<ref name="LP6" />  The KLF track "America No More" features a [[pipe band]],<ref name="USA4" /> and 2K's "Fuck The Millennium" incorporates a full [[brass band]].
