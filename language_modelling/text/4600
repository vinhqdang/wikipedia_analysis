The town is then forced to completely move five miles away.<br/>Guest stars: [[U2]] & [[Steve Martin]]<ref>Gimple, p. 38-39</ref>

 |ShortSummary=Bart becomes disappointed with his father after he is unable to finish a race.  Seeing this, Homer decides to go to a gym every night to exercise, while eating an energy bar called "Powersauce" and being trained by [[Rainier Wolfcastle]].  Soon, Homer is much slimmer and more muscular.  One night at the gym, two representatives of the energy bar come to Wolfcastle to try persuade him to climb Murderhorn Mountain, the tallest mountain in Springfield, as a publicity stunt for the energy bar.  After refusing, Bart tells the representatives to ask Homer, who agrees to climb the mountain.  To make sure Homer gets to the top, the company hires two [[Sherpas]] to drag Homer up the mountain during the night.  However, Homer soon realizes the Sherpas are doing this, and fires them so that he can climb solo.  After much climbing, Homer believes he has finally made it to the top, but then sees that he has only made it to a plateau of the mountain.  Feeling that he cannot climb any higher, Homer places a flag where he is. This creates a crack which breaks the top of the mountain off, making the plateau Homer was standing on to become the peak.  After climbing back down, Bart shows that he is proud of his father again.<br/>Guest stars: [[Brendan Fraser]] & [[Steven Weber]].<ref>Gimple, p. 40</ref>

 |ShortSummary=When Bart comes home with some novelty items [[superglue]]d to his face, Marge takes him to the emergency room, causing Lisa to no longer be able to go the Springfield Museum to see a temporary exhibit with her mother on its last day. Marge does not let Lisa take a bus to the museum, but Lisa is able to manipulate her father for his permission to take the bus. However, Lisa takes the wrong bus and ends up in the middle of nowhere.  Meanwhile, Homer realizes that he should not have given Lisa permission to take the bus by herself. He rushes to the museum to find her, but she has managed to get downtown after much travel.  Near the museum, Homer decides to use a [[cherry picker]] to locate Lisa, but the cherry picker loses control and falls into the pier, and floats off to a [[drawbridge]].  Lisa sees this, and quickly tells the bridge operator to lower the bridge, which catches Homer by his head to save him.  Unfortunately, the exhibit is closed, but Homer promises to break into the museum at night with Lisa, where the two discover one of the exhibits' objects is a [[musical box]].<ref>Gimple, p. 41</ref>
