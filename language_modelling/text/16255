'''Darius I''' ([[Old Persian]]: ''D<U+0101>rayava(h)u<U+0161>''; [[New Persian]]: <U+062F><U+0627><U+0631><U+06CC><U+0648><U+0634> <U+0628><U+0632><U+0631><U+06AF> c. 550<U+2013>486 BCE) was the third king of the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]]. Also called '''Darius the Great''', he ruled the empire at its peak, when it included much of [[West Asia]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Central Asia]], parts of the [[Balkans]] ([[Bulgaria]]-[[Pannonia]]), portions of north and northeast Africa including [[History of Achaemenid Egypt|Egypt]] (Mudr<U+00E2>ya),<ref>http://www.livius.org/be-bm/behistun/behistun-t02.html#1.9-17</ref> eastern [[Libya]], coastal [[Sudan]], [[Eritrea]],  as well as most of [[Pakistan]], the [[Aegean Islands]] and northern [[Greece]] / [[Thrace]]-[[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. Darius is also mentioned in the [[Biblical canon]] of [[1 Esdras]]. 

Darius ascended the throne by overthrowing [[Gaumata]], the alleged [[magus]] usurper of [[Bardiya]] with the assistance of six other Persian noble families; Darius was [[Coronation|crowned]] the following morning. The new king met with rebellions throughout his kingdom and quelled them each time. A major event in Darius's life was his expedition to punish [[Athens]] and [[Eretria]] for their aid in the [[Ionian Revolt]] and subjugate [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. Darius expanded his empire by conquering [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]] and invading [[Scythia]], home of the Scythians, nomadic tribes who invaded [[Medes|Media]] and had previously killed [[Cyrus the Great]].

Darius organized the empire by dividing it into provinces and placing [[satrap]]s to govern it. He organized a new uniform monetary system, along with making [[Official Aramaic language|Aramaic]] the official language of the empire. Darius also worked on construction projects throughout the empire, focusing on [[Susa]], [[Pasargadae]], [[Persepolis]], [[Babylon]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. Darius devised a codification of laws for [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. He also had the cliff-face [[Behistun Inscription]] carved, an autobiography of great modern [[Linguistics|linguistic]] significance. Darius also started many massive [[Achaemenid architecture|architectural projects]], including magnificent palaces in [[Persepolis]] and [[Susa]].

==Etymology==
{{lang|la|''D<U+0101>r<U+012B>us''}} (or {{lang|la|''D<U+0101>r<U+0113>us''}}) is the [[Latin]] form of the Greek {{lang|el-Latn|''Dare<U+00EE>os''}}, which is a shortened form of the Old Persian {{lang|peo-Latn|''D<U+0101>rayavau<U+0161>''}}. The Old Persian form is also seen to have been reflected in the [[Elamite language|Elamite]] {{lang|elx-Latn|''Da-ri-(y)a-ma-u-i<U+0161>''}}, [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] {{lang|akk-Latn|''Da-(a-)ri-ia-(a-)mu<U+0161>''}}, [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] {{lang|arc-Latn|''dryhw<U+0161>''}} and archaizing ''drywhw<U+0161>'', and possibly the longer Greek form ''Dareia<U+00EE>os''. The translation of his name from Old Persian to English is "holding firm the good", which can be seen by the stem ''d<U+0101>raya'', meaning "hold", and the adjective ''vau'', meaning "good".{{sfn|Shahbazi|1996|p=40}}

{{see also|Behistun Inscription|Herodotus}}
Darius left a tri-lingual monumental relief on [[Mount Behistun]] which was written in [[Elamite]], [[Old Persian]] and [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]] between his coronation and his death. The inscription begins with a brief autobiography with his ancestry and lineage. To aid the presentation of his ancestry, Darius wrote down the sequence of events which occurred after the death of [[Cyrus the Great]].{{sfn|Duncker|1882|p=192}}{{sfn|Egerton|1994|p=6}} Darius mentions several times that he is the rightful king by the grace of [[Ahura Mazda]], the [[Zoroastrian]] God. In addition, further texts and monuments from Persepolis have been found, including a fragmentary [[Old Iranian]] inscription from Gherla, Romania (Harmatta) and a letter from Darius to Gadates, preserved in a Greek text of the Roman period.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1996|p=41}}

Herodotus, a Greek historian and author of ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', provided an account of many Persian kings and the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. He wrote an extensive amount of information on Darius which spans half of book 3, along with books 4, 5 and 6. It begins with the removal of the alleged usurper [[Gaumata]] and continues to the end of Darius's reign.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1996|p=41}}

The [[Book of Ezra]] (chapter 6, verses 1 to 11) describes the decree to continue reconstruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, specifying financial support and supplies for the temple services. This decree is dated approximately 519 BCE.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pfandl|first=Gerhard|title=Daniel: The Seer of Babylon|year=2004|publisher=Herald Publishing Association|page=95|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=82twQKRNuiIC&pg=PA95#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> Between Cyrus and Darius, an exchange of letters with King Ahasuerus and Artaxerxes is described (chapter 4, verse 7), the grandson of Darius I, in whose reign Ezra and Nehemiah came to Jerusalem.

== Early life ==
Darius was born as the eldest of five sons to [[Hystaspes (father of Darius I)|Hystaspes]] and Rhodugune in 550 BCE. Hystaspes was a leading figure of authority in [[Persia]], which was the homeland of the Persians. [[Behistun Inscription|Darius's inscription]] states that his father was [[satrap]] of [[Bactria]] in 522 BCE. According to [[Herodotus]], Hystaspes was the satrap of Persis, although most historians state that this is an error. Also according to Herodotus (III.139), Darius, prior to seizing power and "of no consequence at the time", had served as a spearman (''doryphoros'') in the Egyptian campaign (528<U+2013>525 BCE) of [[Cambyses II]], then the Persian Great King.{{sfn|Cook|1985|p=217}} Hystaspes was an officer in [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]]'s army and a noble of his court.{{sfn|Abbott|2009|p=14}}

Before Cyrus and his army crossed the [[Aras River]] to battle with northern tribes, he installed his son [[Cambyses II]] as king in case he should not return from battle.{{sfn|Abbott|2009|p=14-15}} However, once Cyrus had crossed the Aras River he had a dream with a vision of Darius in which he had wings atop his shoulders and stood upon the confines of Europe and Asia (the whole known world). When Cyrus awoke from the dream, he inferred it as a great danger to the future security of the empire, as it meant that Darius would one day rule the whole world. However, his son Cambyses was the heir to the throne, not Darius, causing Cyrus to wonder if Darius was forming treasonable and ambitious designs. This led Cyrus to order Hystaspes to go back to [[Persis]] and watch over his son strictly, until Cyrus himself returned.{{sfn|Abbott|2009|p=15-16}} Darius did not seem to have any treasonous thoughts as Cambyses II ascended the throne peacefully, and through promotion Darius was eventually elevated to Cambyses's personal [[lancer]].

== Accession ==
{{see also|Gaumata (False Smerdis)}}
The rise of Darius to the throne contains two variations, an account from Darius and another from Greek historians. Some modern historians have inferred that Darius's rise to power might have been illegitimate. To them, it seems likely that Gaumata was in fact Bardiya, and that under cover of revolts, Darius killed the heir to the throne and took it himself.{{sfn|Boardman|1988|p=53}}

Darius's account, written at the Behistun Inscription states that Cambyses II killed his own brother [[Bardiya]], but that this murder was not known among the [[Iranian people]]. A would-be [[usurper]] named Gaumata came and lied to the people, stating he was Bardiya.{{sfn|Boardman|1988|p=54}} The Iranians had grown rebellious against Cambyses's rule and on 11 March 522 BCE a revolt against Cambyses broke out in his absence. On 1 July, the Iranian people chose to be under the leadership of Gaumata, as "Bardiya". No member of the Achamenid family would rise against Gaumata for the safety of their own life. Darius, who had served Cambyses as his lance-bearer until the deposed ruler's death, prayed for aid and in September 522 BCE, along with [[Otanes]], [[Intraphrenes]], [[Gobryas]], [[Hydarnes]], Megabyxus and [[Aspathines]], killed Gaumata in the fortress of Sikayauvati.{{sfn|Boardman|1988|p=54}}

Herodotus provides a dubious account of Darius's ascension: Several days after Gaumata had been assassinated, Darius and the other seven nobles discussed the fate of the empire. At first, the seven discussed the form of government; a democratic republic was strongly pushed by [[Otanes]], an oligarchy was pushed by Megazybus, while Darius pushed for a monarchy. After stating that a republic would lead to corruption and internal fighting, while a monarchy would be led with a single-mindedness not possible in other governments, Darius was able to convince the other nobles that a monarchy was the correct form of government. To decide who would become the monarch, the six nobles (Otanes stated that he had no interest in becoming king) decided on a test. All six nobles would gather outside mounted on their horses at sunrise, and the nobles' horse which neighed first would become Great King. According to Herodotus, Darius had a slave, [[Oebares]] who helped Darius win this contest. Before the contest, Oebares rubbed his hand over the genitals of a mare that Darius's horse had a fondness for. When the six nobles gathered outside, Oebares placed his hands beside the nostrils of Darius's horse, who became excited at the smell and neighed. Immediately after, lightning and thunder occurred leading the other six noblemen to believe to be an [[act of God]], causing them to dismount and kneel before Darius.{{sfn|Poolos|2008|p=17}} Darius did not believe that he had achieved the throne through fraud but through brilliant sagacity, even erecting a statue of himself mounted on his neighing horse stating "Darius, son of Hystaspes, obtained the sovereignty of Persia by the sagacity of his horse and the ingenious contrivance of Oebases, his groom."{{sfn|Abbott|2009|p=98}}

According to the accounts of Greek historians, Cambyses II had left Patizeithes in charge of the kingdom when he headed for Egypt. He later sent Prexaspes to murder Bardiya. After the killing, Patizeithes put his brother Gaumata, a [[Magian]] who resembled Bardiya, on the throne and declared him the Great King. Otanes discovered that Gaumata was an impostor, and along with six other Iranian nobles including Darius, created a plan to oust the pseudo-Bardiya. After killing the impostor along with his brother Patizeithes and other Magians, Darius was crowned king the following morning.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1996|p=41}}

== Early reign ==
Following his coronation at [[Pasargadae]], Darius moved to Ecbatana. He soon learned that support for Bardiya was strong, and revolts in [[Elam]] and [[Babylonia]] had broken out. Darius ended the Elamite revolt when the revolutionary leader Aschina was captured and executed in [[Susa]], after three months the revolt in Babylonia had ended. While in Babylonia, Darius learned a revolution had broken out in [[Bactria]], a satrapy which had always been in favour of Darius, and had initially volunteered an army of soldiers to quell revolts. Following this, revolts broke out in [[Persis]], the homeland of the Persians and Darius. These new revolts led to a renewed revolt in Elam and Babylonia. With all these ongoing revolts, revolts broke out in [[Median Empire|Media]], [[Parthia]], [[Assyria]], and [[Egypt]]. By 522 BCE, the majority, if not the entire [[Achaemenid Empire]] was revolting against Darius and in turmoil. Even though Darius did not have the support of the [[populace]], Darius had a loyal army, led by close confidants and nobles (including the six nobles with whom he removed Gaumata) with whom he was able to suppress and quell all revolts within a year. In Darius's words, he had killed a total of eight "lying kings" through the quelling of revolutions. Darius left a detailed account of these revolutions at the [[Behistun Inscription]].

One of the significant events of Darius's early reign was the slaying of [[Intaphernes]]. Intaphernes was one of the seven noblemen who had deposed the previous ruler and installed Darius as the new monarch. The seven had made an agreement that they could all visit the new king whenever they pleased, except when he was with his wife. One evening, Intaphernes went to the palace to meet Darius, but was stopped by two officers who stated that Darius had retired for the night. Becoming enraged and insulted, Intaphernes drew his sword and cut off the ears and noses of the two officers. While leaving the palace, he took the [[bridle]] from his horse, and tied the two officers together. The officers went to the king and showed him what Intaphernes had done to them. Darius began to fear for his own safety; he thought that all seven noblemen had banded together to rebel against him and that the attack against his officers was the first sign of revolt. He sent a messenger to each of the noblemen, asking them if they approved of Intaphernes's actions; they denied it and disavowed any connection to Intaphernes's actions, stating that they stood by their decision to appoint Darius as King of Kings.

Taking precautions against further resistance, Darius sent soldiers to seize Intaphernes, along with his son, family members, relatives and any friends who were capable of arming themselves. Darius believed that Intaphernes was planning a rebellion, but when he was brought to the court, there was no proof of any such plan. Nonetheless, Darius killed Intaphernes's entire family, excluding his wife's brother and son. She was asked to choose between her brother and son. She chose her brother to live. Her reasoning for doing so was that she could have another husband and another son, but she would always have but one brother. Darius was impressed by her response and spared both her brother's and her son's life.{{sfn|Abbott|2009|p=99-101}}

== Military campaigns ==
After securing his authority over the [[Achaemenid Empire|entire empire]], Darius embarked on a campaign to [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] where he defeated the armies of the Pharaoh and secured the lands that Cambyses had conquered while incorporating a large portion of [[History of Achaemenid Egypt|Egypt into the Achaemenid Empire]]. Darius also led his armies to the [[Indus River]], building fortresses and establishing Persian rule.{{sfn|Del Testa|2001|p=47}}

=== Invasion of Indus Valley ===
[[File:Eastern border of the Achaemenid Empire.jpg|thumb|Eastern border of the [[Achaemenid Empire]].]]
{{see also|Iranian invasion of Indus Valley}}
In 516 BC, Darius embarked on a campaign to [[Central Asia]], [[Ariana|Aria]] and [[Bactria]] and then marched into [[Afghanistan]] to [[Taxila (satrapy)|Taxila Satrapy]] in modern [[Pakistan]]. Darius spent winter of 516-515 BC in [[Gandhara]], preparing to conquer the [[Indus River|Indus Valley]]. Darius conquered the Indus in 515 BC.<ref>[http://www.livius.org/da-dd/darius/darius_i_8.html Darius the Great]</ref> Darius I controlled the [[Indus River|Indus Valley]] from [[Gandhara]] to modern [[Karachi]] and appointed the Greek [[Scylax of Caryanda]] to explore the [[Indian Ocean]] from the mouth of the [[Indus]] to [[Suez]]. Darius then marched through the [[Bolan Pass]] and returned through [[Arachosia]] and [[Drangiana]] back to [[Persia]].

=== Babylonian revolt ===
[[File:Archers frieze Darius 1st Palace Suse Louvre AOD 488 a.jpg|Archers frieze from Darius's palace at Susa. Detail of the beginning of the frieze, left|200px|left|thumb]]
After [[Bardiya]] was murdered, widespread revolts occurred throughout [[Achaemenid Empire|the empire]], especially on the eastern side. Darius asserted his position as king by force, taking his armies throughout the empire, suppressing each revolt individually. The most notable of all the revolts is the Babylonian revolt which was led by [[Nebuchadnezzar III]]. This revolt occurred when Otanes withdrew much of the army from [[Babylon]] to aid Darius in suppressing other revolts. Darius felt that the Babylonian people had taken advantage of him and deceived him, which resulted in Darius gathering a large army and marching to [[Babylon]]. At Babylon, Darius was met with closed gates and a series of defenses to keep him and his armies out.{{sfn|Abott|2009|p=129}} Darius encountered mockery and taunting from the rebels, including the famous saying "Oh yes, you will capture our city, when mules shall have foals." For a year and a half, Darius and his armies were unable to retake the city, though he attempted many tricks and strategies<U+2014>even copying that which [[Cyrus the Great]] had employed when he captured Babylon. However, the situation changed in Darius's favor when, according to the story, a mule owned by [[Zopyrus]], a high-ranking soldier, foaled. Following this, a plan was hatched for [[Zopyrus]] to pretend to be a deserter, enter the Babylonian camp, and gain the trust of the Babylonians. The plan was successful, and Darius's army eventually surrounded the city and overcame the rebels.{{sfn|S<U+00E9>lincourt|2002|p=234-235}}

During this revolt, [[Scythian]] nomads took advantage of the disorder and chaos and invaded Persia. Darius first finished defeating the rebels in Elam, Assyria, and Babylon and then attacked the Scythian invaders. He pursued the invaders, who led him to a marsh; there he found no known enemies but an enigmatic Scythian tribe.{{sfn|Siliotti|2006|p=286-287}}

===Persian invasion of Scythia===
The Scythians were a group of north Iranian nomadic tribes, speaking an [[Indo-Iranian language]] who had invaded [[Median Empire|Media]], killed [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] in battle, revolted against Darius and threatened to disrupt trade between [[Central Asia]] and the shores of the [[Black Sea]] as they lived between the [[Danube]] river, river Don and the Black Sea.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1996|p=41}}{{sfn|Woolf|2004|p=686}}

Darius crossed the [[Black Sea]] at the [[Bosphorus|Bosphorus Straits]] using a bridge of boats. Darius conquered large portions of Eastern Europe - even crossing the Danube to wage war on the [[Scythians]]. Darius invaded [[Scythia]], where the Scythians evaded Darius's army, using feints and retreating technique eastward while wasting the countryside, by blocking wells, intercepting convoys, destroying pastures and continuous skirmishes against Darius's army.{{sfn|Ross|2004|p=291}} Seeking to fight with the Scythians, Darius's army chased the Scythian army deep into Scythian lands, where there were no cities to conquer and no supplies to forage. In frustration Darius sent a letter to the Scythian ruler [[Idanthyrsus]] to fight or surrender. The ruler replied that he would not stand and fight with Darius until they found the graves of their fathers and tried to destroy them - until then, they could continue their current technique as they had no cities or cultivated lands to lose.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=68-69}} Darius ordered a halt at the banks of [[Oarus]], where he built eight frontier fortresses spaced at intervals of eight miles. After chasing the Scythians for a month, Darius's army was suffering losses due to fatigue, privation and sickness. In fear of losing more troops, he halted the march at the banks of the [[Volga River]] and headed towards [[Thrace]].{{sfn|Chaliand|2004|p=16}} He had conquered enough territory of Scythia to force the Scythians to respect the Persian forces.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1996|p=45}}

=== Persian invasion of Greece ===
{{Main|First Persian invasion of Greece}}
[[File:Map Greco-Persian Wars-en.svg|thumb|Map showing key sites during the Persian invasions of Greece]]
Darius's European expedition was a major event in his reign, which began with the invasion of [[Thrace]], after which he left Megabyzus to conquer Thrace, returning to [[Sardis]] to spend the winter. Before returning, Darius also conquered many cities of the northern [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], while [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] submitted voluntarily. The Greeks living in Asia Minor and some of the Greek islands had submitted to Persian rule by 510 BCE. Nonetheless, there were certain Greeks who were pro-Persian, such as the medizing Greeks, which were largely grouped at [[Athens]]. This improved Greek-Persian relations as Darius opened his court and treasuries to the Greeks who wanted to serve him. These Greeks served as [[soldier]]s, [[artisan]]s, [[Politician|statesmen]] and [[sailor|mariners]] for Darius; however, Greek fear of the strength of Darius's kingdom became strong and the constant interference by the Greeks in [[Ionia]] and [[Lydia]] were all stepping stones in the conflict that was yet to come between Persia and Greece.

When Aristagoras organized the Ionian revolt, [[Eretria]] and Athens supported him by sending ships and troops to Ionia and burning [[Sardis]]. Persian military and naval operations to quell the revolt ended in the Persian reoccupation of Ionian and Greek islands; however, anti-Persian parties gained more power in Athens, and pro-Persian aristocrats were exiled from Athens and Sparta. Darius responded by sending troops led by his son-in-law across the Hellespont; however, a violent storm and harassment by Thracians forced the troops to return to Persia. Seeking revenge on Athens and Eretria, Darius assembled another army of 20,000 men under his Admiral, [[Datis]], and his nephew [[Artaphernes (son of Artaphernes)|Artaphernes]], who met success when he captured Eretria and advanced to Marathon. In 490 BCE, at the [[Battle of Marathon]], the Persian army was defeated by a heavily armed Athenian army, with 9,000 men who were supported by 600 [[Plataea]]ns, 1,000 soldiers from each of eleven [[Polis|Greek city-states]] (11,000 men in total) and 10,000 lightly armed soldiers led by [[Miltiades the Younger|Miltiades]].

The defeat at Marathon marked the end of the first Persian invasion of Greece. Darius began preparations for a second force which he would command, instead of his generals; however, before the preparations were complete, Darius died, thus leaving the task to his son [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]].{{sfn|Shahbazi|1996|p=45}}

== Family ==
Darius was son of Hystaspes and grandson of [[Arschama I|Arsames]], both men belonging to the [[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenid tribe]], and being alive when Darius ascended the throne. Darius justifies his ascension to the throne with his lineage tracing back to [[Achaemenes]], even though he was distantly related. For these reasons, Darius married [[Atossa]], daughter of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], with whom he had four sons, [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]], [[Achaimenes]], [[Masistes]] and Hystaspes. He also married [[Artystone]], another daughter of Cyrus, with whom he had two sons, [[Arsames]] and [[Gobryas]]. Darius also married [[Parmys]], the daughter of Bardiya, with whom he had a son, [[Ariomardos]]. Furthermore, Darius married [[Phratagone]], with whom he had two sons, [[Abrokomas]] and [[Hyperantes]]. He also married another woman of the nobility, [[Phaidime]], the daughter of [[Otanes]]. It is unknown if he had children with her. Before these royal marriages, Darius married a commoner with whom he had three sons, [[Artobarzanes]] (the first born), [[Ariabignes]] and [[Arsamenes]], while daughters are not known. Although Artobarzanes was the first born of Darius, Xerxes became heir and next king through the influence of Atossa, who had great authority in the kingdom, as Darius loved her, of all of his wives, most.

== Death ==
[[Image:The tomb of Darius I.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Darius the Great; located next to other Achaemenian kings at [[Naqsh-e Rustam]]]]

After becoming aware of the Persian defeat at the [[Battle of Marathon]], Darius began planning another expedition against the Greek-city states; this time, he, not Datis, would command the imperial armies.  Darius had spent three years preparing men and ships for war, when a revolt broke out in Egypt. This revolt in Egypt worsened his failing health and prevented the possibility of leading another army himself. Soon Darius died. In October 486 BCE the body of Darius was [[Embalming|embalmed]] and entombed in the rock-cut [[sepulcher]] which had been prepared for him several years earlier.

Xerxes, eldest son of Darius and [[Atossa]], succeeded to the throne as [[Xerxes I]]; however, prior to Xerxes's accession, he contested the succession with his elder half-brother Artobarzanes, Darius's eldest son who was born to his commoner first wife before Darius rose to power.{{sfn|Shahbazi}}

In 1923 German archaeologist [[Ernst Herzfeld]] made casts of the cuneiform inscriptions on Darius's tomb. They are currently housed in the archives of the [[Freer Gallery of Art]] and [[Arthur M. Sackler Museum]], Smithsonian Institution, [[Washington, DC]].

== Government ==

=== Organization ===
[[File:Darius-Vase.jpg|thumb|right|Darius I, imagined by a Greek painter, 4th century BCE]]
Early in his reign, Darius wanted to organize the loosely organized empire with a system of taxation he inherited from Cyrus and Cambyses. To do this, Darius created twenty provinces called [[satrapies]] (or ''archi'') which were each assigned to a [[satrap]] (''archon'') and specified fixed [[tribute]]s that the satrapies were required to pay. A complete list is preserved in the catalog of Herodotus, beginning from Ionia and listing the other satrapies from west to east excluding [[Persis]] which was the land of the Persians and the only province which was not a conquered land. Tributes were paid in both silver and gold talents.

Tributes in silver from each satrap were measured with the Babylonian [[Talent (measurement)|talent]]. Those paid in gold were measured with the [[Euboea|Euboic]] talent. The total tribute from the satraps came to an amount less than 15,000 silver talents.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1996|p=47}}

The majority of the satraps were of [[Persian people|Persian]] origin and were members of the royal house or the six great noble families. These satraps were personally picked by Darius to monitor these provinces, which were divided into sub-provinces with their own governors which were chosen either by the royal court or by the satrap. To assess tributes, a commission evaluated the expenses and revenues of each satrap. To ensure that one person did not gain too much power, each satrap had a secretary who observed the affairs of the state and communicated with Darius, a treasurer who safeguarded provincial revenues and a garrison commander who was responsible for the troops. Additionally, royal inspectors who were the "eyes and ears" of Darius completed further checks over each satrap.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1996|p=48}}

There were headquarters of imperial administration at Persepolis, Susa, and Babylon while Bactria, Ecbatana, Sardis, Dascyclium and Memphis also had branches of imperial administration. Darius chose [[Aramaic]] as a common language, which soon spread throughout the empire. However, Darius gathered a group of scholars to create a separate language system only used for Persis and the Persians, which was called Aryan script which was only used for official inscriptions.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1996|p=48}}

=== Economy ===
[[Image:Achaemenid coin daric 420BC front.jpg|thumb|right|Gold [[Persian daric|darics]] such as this one (with a purity of 95.83%) were only issued by the king himself. (c. 490 BCE).]]
Darius conducted the new introduction of a universal currency, the [[Persian daric|daric]] sometime before 500 BCE. Darius applied the coinage system as a transnational currency to regulate trade and commerce throughout his empire. The daric was also recognized beyond the borders of the empire - in places such as Celtic Central Europe and Eastern Europe. There were two types of darics, a gold and a silver. Only the king could mint gold darics, important generals and satraps minted silver darics, the latter usually to recruit Greek mercenaries in [[Anatolia]]. The daric was a major boost to international trade, trade goods such as [[textile]]s, [[carpet]]s, [[tool]]s and [[metalworking|metal objects]] began to travel throughout Asia, Europe and Africa. To further improve trade, Darius built a royal highway, a postal system and Phoenician-based commercial shipping.

The daric also improved government revenues as the introduction of the daric led to new taxes on land, livestock and marketplaces. This also led to the registration of land. It was measured and taxed accordingly. The increased government revenues helped maintain and improve existing [[infrastructure]]. The increased government revenues also helped fund [[irrigation]] projects in dry lands. This new tax system also led to the formation of state banking and the creation of banking firms. One of the most famous banking firms was [[Murashu and Sons]], based in [[Nippur]].{{sfn|Farrokh|2007|p=65}} These banking firms provided [[loan]]s and credit to clients.{{sfn|Farrokh|2007|p=65-66}}

The daric was called ''d<U+0101>rayaka'' [[Achaemenid Empire|within the empire]] and was most likely named after Darius. In an effort to further improve trade, Darius built canals, underground waterways and a powerful navy. He further improved and expanded the network of roads and waystations throughout the empire, so that there was a system of travel authorization for the King, satraps and other high officials, which entitled the traveller to draw provisions at daily stopping places.{{sfn|Verlag|2009|p=86}}{{sfn|Shahbazi|1996|p=48}}

=== Religion ===
{{quotebox|quote=By the grace of Ahuramazda am I king; Ahuramazda has granted me the [[Achaemenid Empire|kingdom]]. <U+2014> Darius, on the [[Behistun Inscription]]|width=30%}}
While there is no absolute consensus on the kings before Darius, such as [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] and [[Cambyses II of Persia|Cambyses]], it is well established that Darius was an adherent of [[Zoroastrianism]]{{sfn|Moulton|2005|p=48}} or at least a firm believer in [[Ahura Mazda]]. As can be seen at the [[Behistun Inscription]], Darius believed that [[Ahura Mazda]] had appointed him to rule the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. Darius had dualistic convictions and believed that each rebellion in his kingdom was the work of druj, the enemy of [[Asha]]. Darius believed that because he lived righteously by Asha, [[Ahura Mazda]] supported him.{{sfn|Boyce|1979|p=55}} In many [[cuneiform]] inscriptions denoting his achievements, he presents himself as a devout believer, perhaps even convinced that he had a divine right to rule over the world.{{sfn|Boyce|1979|p=54-55}}

In the lands that were conquered by his empire, Darius followed the same Achaemenid tolerance that [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] had shown and later Achaemenid [[emperor]]s would show. He supported faiths and religions that were "alien" as long as the adherents were submissive and peaceable, sometimes giving them grants from his treasury for their purposes.{{sfn|Boyce|1979|p=56}} He had funded the restoration of the [[Second Temple|Israelite temple]] which had originally been decreed by [[Cyrus the Great]], presented favour towards Greek cults which can be seen in his letter to [[Gadatas]], and supported Elamite priests. He had also observed Egyptian religious rites related to kingship and had built the temple for the Egyptian god, [[Amun]].{{sfn|Shahbazi|1996|p=49}}

=== Construction ===
[[Image:Persepolis 1.JPG|thumb|The ruins of Persepolis. In the foreground is the treasure house, right behind the Palace of Darius.]]
During [[First Persian invasion of Greece|Darius's Greek expedition]], he had begun construction projects in [[Susa]], [[History of Achaemenid Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Persepolis]]. He had linked the [[Red Sea]] to the river [[Nile]] by building a canal which ran from modern [[Zagazig|Zaq<U+0101>z<U+012B>q]] to modern [[Suez]]. To open this canal, he traveled to Egypt in 497 BCE, where the inauguration was done among great fanfare and celebration. Darius also built a canal to connect the [[Red Sea]] and [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].{{sfn|Shahbazi}}{{sfn|Spielvogel|2009|p=49}} On this visit to Egypt he erected monuments and executed [[Aryandes]] on accounts of treason. When Darius returned to Persis, he found that the codification of Egyptian law had been finished.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1996|p=45}}

Additionally, Darius sponsored large construction projects in Susa, [[Babylon]], Egypt, and Persepolis. In Susa, Darius built a new palace complex in the north of the city. An inscription states that the palace was destroyed during the reign of [[Artaxerxes I]], but was rebuilt. Today only glazed bricks of the palace remain, the majority of them in the [[Mus<U+00E9>e du Louvre|Louvre]]. In [[Pasargadae]] Darius finished all incomplete construction projects from the reign of [[Cyrus the Great]]. A palace was also built during the reign of Darius, with an inscription in the name of Cyrus the Great. It was previously believed that Cyrus had constructed this building, however due to the cuneiform script being used, the palace is believed to have been constructed by Darius.

In Egypt Darius built many temples and restored those that had previously been destroyed. Even though Darius was a Zoroastrian, he built temples dedicated to the Gods of the [[Ancient Egyptian religion]]. Several temples found were dedicated to [[Ptah]] and [[Nekhbet]]. Darius also created several roads and routes in Egypt. The monuments that Darius built were often inscribed in the official languages of the Persian Empire, [[Old Persian]], [[Elamite]] and [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]] and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. To construct these monuments Darius hired a large number of workers and artisans of diverse nationalities. Several of these workers were deportees who had been employed specifically for these projects. These deportees enhanced the economy and improved international relations with neighboring countries that these deportees arrived from.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1996|p=48}} At the time of Darius's death construction projects were still underway. Xerxes completed these works and in some cases expanded his father's projects by erecting new buildings of his own.{{sfn|Boardman|1988|p=76}}
