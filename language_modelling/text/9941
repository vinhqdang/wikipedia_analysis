'''Henrik Edward Larsson''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] [IPA: {{IPA|'h<U+025B>nr<U+026A>k 'l<U+0251><U+02D0><U+0282><U+0254>n}}] (born [[September 20]], [[1971]] in [[Helsingborg]], [[Sk<U+00E5>ne]]) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[football (soccer)|footballer]], best known for winning four titles in seven years with [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. He subsequently had a two-year spell at [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], where he won two titles and the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. After his contract had expired at Barcelona, Larsson returned to his home town club of [[Helsingborgs IF]], and joined [[Manchester United]] on a brief loan spell between January and March 2007.

Prior to his retirement from international football in 2006, Larsson had won 93 caps for [[Swedish National Football Team|Sweden]], scoring 36 goals.

==Playing career==
===Early career===
Larsson started his professional career playing for [[H<U+00F6>gaborgs BK|H<U+00F6>gaborg]] at the age of 17. He subsequently moved to [[Helsingborgs IF]], where he scored 50 goals in 56 appearances. It was this sensational form that attracted the interest of [[The Netherlands|Dutch]] club [[Feyenoord Rotterdam|Feyenoord]], who signed him for [[Pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]295,000 in 1993. This was despite the fact he was negotiating a contract with [[Grasshopper-Club Z<U+00FC>rich]] of Switzerland at the time.<ref name="1993-94: FEYENOORD AND THE 1994 WORLD CUP">{{cite web

===Celtic (1997-2004)===
Following a complicated contract dispute with Feyenoord,<sup>[specify]</sup> he was signed by Celtic manager [[Wim Jansen]] in July 1997 for a fee of <U+00A3>650,000. His debut against [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] at [[Easter Road]] was less than spectacular: he inadvertently passed the ball to Hibs player, [[Chic Charnley]] who then went on to score, resulting in a 2-1 loss for Celtic. He did not fare much better in his first European game, scoring an own goal, although Celtic did go on to win 6-3. Few would then have predicted that Larsson would go on to become one of the club's greatest ever players, popularly dubbed the 'King of Kings'; however, his performances improved markedly and Celtic went on to win the Scottish Premier League and League Cup in his first season, ending the run of consecutive titles by [[Old Firm]] rivals [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in the process.

During Celtic's 1-0 defeat in a UEFA Cup tie against [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]], Larsson suffered a career-threatening injury, breaking his leg in two places. This resulted in him spending eight months on the sidelines.

After recovering from this injury, and following the arrival of manager [[Martin O'Neill]] in 2000, Larsson and Celtic began to contest and win silverware on a more regular basis than during the 1990s. Celtic won the [[Scottish Premier League]] title in three of the subsequent four seasons, as well as two [[Scottish Cup]]s and a [[Scottish League Cup]]. In 2001 he won the "[[European Golden Boot|Golden Boot]]" award for being Europe's most prolific goal scorer, with 35 league goals. His total in all competitions that season was 53. In 2003, he scored two superb goals in the UEFA Cup Final, although opponents Porto went on to win [[UEFA Cup 2002-03#Final|3-2]]. His goalscoring feats on the continent for Celtic mean he holds the record for number of goals scored for a club from the British Isles in European matches. Celtic fans voted him the only foreigner in the greatest ever Celtic team.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/2245965.stm Jinky best-ever Celtic player] BBC Sport, [[2002-09-09]]. Retrieved [[2007-02-20]].</ref>

In his last appearance for Celtic, he scored two excellent goals (with either foot) to defeat Dunfermline Athletic and win the Scottish Cup. He gave a teary goodbye at his [[testimonial match]] against [[Sevilla FC]] in front of a capacity crowd at Celtic Park, Glasgow.

===Barcelona (2004-2006)===
[[Image:Larsson barca.jpg|thumb|150px|Warming up for Bar<U+00E7>a]]
At the end of the 2003-04 season Larsson left Celtic on a free transfer and signed a one year contract with [[F.C. Barcelona|Barcelona]] with an option for a second year.

Larsson's first season at Barcelona was plagued by injury, and he played only a nominal part in Bar<U+00E7>a's [[La Liga]] win. He did, however, score against Celtic in a [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] match. After the game he said "It was very difficult for me to celebrate my goal because I had so many great times here."<ref>Graham Clark, [http://football.guardian.co.uk/Match_Report/0,1527,1304856,00.html Larsson's return is unhappy for Celtic], [[Guardian Unlimited]], September 15, 2004</ref> Despite having missed most of the 2004-05 season, Barcelona took the option to extend his contract. In 2005-06 Larsson scored 10 goals as Barcelona won La Liga for a second consecutive year.
 
In January 2006, Larsson announced that at the end of his contract, which ended in July, he would leave Barcelona and return to Sweden to end his career. He revealed that he had politely refused a verbal promise by club president [[Joan Laporta]] to extend his contract to the end of the next season. News of his departure provoked praise from his teammates, including [[Ronaldinho]], who said, "With Henrik leaving us at the end of the season this club is losing a great scorer, no question. But I am also losing a great friend. Henrik was my idol and now that I am playing next to him it is fantastic."<ref>David Mccarthy, [http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/tm_objectid=16993621&method=full&siteid=66633&headline=ronnie--barca-pal-larsson-is-my-idol-name_page.html RONNIE: BARCA PAL LARSSON IS MY IDOL], ''DailyRecord'', April 26, 2006</ref>

In his final game for Barcelona, he won his first UEFA Champions League medal. Larsson came on as a substitute and assisted both of Barcelona's goals in a 2-1 win over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. [[Thierry Henry]] paid tribute to Larsson's contribution to Barcelona's win after the game, saying, "People always talk about Ronaldinho, [[Eto'o]], [[Ludovic Giuly|Giuly]] and everything, but I didn't see them today<U+2014>I saw Henrik Larsson. He came on<U+2014>he changed the game, that is what killed the game. Sometimes you talk about Ronaldinho and Eto'o and people like that; you need to talk about the proper footballer who made the difference, and that was Henrik Larsson tonight."<ref>{{cite web| last = Bailey| first = Graeme| url = http://home.skysports.com/list.asp?hlid=388106&CPID=5&clid=3&lid=4161&title=Henry+questions+referee| title = Henry questions referee|}} </ref>
Indeed his ability to give Barcelona the cutting edge required to overcome Arsenal was noted by the international press:<ref>Jon Brodkin, [http://football.guardian.co.uk/championsleague200506/story/0,,1777338,00.html Larsson takes his leave in the grandest style], [[Guardian Unlimited]], May 18, 2006</ref><ref>Simon Baskett, [http://in.rediff.com/sports/2006/may/18champs1.htm Barca inherit 'dream team' mantle], [[Reuters]], May 18, 2006</ref>

It was created with a flick of Henrik Larsson's right foot, a moment born of experience and craft. Larsson has said he is retiring from this level of soccer after this game. He had only just come on the field as a replacement but he knew exactly what he was doing. He has vision. He is 34 and he has been in the game for the whole of his adult life and what he could do once he could repeat another four minutes and Larsson again showed the ability to find the pass that destroys defenses. This time he spotted Juliano Belletti, another replacement, who with almost his first touch of the night powered the ball inside the near post of Arsenal's replacement goalkeeper, Manuel Almunia.

However, Larsson, a free transfer among an array of multi-million pound talent, was undoubtedly the difference between the sides. He set up the equalising goal with a delicate sidefooted pass to Samuel Eto'o, who took two touches before dinking the ball past Manuel Almunia.
Rijkaard hailed Larsson's role in the victory but said there was no chance of the Swede staying at Camp Nou for one more season. Larsson signed for Barcelona from Celtic in July, 2004.
"He is a wonderful player, and a very important player for us," said Rijkaard later. "He is always ready and prepared to come on and really help the team when we need him.
"We spoke to Henrik [about staying at Barcelona] but he has made his decision. He says now is the right time for him to go back home to Sweden."
Larsson preferred to concentrate on the effort shown by his team-mates.
"It was a tough match and the whole team deserve credit for the win," he said. "It was an unbelievable way for me to finish my career at Barcelona. I have had a fantastic experience here in my two years, with two league titles and now this. It's amazing."-->

===Helsingborgs IF (2006-present)===

After Sweden's elimination from the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] on [[June 24]] [[2006]], Larsson joined up with his former club, [[Helsingborgs IF]]. He made his second debut for his home town club against [[Hammarby IF|Hammarby]] in the [[Svenska Cupen|Swedish Cup]] on [[July 6]], [[2006]].

===Manchester United (loan spell 2007)=== 

Shortly after rejoining Helsingborgs IF, Larsson was signed on loan by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. United announced that Larsson would be on loan from [[January 1]] until [[March 12]] [[2007]], coinciding with the Swedish league's off season.<ref name="Man Utd capture Larsson on loan">{{cite news

Whilst United were eager to extend the loan deal, Larsson stated that he had made a promise to his family and his club to return on [[March 12]] 2007. This was confirmed on [[February 20]], when Larsson announced that he would not be extending his loan period.<ref name="Larsson snubs Man Utd extension">{{cite news

| accessdate = 2007-06-10}}</ref> Despite this, [[Sir Alex Ferguson]] was full of praise for the striker, saying 'He's been fantastic for us, we tried everything we could to get him to stay longer, but he made a promise and you have to respect that'. Larsson made his final appearance for United on Saturday [[10 March]], in a 6th Round FA Cup tie away to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], ending in a 2-2 draw.

==International career==
Larsson's international record is impressive with 36 goals in 93 games, many of which he played in midfield or as a winger. He has always made his mark on big occasions and has scored at three [[Football World Cup|World Cups]] ([[Football World Cup 1994|1994]] at which Sweden came third, [[Football World Cup 2002|2002]] and [[Football World Cup 2006|2006]]), and two [[European Football Championship|European Championships]] ([[2000 European Football Championship|2000]] and [[2004 European Football Championship|2004]]).

Larsson originally chose to retire from International football in [[2002]]. His decision was met with much dismay in his homeland and there was much clamouring for him to return to the team for their campaign at [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2004]] in [[Portugal]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/3525081.stm] Larsson rejects Sweden calls, Retrieved [[2007-06-01]].</ref>  Despite initially maintaining his decision to retire, he eventually returned to the national side at the behest of his son, and to great effect, scoring three goals in four matches and leading Sweden to the quarter-finals, where they were defeated in a [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]] by the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch]]. Larsson's tremendous diving header against Bulgaria was voted Best Goal of the 2004 European Championships.

Larsson also featured at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] in [[Germany]]. He scored in the final minute of the match against England for Sweden to draw the match 2-2 in their final game in the group stages, thus becoming only the sixth player to score in World Cup finals which are 12 years apart. The goal also sealed Sweden's qualification for the second round of the tournament. But in Sweden's Round of 16 game against host Germany, he blasted a penalty over the bar which could have given his team a lifeline after trailing 2-0 for most of the match.

He retired from international football for the second time on [[July 17]], [[2006]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/5189550.stm Larsson ends international career] BBC Sport, [[2006-07-17]] Retrieved [[2007-02-20]].</ref> "It is time to quit now. It feels right. I'm done with the national team," the 34-year-old Larsson told TV station Canal Plus. As of [[January 9]][[2007]] Sweden boss [[Lars Lagerb<U+00E4>ck]] is understood to be trying to lure him out of international retirement. Lagerb<U+00E4>ck is quoted as saying that the Swedish FA are eager to see him playing for his country once more.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/6245109.stm Sweden 'bid to lure back Larsson'] BBC Sport, Retrieved [[2007-06-01]].</ref>

==Personal life==
Henrik's father is from the [[Cape Verde]] Islands, off the coast of [[West Africa]], and his mother is Swedish. In 1996 he married his childhood sweetheart, Magdalena. They have two children, Jordan (born 1997) and Janelle (born 2002). 

Henrik still occasionally returns to Scotland to visit his long-time conditioning coach Dr Paul Bryson.

==Honours==
In November 2003, the [[Swedish Football Association]] bestowed upon him the accolade "[[UEFA Jubilee Awards|greatest Swedish football player of the last 50 years.]]" (to celebrate UEFA's Jubilee) In [[2005]] Larsson received an honorary degree from the [[University of Strathclyde]], in recognition of his contribution to football and for his charity work. In May 2006 he was given the honour of [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Consulate]] in Barcelona, in name of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] for his contributions to British football.<ref name="Striker Larsson to be given MBE">{{cite news
