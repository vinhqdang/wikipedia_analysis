'''William Cooley''' (1783&ndash;1863) was one of the first white [[settlers]] in modern day [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]] in [[Florida]], and a regional leader. He is primarily known because, in 1836, his family was murdered by [[Seminole]]s during the [[Second Seminole War]]. The attack, known as the "New River Massacre", caused immediate abandonment of the area.<ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1>{{cite journal

Cooley was born in Maryland, but little else is known about his life prior to 1813, when he arrived in [[East Florida]] as part of a military expedition. He first established himself as a farmer in the northern part of the territory before moving south, where he traded with local Indians and farmed. He sided with natives in a land dispute against a merchant who had received a large grant from the [[King of Spain]] and was evicting the Indians from their lands. These actions are believed to be the reason he moved to the New River area in 1826.<ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/>

In New River, Cooley sustained himself as a salvager and farmer, cultivating and milling arrowroot. His growing fortune and influence are outlined by the fact he became the first lawman and judge in the settlement, besides being a land appraiser. Local Indians perceived him as the person responsible for what they saw as a misjudgment involving the murder of one of their chiefs, and attacked the settlement in revenge on [[January 4]], [[1836]].<ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/>

Cooley survived the attack and lived for an additional {{nowrap|twenty seven years}}.  He held administrative positions in Dade County,<ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk2>{{cite journal

==New River settlement==
[[Image:William Cooley Map.png|300px|left|thumb|William Cooley timeline, mapped.]]Like the other New River settlers, Cooley did not buy land; he simply occupied the land in hope that the United States would eventually survey the area and grant ownership to the present settlers. The settlement was primarily populated by [[Bahamas|Bahamians]] that survived by [[Turtling (hunting)|turtling]], [[fishing]], [[shipbuilding]] and [[Wrecking (shipwreck)|wrecking]].<ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/>

Frankee Lewis&mdash;one of the first settlers, in the area since 1788<ref name=frankee>{{cite web|url=http://www.broward.org/history/timeline.htm|title=Broward Milestones|author=Broward County Historical Commission|accessdate=2007-06-23}}</ref>&mdash;sold her business interests to Richard Fitzpatrick in 1830. After his arrival, the settlement of approximately {{nowrap|70 people}} prospered with the introduction of a [[Plantation (settlement or colony)|plantation]] regimen based on [[Slavery in Colonial America#The first African slaves|black slavery]].<ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/>

Cooley's main occupation was gathering, processing and shipping [[arrowroot]], a starch made from the root of the [[coontie]] plant. Arrowroot was used to make bread dough, wafers and biscuits; its resistance to spoilage made it especially favored for use on ships. Pulp remaining after processing was used as a fertilizer or for animal rations. Favorable conditions for arrowroot cultivation contributed to the presence of several hundred Indians in the area&mdash;arrowroot was a staple of their diet.<ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/>

The market price for the starch was {{nowrap|between 8 and 16 cents per pound}} {{nowrap|(between 17 and 35 cents per kg)}}, and the geography of the river and the good performance of his machinery&mdash;the output was close to {{nowrap|450 lb per day (204 kg per day)}}&mdash;brought Cooley great prosperity. His good fortune allowed him to dedicate much of his time to exploration of the area (as far north as [[Lake Okeechobee]]) and increased political influence.<ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/> It is likely that he married Nancy Dayton, a former Indian captive, on [[December 2]], [[1830]].<ref name=MarrRecord>{{cite web|url=http://www.ancestry.com|quote=WILLIAM COOLEY/NANCY DAYTON/2 Dec 1830/Monroe/FL|title=

[[Image:Frankee Lewis Lands New River FL.PNG|thumb|Frankee Lewis lands, New River Settlement.]]

While trade and farming activities were prominent, wrecking was the most important economic activity in the settlement. Northern newspapers started a campaign against wrecking in 1832, stating that the activity was just a disguise for plain piracy; the {{nowrap|33% salvager's fee}} underscored their claim. Cooley, already in charge of overseeing wrecking, received a territorial appointment as [[appraiser]] of the sunk vessels and their cargoes. The [[hurricane]] seasons affected the activity, and the especially active [[1830-1839 Atlantic hurricane seasons#1835 Atlantic hurricane season|1835 season]] brought even bigger profits.<ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/>

By 1835, Cooley had a family of three children, two sons and one daughter. The boys were named Almonock and Montezuma after two
local Indian chiefs. His ten year old daughter and his nine year old son were tutored by the couple Mary E. Rigby and Joseph Flinton.<ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/>

He was appointed as an appraiser of property and slaves for Union Bank of Florida. His ally Richard Fitzpatrick purchased Cooley's coontie and [[citrus]] plantation on Miami River {{nowrap|for $2,500}}. Subsequently, Fitzpatrick was elected as representative for [[Monroe County, Florida|Monroe County]] to the [[Florida Legislature|Territorial Legislative Council]]. The unanimous vote for Fitzpatrick in New River was questioned by the ''Key West Inquirer''. Cooley's conduct was implicitly questioned as well, since as Justice of the Peace, Cooley conducted the non-secret [[ballot]]ing. In [[Key West, Florida|Key West]], Fitzpatrick lost to William Hackley.<ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/>

The Cooley property in New River had a house that was "{{nowrap|twenty feet}} by {{nowrap|fifty feet}} {{nowrap|(6 by 15 meters)}} , one story high, built of [[cypress]] logs, sealed and floored with {{nowrap|one and half inch (3.8 cm) planks}}".<ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/> At least three black slaves and several Indians cultivated sugar cane, corn, potatoes, pumpkins and other vegetables on the twenty&nbsp;acre property, which also had a pen with eighty hogs. The coontie [[watermill]] was twenty-seven by fourteen&nbsp;feet. {{nowrap|(8 by 4 meters)}} His Key West holdings included a factory, two storage houses, kitchen and slave quarters; coconut, lime and orange trees; and domesticated and wild fowl.<ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/>

==New River Massacre==
===Buildup===
{{seealso|Second Seminole War}}
[[Image:Wreckers Florida Keys.jpg|thumb|[[Florida Keys]] Wreckers]]Cooley maintained friendly relations and traded with the Seminole Indians in the area. In the early eighteenth century, [[Creek people|Creek Indians]] moved from Alabama and joined the Seminoles. In 1835, white settlers killed Creek chief Alibama and burned his hut in a dispute. As Justice of the Peace, Cooley jailed the settlers, but they were released after a hearing at the [[Monroe County]] Court in Key West due to insufficient evidence. The Creek people blamed Cooley, saying he withheld evidence. The growing uneasiness between the Creeks and the whites led to the Creeks' emigration to the Okeechobee area.<ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/>

[[Francis L. Dade|Major Francis L. Dade]], military commandant at Key West, received a lead that [[Cuba]] and [[Spain]] were arming the Indians; investigations did not confirm the rumour. Reports coming from [[Fort Brooke]] noted that Indians in the area were resisting orders from the federal government to emigrate to [[Mississippi]], contradicting the assertions made by the federal authorities that the Indians agreed to emigrate peacefully. Dade, two companies of soldiers and all the available arms were sent to Fort Brooke at
[[Tampa Bay]], the port designated for the trip west. The Indians answered by concentrating all their forces in the New River region.
On [[December 28]], [[1835]], Dade and 106&nbsp;soldiers were ambushed and killed en route from Tampa Bay to Fort King.<ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/>

===Attack===
[[Image:William Cooley Attack+Cleaned.png|thumb|Attack on New River Settlement in a contemporary rendition.]]
Six days later, Cooley led a large expedition to free the ''Gil Blas'', a ship that had beached the previous year. The scale of the operation required all of the settlement's able men. The next day, on [[4 January]] [[1836]], the Indians attacked the settlement.<ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/>

Fifteen to twenty Indians invaded the Cooley house, overpowering the tutor and [[scalping]] him. Cooley's wife tried to run to the river, but was shot about {{convert|170|yd|m|0}} from the house. The shot killed her and the infant son she was carrying. Cooley's nine year old son died from a fractured skull. The older girl was shot beside him.

The tutor's son heard the screams by the river and came back to retrieve his mother and two younger sisters. He managed to escape, going south by boat to the [[Cape Florida Light]]house. Along the way he warned the people at [[Arch Creek]] and [[Miami River]] of
the attack, prompting them to flee as well.<ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/>

===Aftermath===
{{seealso|Cape Florida Light}}
[[Image:Cape Florida 1830.jpg|thumb|Cape Florida Lighthouse c.1830|right]]
After the attack, the Indians torched the house and left without attacking other dwellings. The next day, Cooley came back to bury the dead; it is unclear who alerted the salvager's team to the attack.<ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/> After staying at the settlement for three days, Cooley went to the Cape Florida Lighthouse. One of the missing slaves showed up and reported that he knew the assailants and heard the Indians saying that the massacre was a response to the freeing of Alibama's murderers.<ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/>

Cooley took charge of the lighthouse encampment. Richard Fitzpatrick sent sixty slaves from his Miami plantation to the lighthouse.<ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk2/> Fearing more attacks and aware of the precarious safety of the [[lighthouse]], the settlers and slaves boarded Cooley's schooner and smaller boats and ran away to Indian Key, one hundred miles north of Key West.<ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk2/>

Cooley went back to New River and discovered the Indians had returned to loot the settlement and burn several other houses and plantations. A claim for restitution of his losses was denied in 1840 by the [[United States House of Representatives]].<ref name=congressclaim1>{{cite journal

==After New River==
[[Image:Indian key map.jpg|thumb|Indian Key c. 1840]]
Cooley resumed his life as a wrecker. Later that same year, he worked again as justice of the peace and assumed a position as a legislatively-appointed auctioneer.<ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk2/>

Constant attacks and rumor spreading amplified the demands of Floridian community leaders, forcing the [[Navy]] to send Lieutenant Levin M. Powell to Key West. Lieutenant Powell built a small force of {{nowrap|50 seamen}}, {{nowrap|95 marines}}, {{nowrap|8 officers}}, reinforced by {{nowrap|two schooners}} and the United States Cutter
''Washington'' commanded by Captain Day. He called Cooley to be his guide in the enterprise, due to his knowledge of Indian leaders and customs. Powell had mixed success, although by December 1836 the situation was under control at the coasts. Cooley went back to his usual duties in Indian Key ([[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]] Seat); not long after, he moved to Tampa,<ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk2/> but still worked occasionally as a guide.

General [[Thomas Jesup]], headquartered in Fort Dade, made Cooley an express rider in early 1837 to deliver messages between [[Tampa Bay]] and [[Middleburg, Florida#History|Fort Heilman]], a {{convert|170|mi|km|0}} corridor.<ref name=BrowardLegacyKnetch1/> That same year, reports circulated that Cooley was spreading rumors about a Seminole chief leading a rebellion involving black slaves and Indians. Afraid Cooley could be directly involved, the general had him interrogated. Afterwards, a disgusted Cooley resigned his position.<ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk2/>

Cooley befriended Captain William Bunce, a [[Retailing|retailer]] fighting to keep Indians in the area, as they represented a source of cheap labor. He became involved again in local politics, this time against General Jesup, who wanted to remove all Indians from Florida. Judge Steele, a newcomer from Connecticut, was with him in this fight.<ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk2/>
