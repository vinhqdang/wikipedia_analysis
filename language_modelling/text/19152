The '''Ford Mustang SSP''' was a lightweight [[Police vehicles in the United States|police car package]] based on the [[Ford Mustang]] produced between [[1982]]-[[1993]]. The car was meant to provide a speedier option for [[police]] departments in lieu of other full sized (and heavy) [[sedan]]s on the market at the time. The SSP abbreviates the designation '''[[Special Service Package]]''', a special [[Ford Fox platform|Foxbody Mustang]] trim made exclusively for law enforcement use. One of the taglines used by Ford to help sell this car was ''This Ford chases [[Porsche]]s for a living...''<ref>[http://www.sspmustang.org/features/82_CHP_Mustang.htm 1982 California Highway Patrol SSP Mustang (The First SSP Mustang)]</ref>

The units served a number of uses, and were often customized to suit each law enforcement agencies  particular needs. Law enforcement agencies from municipal to government agencies bought nearly 15,000 examples of these units. Many still exist today, either still in some role of law enforcement, from display cars to [[Drug Abuse Resistance Education|DARE]] cars, or in the hands of collectors and racers.  

==History==
In 1982, the [[California Highway Patrol]] asked the [[Ford Motor Company]] to produce a capable and lightweight police car due to the bulkiness of current police cars like the [[Ford Fairmont]] and [[Ford LTD|LTD]]/[[Ford Crown Victoria|Crown Victoria]] and the problems incurred with Chevrolet Camaros with their [[camshaft]]s<ref>[http://www.sspmustang.org/FAQ.htm SSP Mustang FAQ Page]</ref> and engine problems<ref>''Mustang Monthly'' "Highly Pursued" text and photos by Donald Farr, May 2006 pg 88-90</ref> at pursuit speeds. Taking the Fox 5.0 Mustangs in production at the time, Ford produced the Ford Mustang SSP (originally labelled '''Severe Service Package''', renamed in 1983 to [[Special Service Package]]) and modified them to suit the needs of the police and law enforcement departments. 

Nearly 15,000 of these special units were made from 1982 until their discontinuation in 1993 to over 60 law enforcement organizations and government agencies. Their roles ranged from general patrol to pursuit units, with some used in special duties like drug interdiction to academy training units. Several units were specially tasked to help land the [[Lockheed U2]] Spyplane. 

==Specifications==

The Mustang SSP was essentially a more rugged version of the 5.0 Mustang, with added features not available to the general public. According to the 1993 Mustang SSP brochure, available options included:

* Engine, 5.0&nbsp;L HO V8 with Sequential Multi-Port Injection 
* Forged pistons, roller cam (Hypereutectic pistons 1993) 
* Engine oil cooler 
* Aircraft-type silicone radiator hoses and clamps 
* 5-speed manual or 4-speed AOD transmission 
* Auto transmission fluid cooler 
* Brakes, power disc front/drum rear with rotor shields 
* Stainless steel factory headers 
* Dual exhaust system w/stainless tips 
* Fuel tank capacity <U+2014> 15.4 U.S. gallons (58&nbsp;L)
* Heavy duty stabilizer bars, front and rear 
* Full instrumentation with in-dash tachometer 
* 130&nbsp;amp heavy duty alternator 
* 2 Piece VASCAR speedometer cable 
* Certified calibrated speedometer 0-160&nbsp;mph 
* Non-operational courtesy lights (safety feature) 
* Steering wheel, leather wrapped 
* Relocated rear deck release 
* Single key locking doors/trunk 
* Reinforced floor pans 
* Full size spare tire 
* 15" X 7" cast aluminum wheels 

Depending on which agency bought them, extras like rollcages (requested by Oregon State Police) and power windows (requested by [[New York State Police]]) made each SSP unique to their respective departments. The original configuration of the civilian Mustang with its small rear seat and manual transmission were generally considered ill-suited for a law-enforcement vehicle. A number of Mustang SSP's were of the automatic transmission to free an officers hand from using the manual transmission stick so that he could use the hand for other duties, such as speaking on a radio or grabbing his sidearm.  

Virtually all of the 15,000 Mustang SSP's were of the coupe or "notchback" style cars; 5 examples made for the California Highway Patrol in 1982 were of the hatchback model.

==Disposition==

Many of the Mustang SSPs have been retired from service, with a few examples still on the rosters of police departments as display or [[Drug Abuse Resistance Education|DARE]] cars. A few law enforcement agencies still keep them on active duty. Most examples have found their way into either racing or restoration. 

With its stiffened frame and beefed up suspension, many Mustang SSPs were modified for use in [[Drag Racing]]. The plentiful aftermarket of parts for the 5.0 Engine made the SSP platform a desirable frame to work on, but with the dwindling supply and rising prices of genuine Mustang SSPs, these factors have limited racers from converting SSPs for racing purposes.    

Restoring Mustang SSPs have become a growing hobby as of late, with car clubs and websites devoted to the restoration of the law enforcement workhorse. Most enthusiasts strive for accuracy in their models, with many scouring for [[OEM]] parts, incuding police radios, shotgun holders, lights, sirens, and other related equipment. However, the hobby is limited, as many states have regulations on private citizens owning cars that could be mistaken for real cop cars. Some get around the regulations by using magnetic decals and removeable lights.

==Distinct models==
===CHP Hatchback===

Out of the initial batch of 400 units for the CHP, five were of the "hatchback" variety. It's generally assumed by SSP experts that these were not SSP models, and no clear consensus has determined why these were made. One exists in private hands.

===CHP EVOC===

Several Mustang SSPs were heavily modified and used as training units at CHP's EVOC facility.<ref>[http://www.sspmustang.org/features/chp_evoc_vehicle.htm 1992 CHP Mustang EVOC vehicle]</ref> <ref> [http://www.sspmustang.org/photos/smf_photo3f.htm sspmustang.org State/Municipal/Federal SSP Mustangs gallery; 2 EVOC cars (92 on left/89 right) at the CHP academy; note hubcaps removed for safety]</ref>

===USAF U2 chase car===
[[Image:Mobile 9970 from 9971 Alconbury.jpg|thumb|300pix|right|Two SSP Mustang Units chasing a U2 Spy Plane on the tarmac at RAF Alconbury.]] 
Due to problems with landing the [[Lockheed U2]], a system was implemented where a second pilot would chase the U2 (termed "mobile") and help guide the U2 down to earth. The [[United States Air Force|USAF]] usually utilized a performance car for this task.

In 1986, the USAF was looking for a replacement for the [[Chevrolet El Camino]] as a chase car for the U2. [[Beale Air Force Base]] asked the local [[California Highway Patrol]] to provide a Mustang SSP for testing. The test proved the Mustang SSP superior to the El Camino and the USAF ordered 20 for work with the U2 spyplanes. 

Their career lasted until the late 1990s, when they were replaced by [[Chevrolet Camaro]]s. 

One of three examples from [[RAF Alconbury]] is preserved: 1988 Mustang SSP 88B 9971 "Mobile 1", serving with the 17th Reconnaissance Wing and the 95th Reconnaissance Squadron until its disposal in 1999. It is currently in the hands of a private collector in the United States after being ferried from its last operation in Italy to England.<ref>[http://www.sspmustang.org/features/USAF_SSP.htm A look at USAF 'Spy Plane Chasers']</ref>

==Saleen connections==

Noted Mustang tuner [[Saleen]] contributed to the history of the Mustang SSP. The Oregon State Police had ordered 34 coupes in [[1988]], but cancelled the order at the last minute. The dealership that ordered the coupes scrambled to find a way to get rid of the order, and Saleen took custody of 13 of the cars. Saleen retuned the cars, and also added vehicle ID, rear spoiler, ground effects and interior upgrades. The firm then resold them, tuned for private use.<ref>[http://www.sspmustang.org/FAQ.htm SSP Mustang FAQ Page]</ref>

While not considered a true SSP, Saleen modified another 5.0, a 1990 5.0 LX Hatchback, this time for the [[Seal Beach, California]] Police Department. Designated as a S442 model, this model served Seal Beach until its retirement in the late 1990s.<ref>''Mustang Forty Years'', by Randy Leffingwell, ISBN 0-7603-1597-3</ref>

==SSP in popular culture==

One restored Mustang SSP appeared in the film [[Friday Night Lights]].<ref>[http://www.sspmustang.org/features/movie_write_up.htm Behind the scences of Friday Night Lights]</ref>  The usage of the SSP was to keep within a reasonable time period to set the atmosphere of the film. 

While it is unclear if the models were regular LX or 5.0 models with police paint and markings, or true Mustang SSPs, several foxbody mustangs were used (and a few crashed) in the film '''Gone in 60 Seconds 2''' produced by the late [[H.B 'Toby' Halicki]].
