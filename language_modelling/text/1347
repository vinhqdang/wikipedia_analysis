The term "poliomyelitis" is used to identify the disease caused by any of the three [[Serovar|serotypes]] of poliovirus. Two basic patterns of polio infection are described: a minor illness which does not involve the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), sometimes called abortive poliomyelitis, and a major illness involving the CNS, which may be paralytic or nonparalytic.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Falconer M, Bollenbach E |title=Late functional loss in nonparalytic polio |journal=American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation / Association of Academic Physiatrists |volume=79 |issue=1 |pages=19<U+2013>23 |year=2000 |pmid=10678598 |doi=10.1097/00002060-200001000-00006}}</ref> In most people with a [[immunocompetent|normal immune system]], a poliovirus infection is [[Subclinical infection|asymptomatic]]. Rarely, the infection produces minor symptoms; these may include upper [[respiratory tract]] infection ([[Pharyngitis|sore throat]] and fever), [[gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] disturbances (nausea, vomiting, [[abdominal pain]], constipation or, rarely, diarrhea), and [[influenza-like illness]].<ref name= PinkBook/>

The virus enters the central nervous system in about 3% of infections. Most patients with CNS involvement develop nonparalytic [[aseptic meningitis]], with symptoms of headache, neck, back, abdominal and extremity pain, fever, vomiting, [[lethargy]], and irritability.<ref name=Chamberlin_2005 /><ref name=Late>{{cite book | author=Leboeuf C | title=The late effects of Polio: Information For Health Care Providers. | url = http://www.health.qld.gov.au/polio/gp/GP_Manual.pdf| format=PDF | publisher=Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health |year = 1992 |isbn=1-875412-05-0| accessdate=2008-08-23|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080625212726/http://www.health.qld.gov.au/polio/gp/GP_Manual.pdf |archivedate = June 25, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> About one to five in 1000 cases progress to [[paralytic]] disease, in which the muscles become weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and, finally, completely paralyzed; this condition is known as [[Flaccid paralysis|acute flaccid paralysis]].<ref name=Henry1 />  Depending on the site of paralysis, paralytic poliomyelitis is classified as spinal, bulbar, or bulbospinal. [[Encephalitis]], an infection of the brain tissue itself, can occur in rare cases, and is usually restricted to infants. It is characterized by confusion, changes in mental status, headaches, fever, and, less commonly, [[seizure]]s and [[spastic paralysis]].<ref name= Encephalitis>{{cite book |author=Wood, Lawrence D.

[[File:Polio EM PHIL 1875 lores.PNG|thumb|right|A [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]] [[micrograph]] of poliovirus]]

Poliomyelitis is caused by infection with a member of the [[genus]] ''[[Enterovirus]]'' known as [[poliovirus]] (PV). This group of [[RNA virus]]es colonize the [[gastrointestinal tract]]<ref name=Harrison /> <U+2014> specifically the [[oropharynx]] and the [[intestine]]. The incubation time (to the first signs and symptoms) ranges from three to 35 days, with a more common span of six to 20 days.<ref name=PinkBook/> PV [[pathogen|infects and causes disease]] in humans alone.<ref name=Sherris /> Its [[Virus structure|structure]] is very simple, composed of a single [[sense (molecular biology)|(+) sense]] [[RNA]] [[genome]] enclosed in a protein shell called a [[capsid]].<ref name=Sherris /> In addition to protecting the virus<U+2019>s genetic material, the capsid proteins enable poliovirus to infect certain types of cells. Three [[serovar|serotypes]] of poliovirus have been identified<U+2014>poliovirus type 1 (PV1), type 2 (PV2), and type 3 (PV3)<U+2014>each with a slightly different capsid protein.<ref>{{cite book |author=Katz, Samuel L.; Gershon, Anne A.; Krugman, Saul; Hotez, Peter J. |title=Krugman's infectious diseases of children |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2004 |pages=81<U+2013>97 |isbn=0-323-01756-8 }}</ref> All three are extremely [[virulence|virulent]] and produce the same disease symptoms.<ref name=Sherris /> PV1 is the most commonly encountered form, and the one most closely associated with paralysis.<ref name= Ohri/>

Individuals who are exposed to the virus, either through infection or by [[immunization]] with polio vaccine, develop [[immunity (medical)|immunity]].  In immune individuals, [[IgA]] [[antibodies]] against poliovirus are present in the [[tonsil]]s and gastrointestinal tract, and are able to block virus replication; [[IgG]] and [[IgM]] antibodies against PV can prevent the spread of the virus to motor neurons of the [[central nervous system]].<ref name=Kew_2005/> Infection or vaccination with one serotype of poliovirus does not provide immunity against the other serotypes, and full immunity requires exposure to each serotype.<ref name=Kew_2005/>

A rare condition with a similar presentation, nonpoliovirus poliomyelitis, may result from infections with nonpoliovirus [[enterovirus]]es.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gorson KC, Ropper AH |title=Nonpoliovirus poliomyelitis simulating Guillain-Barr<U+00E9> syndrome |journal=Archives of Neurology |volume=58 |issue=9 |pages=1460<U+2013>4 |year=2001 |month=September |pmid=11559319 |doi= 10.1001/archneur.58.9.1460|url=http://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11559319}}</ref>

=== Paralytic polio ===
[[File:PHIL 2767 Poliovirus Myotonic dystrophic changes.jpg|thumb|right|Denervation of [[skeletal muscle]] tissue secondary to poliovirus infection can lead to paralysis.]]

In around 1% of infections, poliovirus spreads along certain nerve fiber pathways, preferentially replicating in and destroying [[motor neuron]]s within the [[spinal cord]], [[brain stem]], or [[motor cortex]]. This leads to the development of paralytic poliomyelitis, the various forms of which (spinal, bulbar, and bulbospinal) vary only with the amount of neuronal damage and inflammation that occurs, and the region of the CNS affected.

The destruction of neuronal cells produces [[lesion]]s within the [[Dorsal root ganglion|spinal ganglia]]; these may also occur in the [[reticular formation]], [[vestibular nuclei]], [[cerebellar vermis]], and deep [[cerebellar nuclei]].<ref name=Mueller />  Inflammation associated with [[Neuron|nerve cell]] destruction often alters the color and appearance of the gray matter in the [[spinal column]], causing it to appear reddish and swollen.<ref name=Chamberlin_2005/> Other destructive changes associated with paralytic disease occur in the [[forebrain]] region, specifically the [[hypothalamus]] and [[thalamus]].<ref name=Mueller /> The molecular mechanisms by which poliovirus causes paralytic disease are poorly understood.

Early symptoms of paralytic polio include high fever, headache, stiffness in the back and neck, asymmetrical weakness of various muscles, sensitivity to touch, [[Dysphagia|difficulty swallowing]], [[Myalgia|muscle pain]], loss of superficial and deep [[reflex]]es, [[paresthesia]] (pins and needles), irritability, constipation, or difficulty urinating. Paralysis generally develops one to ten days after early symptoms begin, progresses for two to three days, and is usually complete by the time the fever breaks.<ref name= Silverstein>{{cite book |author = Silverstein A, Silverstein V, Nunn LS |title=Polio | series = Diseases and People |  publisher=Enslow Publishers |location=Berkeley Heights, NJ |year=2001| isbn=0-7660-1592-0 |page= 12 }}</ref>

The likelihood of developing paralytic polio increases with age, as does the extent of paralysis.

==== Spinal polio ====
[[File:Polio spinal diagram.PNG|thumb|left|The location of [[motor neuron]]s in the [[Anterior horn (spinal cord)|anterior horn cells]] of the [[spinal column]]]]

Spinal polio, the most common form of paralytic poliomyelitis, results from viral invasion of the motor neurons of the [[Anterior horn (spinal cord)|anterior horn cells]], or the [[ventral]] (front) [[grey matter]] section in the [[spinal column]], which are responsible for movement of the muscles, including those of the [[torso|trunk]], [[limb (anatomy)|limbs]], and the [[intercostal muscle]]s.<ref name= Henry1>{{cite book | author = Frauenthal HWA, Manning JVV | title = Manual of infantile paralysis, with modern methods of treatment.| publisher = Philadelphia Davis | year = 1914| pages= 79<U+2013>101 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=piyLQnuT-1YC&printsec=titlepage | oclc=  2078290}}</ref> Virus invasion causes inflammation of the nerve cells, leading to damage or destruction of motor neuron [[ganglion|ganglia]].

==== Bulbar polio ====
[[File:Brain bulbar region.svg|thumb|right|The location and anatomy of the bulbar region (in orange)]]

Making up about 2% of cases of paralytic polio, bulbar polio occurs when poliovirus invades and destroys nerves within the [[bulbar]] region of the [[brain stem]].<ref name = PinkBook /> The bulbar region is a [[white matter]] pathway that connects the [[cerebral cortex]] to the brain stem. The destruction of these nerves weakens the muscles supplied by the [[cranial nerve]]s, producing symptoms of [[encephalitis]], and causes [[Dyspnea|difficulty breathing]], speaking and swallowing.<ref name=Late /> Critical nerves affected are the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] (which partially controls swallowing and functions in the throat, tongue movement, and taste), the [[vagus nerve]] (which sends signals to the heart, intestines, and lungs), and the [[accessory nerve]] (which controls upper neck movement). Due to the effect on swallowing, secretions of [[mucus]] may build up in the airway, causing suffocation.<ref name = Silverstein /> Other signs and symptoms include [[facial weakness]] (caused by destruction of the [[trigeminal nerve]] and [[facial nerve]], which innervate the cheeks, [[tear duct]]s, gums, and muscles of the face, among other structures), [[diplopia|double vision]], difficulty in chewing, and abnormal [[respiratory rate]], depth, and rhythm (which may lead to [[respiratory arrest]]). [[Pulmonary edema]] and [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] are also possible and may be fatal.<ref name=Guide/>

==== Bulbospinal polio ====
Approximately 19% of all paralytic polio cases have both bulbar and spinal symptoms; this subtype is called respiratory or bulbospinal polio.<ref name= PinkBook /> Here, the virus affects the upper part of the cervical spinal cord ([[cervical vertebrae]] C3 through C5), and paralysis of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] occurs. The critical nerves affected are the [[phrenic nerve]] (which drives the diaphragm to inflate the [[human lung|lungs]]) and those that drive the muscles needed for swallowing. By destroying these nerves, this form of polio affects breathing, making it difficult or impossible for the patient to breathe without the support of a [[medical ventilator|ventilator]]. It can lead to paralysis of the arms and legs and may also affect swallowing and heart functions.<ref name= Hoyt/>

== Diagnosis ==
Paralytic poliomyelitis may be clinically suspected in individuals experiencing acute onset of flaccid paralysis in one or more limbs with decreased or absent tendon reflexes in the affected limbs that cannot be attributed to another apparent cause, and without sensory or [[cognitive]] loss.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Case definitions for infectious conditions under public health surveillance. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |url= ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Publications/mmwr/rr/rr4610.pdf |format=PDF|journal= Morbidity and mortality weekly report |volume=46 |issue=RR<U+2013>10 |pages=26<U+2013>7 |year=1997 |pmid=9148133 }}</ref>

A laboratory diagnosis is usually made based on recovery of poliovirus from a stool sample or a swab of the [[human pharynx|pharynx]]. [[antibody|Antibodies]] to poliovirus can be diagnostic, and are generally detected in the blood of infected patients early in the course of infection.<ref name=PinkBook /> Analysis of the patient's [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF), which is collected by a [[lumbar puncture]] ("spinal tap"), reveals an increased number of [[white blood cell]]s (primarily [[lymphocyte]]s) and a mildly elevated protein level. Detection of virus in the CSF is diagnostic of paralytic polio, but rarely occurs.<ref name = PinkBook/>

If poliovirus is isolated from a patient experiencing acute flaccid paralysis, it is further tested through [[oligonucleotide]] mapping ([[genetic fingerprint]]ing), or more recently by [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] amplification, to determine whether it is "[[wild type]]" (that is, the virus encountered in nature) or "vaccine type" (derived from a strain of poliovirus used to produce polio vaccine).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chezzi C |title=Rapid diagnosis of poliovirus infection by PCR amplification |pmc=229102 | journal=[[Journal of Clinical Microbiology|J Clin Microbiol]] |volume=34 |issue=7 |pages=1722<U+2013>5 |pmid=8784577 |year=1996 | month=July}}</ref>  It is important to determine the source of the virus because for each reported case of paralytic polio caused by wild poliovirus, an estimated 200 to 3,000  other contagious [[asymptomatic carrier]]s exist.<ref>{{cite journal |authorlink = Atul Gawande |author= Gawande A  |title = The mop-up: eradicating polio from the planet, one child at a time | work = [[The New Yorker]] | issn = 0028-792X | pages = 34<U+2013>40 | date = 2004-01-12}}</ref>

== Prevention ==

=== Passive immunization ===
In 1950, [[William Hammon]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] purified the [[gamma globulin]] component of the [[blood plasma]] of polio survivors.<ref name=Hammon_1955>{{cite journal |author=Hammon W |title=Passive immunization against poliomyelitis |journal=Monogr Ser World Health Organ |volume=26 |issue= |pages=357<U+2013>70 |year = 1955 |pmid=14374581}}</ref>  Hammon proposed the gamma globulin, which contained antibodies to poliovirus, could be used to halt poliovirus infection, prevent disease, and reduce the severity of disease in other patients who had contracted polio. The results of a large [[clinical trial]] were promising; the gamma globulin was shown to be about 80% effective in preventing the development of paralytic poliomyelitis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hammon W, Coriell L, Ludwig E, ''et al.'' |title=Evaluation of Red Cross gamma globulin as a prophylactic agent for poliomyelitis. 5.

=== Vaccine ===
{{main|Polio vaccine}}
[[File:Poliodrops.jpg|thumb|right|A child receiving an oral polio vaccine]]

Two types of vaccine are used throughout the world to combat polio. Both types induce immunity to polio, efficiently blocking person-to-person transmission of wild poliovirus, thereby protecting both individual vaccine recipients and the wider community (so-called [[herd immunity]]).<ref name=Fine>{{cite journal |author=Fine P, Carneiro I |title=Transmissibility and persistence of oral polio vaccine viruses: implications for the global poliomyelitis eradication initiative |url= http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/150/10/1001| journal=Am J Epidemiol |volume=150 |issue=10 |pages=1001<U+2013>21 |date=15 November 1999|pmid=10568615 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a009924 }}</ref>

The first candidate [[polio vaccine]], based on one serotype of a live but [[attenuated vaccine|attenuated (weakened) virus]], was developed by the [[virologist]] [[Hilary Koprowski]].

== Treatment ==
There is no [[cure]] for polio. The focus of modern treatment has been on providing relief of symptoms, speeding recovery and preventing complications. Supportive measures include [[antibiotics]] to prevent infections in weakened muscles, [[analgesics]] for pain, moderate exercise and a nutritious diet.<ref name=Daniel>{{cite book |author=Daniel, Thomas M.; Robbins, Frederick C. |title=Polio |publisher=University of Rochester Press |location=Rochester, N.Y., USA |year= 1997 |pages= 8<U+2013>10 |isbn=1-58046-066-6 }}</ref> Treatment of polio often requires long-term rehabilitation, including [[occupational therapy]], [[physical therapy]], braces, corrective shoes and, in some cases, [[orthopedic surgery]].<ref name=Guide />

Portable [[ventilator]]s may be required to support breathing. Historically, a noninvasive, negative-pressure ventilator, more commonly called an [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]], was used to artificially maintain respiration during an acute polio infection until a person could breathe independently (generally about one to two weeks). Today, many polio survivors with permanent respiratory paralysis use modern [[Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation|jacket-type]] negative-pressure ventilators worn over the chest and abdomen.<ref name= Goldberg />

Other [[History of poliomyelitis#Historical treatments|historical treatments for polio]] include [[hydrotherapy]], [[electrotherapy]], massage and passive motion exercises, and surgical treatments, such as tendon lengthening and nerve grafting.<ref name=Henry1 />

== Prognosis ==
Patients with abortive polio infections recover completely. In those who develop only aseptic meningitis, the symptoms can be expected to persist for two to ten days, followed by complete recovery.<ref name=Neumann/> In cases of spinal polio, if the affected nerve cells are completely destroyed, paralysis will be permanent; cells that are not destroyed, but lose function temporarily, may recover within four to six weeks after onset.<ref name=Neumann>{{cite journal |author=Neumann D |title=Polio: its impact on the people of the United States and the emerging profession of physical therapy |url= http://www.post-polio.org/edu/hpros/Aug04HistPersNeumann.pdf | format = PDF | journal=The Journal of orthopaedic and sports physical therapy |volume=34 |issue=8 |pages=479<U+2013>92 |year=2004 |pmid=15373011}} Reproduced online with permission by Post-Polio Health International; retrieved on 2007-11-10.</ref> Half the patients with spinal polio recover fully; one-quarter recover with mild disability, and the remaining quarter are left with severe disability.<ref>{{cite book |author=Cuccurullo SJ |title=Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Board Review |url= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?&rid=physmedrehab.table.8357 | publisher=Demos Medical Publishing | year = 2004  |isbn=1-888799-45-5}}</ref> The degree of both acute paralysis and residual paralysis is likely to be proportional to the degree of [[viremia]], and [[inversely proportional]] to the degree of [[immunity (medical)|immunity]].<ref name= Mueller/> Spinal polio is rarely fatal.<ref name=Silverstein />

=== Recovery ===
Many cases of poliomyelitis result in only temporary paralysis.<ref name=Henry1 /> Nerve impulses return to the formerly paralyzed muscle within a month, and recovery is usually complete in six to eight months.<ref name=Neumann /> The [[neurophysiology|neurophysiological]] processes involved in recovery following acute paralytic poliomyelitis are quite effective; muscles are able to retain normal strength even if half the original motor neurons have been lost.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sandberg A, Hansson B, St<U+00E5>lberg E |title=Comparison between concentric needle EMG and macro EMG in patients with a history of polio |journal=Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=110 |issue=11 |pages=1900<U+2013>8 |year=1999 |pmid=10576485 |doi=10.1016/S1388-2457(99)00150-9}}</ref> Paralysis remaining after one year is likely to be permanent, although modest recoveries of muscle strength are possible 12 to 18 months after infection.<ref name=Neumann />

One mechanism involved in recovery is nerve terminal sprouting, in which remaining brainstem and spinal cord motor neurons develop new branches, or axonal sprouts.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cashman NR, Covault J, Wollman RL, Sanes JR |title=Neural cell adhesion molecule in normal, denervated, and myopathic human muscle |journal=Ann.

In addition to these physiological processes, the body possesses a number of compensatory mechanisms to maintain function in the presence of residual paralysis. These include the use of weaker muscles at a higher than usual intensity relative to the [[Muscle contraction#Contractions, by muscle type|muscle's maximal capacity]], enhancing athletic development of previously little-used muscles, and using [[ligament]]s for stability, which enables greater mobility.<ref name = Grimby_1989 />

=== Complications ===
Residual complications of paralytic polio often occur following the initial recovery process.<ref name= Late /> Muscle [[paresis]] and paralysis can sometimes result in [[skeletal]] deformities, tightening of the joints and movement disability. Once the muscles in the limb become flaccid, they may interfere with the function of other muscles. A typical manifestation of this problem is [[equinus foot]] (similar to [[club foot]]). This deformity develops when the muscles that pull the toes downward are working, but those that pull it upward are not, and the foot naturally tends to drop toward the ground. If the problem is left untreated, the [[Achilles tendon]]s at the back of the foot retract and the foot cannot take on a normal position. Polio victims that develop equinus foot cannot walk properly because they cannot put their heel on the ground. A similar situation can develop if the arms become paralyzed.<ref name= Aftereffects>{{cite web | author = Sanofi Pasteur | title = Poliomyelitis virus (picornavirus, enterovirus), after-effects of the polio, paralysis, deformations | work = Polio Eradication | url = http://www.polio.info/polio-eradication/front/index.jsp?siteCode=POLIO&lang=EN&codeRubrique=14 | accessdate = 2008-08-23|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071007100336/http://www.polio.info/polio-eradication/front/index.jsp?siteCode=POLIO&lang=EN&codeRubrique=14 |archivedate = October 7, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> In some cases the growth of an affected leg is slowed by polio, while the other leg continues to grow normally.

An intervention to prevent or lessen length disparity can be to perform an [[epiphysiodesis]] on the distal femoral and proximal tibial/fibular condyles, so that limb's growth is artificially stunted, and by the time of [[epiphyseal plate|epiphyseal (growth) plate]] closure, the legs are more equal in length.

While now rare in the Western world, polio is still endemic to South Asia and Africa, particularly Pakistan, and Nigeria respectively. Following the widespread use of poliovirus vaccine in the mid-1950s, the incidence of poliomyelitis declined dramatically in many industrialized countries.

The disease was very well publicized during the polio epidemics of the 1950s, with extensive media coverage of any scientific advancements that might lead to a cure. Thus, the scientists working on polio became some of the most famous of the century. Fifteen scientists and two laymen who made important contributions to the knowledge and treatment of poliomyelitis are honored by the [[Polio Hall of Fame]], which was dedicated in 1957 at the [[Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation]] in [[Warm Springs, Georgia]], US. In 2008 four organizations (Rotary International, the World Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and UNICEF) were added to the Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite news | first=Winston | last=Skinner | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Four added to Polio Hall of Fame at Warm Springs | date=2008-11-15 | publisher= | url =http://www.times-herald.com/Local/Four-added-to-Polio-Hall-of-Fame-at-Warm-Springs-589785 | work =The Times-Herald (Newnan, GA) | pages = | accessdate = 2009-05-29 | language = }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=CDC Inducted into Polio Hall of Fame | date=2009-01-23 | publisher= | url =http://www.cdc.gov/news/2009/01/polio_hof/ | work =CDC In the News | pages = | accessdate = | language = }}</ref>

World Polio Day (October 24) was established by [[Rotary International]] to commemorate the birth of [[Jonas Salk]], who led the first team to develop a vaccine against poliomyelitis. Use of this inactivated poliovirus vaccine and subsequent widespread use of the oral poliovirus vaccine developed by [[Albert Sabin]] led to establishment of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) in 1988. Since then, GPEI has reduced polio worldwide by 99%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6141a6.htm |title=Announcement: World Polio Day <U+2014> October 24, 2012 |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=19 October 2012 |website=CDC |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=December 7, 2013}}</ref>
