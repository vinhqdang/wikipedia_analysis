'''John Henry Foster Babcock''' (born [[July 23]], [[1900]]) is, at age 107, the last known surviving veteran of the [[Canada|Canadian]] military to have served in [[World War I|the First World War]]. Babcock first attempted to join the army at the age of fifteen, but was turned down and sent to work in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] until he was placed in the Young Soldier's battalion in August 1917. Babcock was then transferred to [[United Kingdom|Britain]], where he continued his training until the end of the war.

Having never seen combat, Babcock never considered himself a veteran and moved to the [[United States]] in the [[1920s]], where he joined the United States army and eventually became an electrician. In [[May 2007]], following the death of [[Dwight Wilson]], he became the last surviving veteran of the First World War who served with the Canadian forces.<ref name="Wilson">{{cite news|last = Bonner|first = Susan|title = Canadian WWI veteran dies at 106|publisher = CBC News| date = [[2007-05-09]]|url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2007/05/09/war-vet.html|accessdate = 2007-09-30}}</ref> Since then, he has received much international attention, including 107<sup>th</sup> birthday greetings from the [[British monarchy|Queen of England]], the Canadian Prime Minister and the Governor General of Canada. 

==Early life==
Babcock was born into a family of thirteen children on a farm in [[Ontario, Canada]].<ref name="VAC">{{cite news|title = Interview with A/Lance-Corporal John Babcock, Veteran of the First World War|publisher = [[Veterans Affairs Canada]]| date = [[2006-11-01]]|url = http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=feature/week2006/vw06_media/jbabcock_interview|accessdate = 2007-09-30}}</ref> According to Babcock, the barn where he was born (which no longer exists) was located off of [[Highway 38 (Ontario)|Highway 38]] in [[South Frontenac, Ontario|South Frontenac]] Township.<ref name="Toronto">{{cite news|last = Warmington|first = Joe|title = Rural Ontario area bursts with pride at the part they play in the adventurous life of 107-year-old WWI vet 'Jack'|publisher = The Toronto Sun| date = [[2007-09-10]]|url = http://www.torontosun.com/News/Columnists/Warmington_Joe/2007/09/10/4483732-sun.php|accessdate = 2007-09-30}}</ref> His father died in 1906 after a tree-cutting accident, when Babcock was only six years old. As described in his account given to [[Maclean's]], while his father was cutting down one tree, another dead tree fell on his shoulder. Though he was brought into the house on [[bobsleigh]], he only survived another two hours. Babcock claimed that this was an "awful blow" to the family.<ref name="Mclean">{{cite news|last = MacQueen|first = Ken|title = Babcock, John (Interview)|publisher = [[Maclean's Magazine]]| date = [[2007-06-11]]|url = http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=M1ARTM0013103|accessdate = 2007-09-30}}</ref>

School was never a concern for the young Babcock, and he did not earn his [[high school]] diploma until the age of 95.<ref name="Mclean"/> On growing up in the area, Babcock claims that he "didn't do very much," although he admits that "It was a fun place to grow up."<ref name="Toronto"/> Babcock partook in fishing, hunting and swimming &mdash; especially around the local [[Sydenham Lake]] &mdash; in order to pass the time with the other kids his age. He would return to the area in 1919, after his wartime experiences, but soon after left for the United States. Nevertheless, Babcock's relatives continue to work at the Crater Dairy farm (named after the [[Holleford Crater]], a remnant of a [[meteoroid|meteor]] strike) and the community grew to greatly respect John.<ref name="Toronto"/>

==World War I==

At 15 and a half years of age, Babcock was impressed by two recruiting officers, one a [[lieutenant]] and one a [[sergeant]], who quoted from ''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (poem)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]'' at Perth Road.<ref name="Mclean"/> Babcock was recruited in [[Sydenham, Frontenac County, Ontario|Sydenham, Ontario]] and joined the 146th Battalion of the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]].<ref name="VAC"/> He was then sent to [[Valcartier]], [[Quebec]]. There he underwent a physical, where it was discovered that he was underage. He was designated status A-4: physical fit but underage.<ref name="Mclean"/>  At the time, the minimum age for combat was ninteen.<ref name="Tommy">{{cite book|last = Holmes|first =Richard|title =Tommy|publisher =HarperPerennial|date = 2005|isbn =978-0007137527}}</ref> Babcock was turned down, but managed to make it all the way to [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] by train before he was stopped by the company commander.<ref name="Mclean"/> 

In Halifax, he was sent to [[Wellington Barracks]], the city's peacetime barracks, where he wrestled freight onto large army vehicles. Tiring of the work, Babock took the opportunity to volunteer for the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] when fifty recruits were call on, claiming that his age was 18.<ref name="Mclean"/> Officials quickly discovered that he was only 16, however, and they placed him in a reserve battalion known as the Boy's (or Young Soldiers) Battalion in August [[1917]].<ref name="VAC"/> Babcock then undertook an ocean voyage to [[England]] and, in [[Liverpool, England|Liverpool]], he was stationed with the 26th Reserve and sent to [[Bexhill-on-Sea]] where he trained with about 1,300 others, about a third of which were veterans from battles in [[France]].<ref name="Mclean"/>

The Young Soldier's Battalion trained the recruits for eight hours a day. In his spare time, Babcock went on leave to [[Scotland]], where he met his first girlfriend, a woman from the [[Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (Britain)|Women's Army Auxiliary Corps]]. He was also introduced to the pleasures of [[beer]] and the horrors of war that some of the older veterans had come across.<ref name="Mclean"/> Babcock asserts that he would have fought in the war, given the chance,<ref name="Review">{{cite news|last = Cannata|first = Amy|title = Last Canadian WWI vet celebrates 107|publisher = Spokesman Review| date = [[2007-07-19]]|url = http://www.spokesmanreview.com/breaking/story.asp?ID=10751|accessdate = 2007-09-30}}</ref> but the war ended before he could be brought to the front lines. For this reason, Babcock claims that he never felt like "a real soldier"<ref name="CBC">{{cite news|last = Brown|first = Chris|title = Last WWI vet celebrates 107th birthday|publisher = CBC News| date = [[2007-07-18]]|url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/07/18/vet-birthday.html|accessdate = 2007-09-30}}</ref> and rarely talked of his experiences until his [[centenarian|centenary]].<ref name="Review"/> He also never joined any veterans associations.<ref name="VAC"/>

===Experiences===

Babcock's brother Manley enlisted after John and served with the engineers as a [[sapper]]. John suffered a nervous breakdown after the war. This, in Babcock's eyes, was one of many psychological problems that occurred during and after the war.<ref name="Mclean"/> He recalls at least one instance where a soldier shot himself with a [[.45]] after his comrades discovered that he had emigrated from [[Germany]], while another ran himself through with a [[bayonet]] after a [[pack drill]].<ref name="Mclean"/> Babcock also recounted the importance of honesty in the [[Canadian Army]]. In one case, one of his fellow comrades stole a dollar watch and received nine months in [[prison]] and Babcock cites that as an example of the strict discipline in the military structure.<ref name="Mclean"/>

==After World War I==

With relatives in the [[United States]], Babcock paid the $7 head tax<ref name="Mclean"/> and moved there in the 1920s.<ref name="VAC"/> He became an [[United States citizen]] in 1946<ref name="Review"/> after a stint in the [[United States Army]], rising to the rank of [[Sergeant#Army 4|Sergeant]]. He still retained a Canadian Army [[pension]] that totaled $750, and he took advantage of veteran vocational training to become an [[electrician]]. He ended up running a small light plant in his home neighborhood of Sydenham.<ref name="Mclean"/> Among his various stations was a post at [[Fort Lewis]] near [[Tacoma, Washington]].<ref name="Review"/> 

Later in life, at the age of 65, Babcock became a pilot.<ref name="VAC"/> As of 2006, he was in good mental and physical health, exemplified by his ability to quickly recite the [[alphabet]] backwards, spell out his name in [[Morse Code]] and take daily walks with his wife to keep in good shape.<ref name="VAC"/> At the age of 100, he wrote an autobiography, which was distributed to family and friends.<ref name="VAC"/> It was titled ''Ten Decades of John Foster Babcock''.<ref name="Review"/> 

Babcock has been married twice, first to Elsie, then to Dorothy, a woman nearly thirty years his junior<ref name="CTV"/> whom he met when she was taking care of his first wife while she was dying.<ref name="VAC"/> Babcock has one son (Jack Jr.),<ref name="CTV"/> one daughter, eight grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. One grandchild, Matt, was an army [[dentist]] in [[Iraq]] during the [[Iraq War]].<ref name="Mclean"/> John and Dorothy live in [[Spokane, Washington]], where Babcock has lived since 1932. Babcock's longevity is not entirely unprecedented; his younger sister Lucy died in [[July 2007]] at the age of 102.<ref name="CTV">{{cite news|title = Canada's sole surviving WWI vet marks birthday|publisher = CTV| date = [[2007-07-18]]|url = http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070718/babcock_birthday_070718/20070718?hub=CTVNewsAt11|accessdate = 2007-10-04}}</ref>

==Last surviving Canadian veteran==

Since the death of Dwight Wilson on [[May 9]], [[2007]], John Babcock is the last known Canadian veteran of the First World War. Babcock is proud of his status as the last surviving World War I veteran, although he does not feel the need to be honoured in a specific [[state funeral#Canada|state funeral]]. Instead, he is of the opinion that "they should commemorate all of them, instead of just one."<ref name="Mclean"/> He was also quoted as saying "I'm sure that all the attention I'm getting isn't because of anything spectacular I've done. It's because I'm the last one."<ref name="Review"/> 

Nevertheless, Babcock received much attention on the occasion of his 107th birthday. Birthday wishes came in from [[Queen Elizabeth II]] (whom Babcock jokes is a "nice looking gal"),<ref name="KXLY"/> [[Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]], [[Governor General of Canada]] [[Micha<U+00EB>lle Jean]] and [[Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister]] [[Peter MacKay]]. Minister of [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] from [[British Columbia]] [[James Moore (Canadian politician)|James Moore]] visited Babcock personally to deliver the gifts and greetings. For his birthday, Babcock and his wife went to [[Rosauers]] for his favourite meal of [[hamburger]]s and [[french fries|fries]].<ref name="KXLY">{{cite news|title = John Babcock, last surviving Canadian WWI vet, celebrates 107th birthday|publisher = kxly.com| date = [[2007-07-18]]|url = http://www.kxly.com/news/?sect_rank=1&section_id=559&story_id=12946|accessdate = 2007-09-30}}</ref> Among the gifts he received was a [[necktie]] adorned with a [[poppy]] pattern, a symbol of World War I.<ref name="Review"/> In his hometown of South Frontenac, mayor Gary Davison sent a letter of congratulations, while the local coffee shop named their local blend, "The Jack," after him.<ref name="Toronto"/>  In addition, the local [[Royal Canadian Legion]] has a collection of World War I items on display, including a [[roll call]] with Babcock's name on it.<ref name="Toronto"/> Babcock credits his [[longevity]] to the intense physical training that he received in both the U.S. and Canadian armies.<ref name="VAC"/>
