'''William Playfair''' (22 September 1759 <U+2013> 11 February 1823) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[engineer]] and [[political economist]], the founder of [[statistical graphics|graphical methods of statistics]].<ref>Paul J. FitzPatrick (1960). "Leading British Statisticians of the Nineteenth Century". In: ''Journal of the American Statistical Association'', Vol. 55, No. 289 (Mar., 1960), pp. 38-70.</ref>

William Playfair invented four types of [[Information graphics|diagrams]]: in 1786 the [[line chart|line graph]] and [[bar chart]] of economic data, and in 1801 the [[pie chart]] and circle graph, used to show part-whole relations.<ref>[[Michael Friendly]] (2008).

Retrieved 7 July 2008.</ref>

==Biography==
Playfair was born in 1759 in Scotland during [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]], a Golden Age in the arts, sciences, industry and commerce. He was the fourth son of the [[reverend]] James Playfair of the parish of Liff & Benvie near the city of [[Dundee]] in [[Scotland]]; his notable brothers were architect [[James Playfair]] and mathematician [[John Playfair]]. His father died in 1772 when William was 13, leaving the eldest brother John to care for the family and his education. After his [[apprenticeship]] with [[Andrew Meikle]], the inventor of the threshing machine, he became draftsman and personal assistant to [[James Watt]] in 1777 at 18.<ref name="IS97">[http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/~spence/Spence_Wainer_1997b.pdf Ian Spence  and Howard Wainer (1997). "Who Was Playfair?". In: ''Chance'' 10, p. 35<U+2013>37.]</ref>

Playfair had a variety of careers. He was in turn a millwright, engineer, draftsman, accountant, inventor, silversmith, merchant, investment broker, economist, statistician, pamphleteer, translator, publicist, land speculator, convict, banker, ardent royalist, editor, blackmailer and journalist. On leaving Watt's company in 1782, he set up a silversmithing business and shop in London, which failed. In 1787 he moved to Paris, taking part in the [[storming of the Bastille]] two years later. He returned to London in 1793, where he opened a "security bank", which also failed. From 1775 he worked as a writer and pamphleteer and did some engineering work.<ref name="IS97"/>

==Work==
Ian Spence and [[Howard Wainer]] in 2001 describe Playfair as "engineer, political economist and scoundrel" while "Eminent Scotsmen" calls him  an "ingenious mechanic and miscellaneous writer." It compares his career with the glorious one of his older brother [[John Playfair]], the distinguished Edinburgh professor, and draws a moral about the importance of "steadiness and consistency of plan" as well as of "genius."<ref>Ian Spence and [[Howard Wainer]] (2001). "William Playfair". In: ''Statisticians of the Centuries''. C.C. Heyde and E. Seneta (eds.)  New York: Springer. pp. 105<U+2013>110.</ref>

===Bar chart===
Two decades before Playfair's first achievements, in 1765 [[Joseph Priestley]] had created the innovation of the first [[timeline]] charts, in which individual bars were used to visualize the life span of a person, and the whole can be used to compare the life spans of multiple persons. According to Beniger and Robyn (1978) "Priestley's timelines proved a commercial success and a popular sensation, and went through dozens of editions".<ref name="JRB78">James R. Beniger and Dorothy L. Robyn (1978). "Quantitative graphics in statistics: A brief history". In: ''The American Statistician''. 32: pp. 1<U+2013>11.</ref>

These timelines directly inspired Wiliam Playfair's invention of the [[bar chart]], which first appeared in his ''Commercial and Political Atlas'', published in 1786. According to Beniger and Robyn (1978) "Playfair was driven to this invention by a lack of data. In his Atlas he had collected a series of 34 plates about the import and export from different countries over the years, which he presented as [[line graph]]s or surface charts: line graphs shaded or tinted between abscissa and function. Because Playfair lacked the necessary series data for Scotland, he graphed its trade data for a single year as a series of 34 bars, one for each of 17 trading partners".<ref name="JRB78"/>

In this bar chart Scotland's imports and exports from and to 17 countries in 1781 are represented. "This bar chart was the first quantitative graphical form that did not locate data either in space, as had coordinates statistical breviary (1801), showing the proportions of the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish Empire]] located in [[Asia]], [[Europe]] and [[Africa]] before 1789]]
Playfair, who argued that charts communicated better than tables of data, has been credited with inventing the [[line chart|line]], [[bar chart|bar]], and [[pie chart]]s.  His time-series plots are still presented as models of clarity.

Playfair first published ''The Commercial and Political Atlas'' in London in 1786.  It contained 43 time-series plots and one bar chart, a form apparently introduced in this work.  It has been described as the first major work to contain statistical graphs.

Playfair's ''[[Statistical Breviary]],'' published in London in 1801, contains what is generally credited as the first [[pie chart]].<ref>[[Edward R. Tufte]] (2001).

===Playfair cycle===
The following quotation, known as the "Playfair cycle," has achieved notoriety as it pertains to the "[[Tytler cycle]]":
{{blockquote|:...wealth and power have never been long permanent in any place.
:...they travel over the face of the earth,
:something like a caravan of merchants.
:On their arrival, every thing is found green and fresh;
:while they remain all is bustle and abundance,
:and, when gone, all is left trampled down, barren, and bare.<ref>William Playfair (1807). [http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?pageno=78&fk_files=195753 ''An Inquiry into the Permanent Causes of the Decline and Fall of Powerful and Wealthy Nations''], p. 102.</ref>}}
