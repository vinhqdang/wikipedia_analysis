'''John Barton "Bart" King''' ([[October 19]] [[1873]]<U+2014>[[October 17]] [[1965]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[cricketer]], active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. King was one of the [[Philadelphian cricket team|Philadelphian]] cricketers that played from the end of the [[19th century]] until the outbreak of [[World War I]]. This period of cricket in the United States was dominated by ''[[Amateur and professional cricketers|gentleman]]'' players <U+2014> men of independent wealth who did not need to work. King was an amateur from a [[middle class|middle-class]] family, who was able to devote time to cricket thanks to a job set up by his teammates. 

King was a skilled [[batsman]], but proved his worth as a [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]]. During his career, he set numerous records in North America and led the [[first-class cricket|first-class]] bowling averages in England in 1908.<ref name='Rolfe'>{{cite book | last = Rolfe | first = John |title=Everything You Want to Know About Sports (Sports Illustrated for Kids) |publisher=Bantam Books for Young Readers |location=New York |year=1994 |isbn=0-553-48166-5 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> He successfully competed against the best cricketers from England and Australia. King was the dominant bowler on his team when it toured England in 1897, 1903, and 1908. He dismissed batsmen with his unique delivery, which he called the "angler," and helped develop the art of [[swing bowling]] in the sport. Many of the great bowlers of today still use the strategies and techniques that he developed.<ref name='SABRUK'> {{cite web|url=http://www.sabruk.org/examiner/10/cricket.html |title=SABR UK Examiner no.10: Baseball and Cricket: Cross-Currents |accessdate=2007-01-31 |last=Synge |first=Allen |date=2007 |publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]] (UK Chapter) }}</ref> [[Plum Warner|Sir Pelham Warner]] described Bart King as one of the finest bowlers of all time,<ref name='WisObit'> {{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/234625.html |title=Wisden - 1966 - Obituaries in 1965 |accessdate=2007-01-31 |date=1966 |publisher=[[Wisden|John Wisden & Co]] }}</ref> and [[Donald Bradman]] called him "America's greatest cricketing son."<ref name='TheDon'>{{cite book | last = Bradman | first = Donald | authorlink = | title = The Art of Cricket | publisher = Robson Books | date = 1998 | pages = | doi = | isbn = }}</ref>

==Early and personal life==
King was born in [[Philadelphia]] in 1873. Early in his life, he worked in the [[linen]] trade. Although this was the family business, his father later allowed him to leave it to enter the [[insurance]] industry. King was not a member of the [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] and wealthy families of Philadelphia that produced many of the era's top cricketers. King's obituary in ''Cricket Quarterly'' suggests that his career in insurance was set up for him by those families to allow him to continue playing the game. In 1913, King married a young woman by the name of Lockhart. The marriage lasted for fifty years.  King's wife died in 1963, and he died in 1965 in his native Philadelphia just two days short of his 92nd birthday. This was also the year which saw the United States gain membership in the [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] after it had been denied during his playing career.<ref name='Quart'>{{Harvard reference | Surname= | Given= | Authorlink= | Title=Obituary of John Barton King | Journal=Cricket Quarterly | Volume=31 | Issue=1 | Year=1966| Page=61| URL=http://www.haverford.edu/library/cricket/JBKING.HTM }}</ref><ref name='Cricinfo'> {{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/usa/content/player/25637.html |title=Cricinfo - Players and Officials - Bart King |accessdate=2007-01-31 |date=2007 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] }}</ref>

Bart King was regarded by many of his contemporaries as a affable person. Ralph Barker called him the [[Bob Hope]] of cricket thanks to his quips and stories. King was also noted for making jabs at opponents, but leaving them laughing at themselves. The same held true when he would question [[umpire (cricket)|umpires]] that turned down his [[appeal (cricket)|appeals]].  He is said to have spoken for ninety minutes at a dinner during his last tour to England, punctuated every few seconds with laughs.  The dinner guests were kept laughing even while King spoke with a [[dead-pan]] expression. One man who attended the dinner noted that King "told his impossible tales with such an air of conviction<U+2026>that his audiences were always in doubt when to take him seriously. He made their task doubly difficult by sprinkling in a fair mixture of truth with his fiction."<ref name='Barke'>{{cite book | last = Barker | first = Ralph | authorlink = | title = Ten Great Bowlers | publisher = Chatto and Windus | date = 1967 | pages = 124<U+2013>155 | doi = | isbn = }}</ref>

==Cricketing career==
[[Image:Belmont Cricket Club House.jpg|right|thumb|King played most of his Philadelphia club career at the [[Belmont Cricket Club]]]]
Like most young American men of this era, Bart King came to cricket only after first playing [[baseball]]. He began to play [[club cricket]] at [[Tioga Cricket Club]] in 1888, aged 15,<ref name='Quart'>{{Harvard reference | Surname= | Given= | Authorlink= | Title=Obituary of John Barton King | Journal=Cricket Quarterly | Volume=31 | Issue=1 | Year=1966| Page=61| URL=http://www.haverford.edu/library/cricket/site_update/famous_King.htm }}</ref> starting out as a [[batsman]].<ref name='WisObit'> {{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/234625.html |title=Wisden - 1966 - Obituaries in 1965 |accessdate=2007-01-31 |date=1966 |publisher=[[Wisden|John Wisden & Co]] }}</ref> Tioga was one of the lesser Philadelphian cricket clubs. King played his first recorded match for the club in 1889, when he was tried as a bowler due to his physique. He took 37 [[wicket]]s for 99 [[run (cricket)|run]]s for the club in the 1889 cricket season.<ref name='Picador'> {{cite book |author=Ramachandra Guha, Ed |title=The Picador Book of Cricket |publisher=Picador |location=New York |year=2001 |isbn=0-330-39612-9 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>

King played for Tioga until 1896, when he joined [[Belmont Cricket Club]]. King joined the [[Philadelphian cricket team]] for three tours of England while playing at Belmont. King's most dominating matches came during these tours, playing with the premier American team of the era.

===Australia in Philadelphia===
In 1893, the [[Australian cricket team|Australian team]] stopped by Philadelphia on its way home from a [[Australian cricket team in England in 1893|tour of England]]. Australia fielded a strong side, but the team was tired after a long tour and trip. In spite of this fatigue, the Australians chose to face the full strength of the Gentlemen of Philadelphia in a three day match starting 29 September.

On a small ground at [[Belmont Cricket Club|Belmont]], the September grass was coarse. It had been rolled so that balls moved very quickly across the ground. The Australian side, fielding first, dropped many [[catch (cricket)|catches]] and could not cope with the short [[boundary (cricket)|boundary]], allowing the Philadelphians reach the huge total of 525 runs. King came in to bat last, at number 11, making 36 runs. The leading Australian bowlers, [[Hugh Trumble]] and [[George Giffen]], took 2 for 104 and 0 for 114 respectively. When the Australians came to bat, they hoped that they would have recovered from their tiring journey, but they ran into problems in dealing with Bart King's developing swing bowling. The side was all out for 199, with King taking 5 wickets for 78 runs. The Australians [[Follow-on|followed on]] and were all out again for 268, allowing the Gentlemen of Philadelphia to win by an [[innings]] and 68 runs.<ref name='CricketArchive1893'> {{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4057.html |title=Philadelphians v Australians in 1893 |accessdate=2007-04-17 |date=2003<U+2013>2007 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] }}</ref>

The cricket world was stunned that a single American city could turn out a side capable of beating the full strength of Australia.  The Australians won the return match on 6 October by six wickets,<ref name='CricketArchive1893-2'> {{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4059.html |title=Philadelphians v Australians in 1893 |accessdate=2007-04-17 |date=2003<U+2013>2007 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] }}</ref> but the Australian captain, [[Jack Blackham]], said to the Americans, "You have better players here than we have been led to believe.

===Tour of England in 1897===
{{main|Philadelphian cricket team in England in 1897}}

King won the Child's Bowling Cup, the premier award for bowling in American cricket, for the first time in 1896,<ref name='Barke'>{{cite book | last = Barker | first = Ralph | authorlink = | title = Ten Great Bowlers | publisher = Chatto and Windus | date = 1967 | pages = 124<U+2013>155 | doi = | isbn = }}</ref> and joined the Philadelphian cricket team's tour of England in 1897. The tour was very ambitious, and was arranged mainly for educational purposes: few of those on the American side expected to win many matches.<ref name='Wis1898Sum'> {{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150157.html |title=Wisden - 1898 - The Philadelphians in England, 1897 |accessdate=2007-01-31 |date=1898 |publisher=[[Wisden|John Wisden & Co]] }}</ref> Previous tours had tended to involve amateur English sides with a low level of competition.  In 1897, the tour started on [[7 June]] at [[Oxford]], ending in late July at [[The Oval]] almost 2 months later.  The schedule included fifteen matches against all of the top [[County Championship|county cricket]] teams, the [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University teams]], the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]], and two other sides, though only a few of the counties thought it worth while to put their best elevens onto the field.<ref name='Wis1898Sum'> {{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150157.html |title=Wisden - 1898 - The Philadelphians in England, 1898 |accessdate=2007-01-31 |date=1998 |publisher=[[Wisden|John Wisden & Co]] }}</ref>

While the tour initially aroused some curiosity, many English fans lost interest until Bart King and the Philadelphians met the full [[Sussex county cricket teams|Sussex]] team at [[Brighton]] on [[17 June]]. King demonstrated his batting abilty in first innings with a fourth-wicket stand of 107 with [[John Lester]].<ref name='CricketArchive2'> {{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/4/4791.html |title=Sussex v Philadelphians in 1897 |accessdate=2007-02-09 |date=2003<U+2013>2007 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] }}</ref> He then took 7 wickets for 13 runs, and Philadelphia dismissed Sussex for 46 in less than an hour.<ref name='Barke'>{{cite book | last = Barker | first = Ralph | authorlink = | title = Ten Great Bowlers | publisher = Chatto and Windus | date = 1967 | pages = 124<U+2013>155 | doi = | isbn = }}</ref> <!--Philadelphians' second innings?--> King took 6 for 102 in Sussex's second innings, helping the Philadelphians to a victory by 8 wickets.<ref name='Quart'>{{Harvard reference | Surname= | Given= | Authorlink= | Title=Obituary of John Barton King | Journal=Cricket Quarterly | Volume=31 | Issue=1 | Year=1966| Page=61| URL=http://www.haverford.edu/library/cricket/site_update/famous_King.htm }}</ref> 

Despite the excitement surrounding King's performance, the Americans did not fare well overall, and the results may have been worse than hoped for the tour's promoters. Philadelphia won only two of their fifteen matches, losing nine and earning a draw in the remaining four. After their win against Sussex, the only other win of the tour came against [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]]. During this match, King took 5 for 95 and 7 for 72 and scored 46 runs.<ref name='Picador'> {{cite book |author=Ramachandra Guha, Ed |title=The Picador Book of Cricket |publisher=Picador |location=New York |year=2001 |isbn=0-330-39612-9 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> According to ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'', King proved himself to be the best bowler on the American side and had to do much of the work. He bowled three hundred [[over (cricket)|over]]s, more than anyone else in the team, taking 72 wickets with a [[bowling average]] of a little over 24 runs. In addition to his bowling, King scored 441 runs as a batsman<ref name='CricketArchive'> {{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/ENG/1897_f_Batting_by_Runs.html |title=First-class Batting and Fielding in England for 1897 (Ordered by Runs) |accessdate=2007-02-09 |date=2003<U+2013>2007 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] }}</ref> at a [[batting average]] of just over 20.<ref name='Wis1898Sum'> {{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150157.html |title=Wisden - 1898 - The Philadelphians in England, 1898 |accessdate=2007-01-31 |date=1998 |publisher=[[Wisden|John Wisden & Co]] }}</ref>

Following the 1897 tour, many English counties were interested in securing King's services. It was thought that he would not play as a professional, so alternative means of remuneration had to be found: one county reportedly offered to arrange a marriage with a widow who had an income of [[pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]7000 per year.<ref name='Picador'> {{cite book |author=Ramachandra Guha, Ed |title=The Picador Book of Cricket |publisher=Picador |location=New York |year=2001 |isbn=0-330-39612-9 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>  In the end, King returned to the United States, where he continued to perform very well in club cricket.

===Tour of England in 1903===
<!--{{main|Philadelphian cricket team in England in 1903}} - should be expanded-->

The Philadelphian team returned to England in 1903. This proved to be King's most successful tour, particularly his performances in the matches against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] and [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]]. King played in 13 of the 15 matches on the tour, missing two with a strained side.  In his first match, against Cambridge University, he took 5 for 136 and 4 for 28. He followed that with 8 for 39 in the first innings against Oxford University, though the match was eventually abandoned as a draw due to rain.  In his next match, against [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]], he took 2 for 26 in the first innings but did not bowl in the second. He also took 7 for 51 and 2 for 28 against a strong [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] side at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]].<ref name='CricketArchive3'> {{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/6/6232.html |title=Marylebone Cricket Club v Philadelphians in 1903 |accessdate=2007-02-09 |date=2003<U+2013>2007 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] }}</ref> Then came the Lancashire match at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground]].<ref name='Barke'>{{cite book | last = Barker | first = Ralph | authorlink = | title = Ten Great Bowlers | publisher = Chatto and Windus | date = 1967 | pages = 124<U+2013>155 | doi = | isbn = }}</ref>

In Lancashire's first innings, King bowled 27 overs and took 5 wickets for 46 runs. The Philadelphians passed Lancashire's first innings score, but their lead was quickly overtaken in Lancashire's second innings.  With the wind strong over King's left shoulder, the scene was set for him to dominate the opposition. In his first over after the lunch break on day two of the match, he [[yorker|yorked]] one of Lancashire's [[opening batsman|opening batsmen]] and his replacement with successive balls.  He clean [[bowled]] two more batsmen in his second over, and bowled a [[stump]] out of the ground in the third. In 3 overs, he had taken 5 wickets for 7 runs. After this performance, King had to be rested in the field. One more wicket was taken before King returned to take 4 more wickets, ending the innings with 9 for 62.<ref name='CricketArchive1903Lancs'> {{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/6/6257.html |title=Lancashire v Philadelphians in 1903 |accessdate=2007-04-17 |date=2003<U+2013>2007 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] }}</ref> The Philadelphians won next morning by nine wickets.<ref name='Picador'> {{cite book |author=Ramachandra Guha, Ed |title=The Picador Book of Cricket |publisher=Picador |location=New York |year=2001 |isbn=0-330-39612-9 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>

Against Surrey on [[6 August]], King was overpowering again. It was in this match that King gave what Barker called his finest first-class performance ever.<ref name='Barke'>{{cite book | last = Barker | first = Ralph | authorlink = | title = Ten Great Bowlers | publisher = Chatto and Windus | date = 1967 | pages = 124<U+2013>155 | doi = | isbn = }}</ref> Batting first, he scored 98 runs in the Philadelphian's first innings before being [[run out]], and he then took 3 for 89 in Surrey's reply. In the second innings, he made 113 [[not out]] and then took 3 for 98.<ref name='CricketArchive4'> {{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/6/6316.html |title=Surrey v Philadelphians in 1903 |accessdate=2007-02-09 |date=2003<U+2013>2007 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] }}</ref> Surrey lost the match by 110 runs. Apparently, King was so exhausted after his performance that he fell asleep during a speech by the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] [[Richard Webster, 1st Viscount Alverstone|Lord Alverstone]] at a banquet after the match.<ref name='Quart'>{{Harvard reference | Surname= | Given= | Authorlink= | Title=Obituary of John Barton King | Journal=Cricket Quarterly | Volume=31 | Issue=1 | Year=1966| Page=61| URL=http://www.haverford.edu/library/cricket/site_update/famous_King.htm }}</ref>

===Tour of England in 1908===
<!--{{main|Philadelphian cricket team in England in 1908}} - should be expanded-->

King toured England with the Philadelphians a third time in 1908. This tour included both first-class matches and more minor ones. The first match that was played was against South Wales in [[Cardiff]]. The Philadelphians won by 36 behind the bowling of King and [[Ranji Hordern]]. The pair took all 20 wickets of the Welsh side.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/7/7627.html |title=South Wales v Philadelphians in 1908 |accessdate=2007-04-18 |last= |first= |date=2003<U+2013>2007 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] }}</ref> After this, the first-class matches began with [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]] on [[9 July]]. Again the Philadelphians won and again Hordern and King took most of the wickets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/7/7632.html |title=Worcestershire v Philadelphians in 1908 |accessdate=2007-04-18 |last= |first= |date=2003<U+2013>2007 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] }}</ref> This trend continued throughout the tour. In the first-class matches that King played, the Philadelphians recorded four wins and six losses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Seasons/ENG/1908_ENG_Philadelphians_in_England_1908.html |title=Philadelphians in England 1908 |accessdate=2007-04-18 |last= |first= |date=2003<U+2013>2007 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] }}</ref> Although he was already 35 years old, King had posted extraordinary numbers in his bowling. He topped the bowling averages for the entire [[1908 English cricket season]] at 11.01. This mark was not bettered until 1958, when [[Les Jackson]] of [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]] posted an average of 10.99.<ref name='SABRUK'> {{cite web|url=http://www.sabruk.org/examiner/10/cricket.html |title=SABR UK Examiner no.10: Baseball and Cricket: Cross-Currents |accessdate=2007-01-31 |last=Synge |first=Allen |date=2007 |publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]] (UK Chapter) }}</ref>

===Later career ===
King's cricketing career did not end with his last first-class match. He continued to play club matches in Philadelphia and participated in non-first-class fixtures around the continent. King is noted for holding the bowling record against [[Canadian cricket team|Canada]]. On a rainy afternoon at Philadelphia in 1906,<!--date?--> King bowled into a slight breeze to capture 8 wickets for 17 runs.<ref name='Cricinfo2'> {{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/NATIONAL/ICC_MEMBERS/CAN/CCA_HISTORY_11SEP1997.html |title=Cricinfo - Canada |accessdate=2007-01-31 |last=Boller |first=Kevin |date=2007 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] }}</ref> This record came in a four-year period during which King focused on club cricket in Philadelphia, when he won the city's batting award three times and the bowling award four times.<ref name='Barke'>{{cite book | last = Barker | first = Ralph | authorlink = | title = Ten Great Bowlers | publisher = Chatto and Windus | date = 1967 | pages = 124<U+2013>155 | doi = | isbn = }}</ref>

King played in his last two international matches in 1912, against Australia.  His performances were of the highest quality, given that he was nearing his fortieth year.<ref name='Quart'>{{Harvard reference | Surname= | Given= | Authorlink= | Title=Obituary of John Barton King | Journal=Cricket Quarterly | Volume=31 | Issue=1 | Year=1966| Page=61| URL=http://www.haverford.edu/library/cricket/site_update/famous_King.htm }}</ref> In the first match, he took 9 wickets for 78 runs to help Philadelphia win by 2 runs; in the second, Australia won by 45 runs despite him taking 8 for 74.

King joined the [[Philadelphia Cricket Club]] after the 1912 season. Despite being well past his 40th year, he continued to play competitive cricket for another 4 years. His 27-year career ended with his last game for the Philadelphia Cricket Club against Frankford, on [[20 July]] [[1916]]. On this occasion, his bowling and batting skills had declined, but he maintained a batting average of 43.33 for that final season.<ref name='Quart'>{{Harvard reference | Surname= | Given= | Authorlink= | Title=Obituary of John Barton King | Journal=Cricket Quarterly | Volume=31 | Issue=1 | Year=1966| Page=61| URL=http://www.haverford.edu/library/cricket/site_update/famous_King.htm }}</ref>

King died at a [[nursing home]] in his native Philadelphia in 1965, two days short of his 92nd birthday.<ref name="timesobit">{{cite news|title=Obituary &mdash; J. B. King|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=[[1965-10-23]]|page=10}}</ref> ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper in the UK ran an obituary for him, which quoted Plum Warner as saying that: "Had he been an Englishman or an Australian, he would have been even more famous than he was."<ref name="timesobit"/>

==Achievements and legacy==
[[Image:John Barton King Bowling.jpg|right|thumb|Bart King's bowling delivery]]
Though King focused on bowling throughout his career, he was also a very fine batsman. In 1905, he established a North American record batting record by scoring 315 at the [[Germantown Cricket Club]].  The following year, he scored 344 not out for Belmont against the [[Merion Cricket Club]], setting a North American batting record which still stands.<ref name='Cricinfo2'> {{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/NATIONAL/ICC_MEMBERS/CAN/CCA_HISTORY_11SEP1997.html |title=Cricinfo - Canada |accessdate=2007-01-31 |last=Boller |first=Kevin |date=2007 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] }}</ref> He scored 39 centuries in his North American career, and he topped 1,000 runs in six seasons.  He took over 100 wickets in eight seasons, including a double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in four seasons.  In his whole career, he scored 19,808 runs at an average of 36.47, and took 2,088 wickets at an average of 10.47.<ref name='Quart'>{{Harvard reference | Surname= | Given= | Authorlink= | Title=Obituary of John Barton King | Journal=Cricket Quarterly | Volume=31 | Issue=1 | Year=1966| Page=61| URL=http://www.haverford.edu/library/cricket/site_update/famous_King.htm }}</ref>  He took all 10 wickets in an innings on three occasions, and took 9 wickets in an innings five times. One of these occasions, in the [[Ireland cricket team|Gentlemen of Ireland]]'s first innings in 1909, was followed by a [[hat-trick]] in the second innings.<ref name='CricArchive'> {{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/8/8031.html |title=Cricket Archive - Philadelphians v Ireland in 1909 |accessdate=2007-01-31 |date=2003<U+2013>2007 |publisher=[[Cricket Archive]] }}</ref>

There is an apochryphal story of King emulating a famous baseball pitcher of the day, [[Rube Waddell]], by sending all his fielders back into the pavilion and finishing off the opponent's innings on his own. King and Belmont were playing Trenton in the Halifax Cup at Elmwood Cricket Ground. Some versions of the story have him banishing the fielders and then calling one of them to a position 22 yards back and 4 yards to the leg side.

Thanks to his dominant performance over his career and his renown in the world of cricket, King was elected an honorary member of the Incogniti Cricket Club in 1908 and an honorary life member of the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] in 1962.<ref name='Quart'>{{Harvard reference | Surname= | Given= | Authorlink= | Title=Obituary of John Barton King | Journal=Cricket Quarterly | Volume=31 | Issue=1 | Year=1966| Page=61| URL=http://www.haverford.edu/library/cricket/site_update/famous_King.htm }}</ref> When [[Plum Warner]] was asked to name the greatest bowler who ever lived, he said that John Barton King, "at the top of his power and speed, was at least the equal of the greatest of them all."<ref name='Barke'>{{cite book | last = Barker | first = Ralph | authorlink = | title = Ten Great Bowlers | publisher = Chatto and Windus | date = 1967 | pages = 124<U+2013>155 | doi = | isbn = }}</ref>

King is credited as one of the first bowlers to perfect [[swing bowling]].

The impact of King's bowling was very far-reaching. Before King and the Philadelphians toured England, English fast bowlers depended on sheer [[fast bowling|pace]], with a possible last-second application of spin. After seeing King's work with the ball, many became "complete anglers" in the Barton King mold. A bowler like [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire's]] [[George Hirst]] started to shatter stumps with balls that ducked in with the force of a hard throw in from mid-off. The "swingers" became even more numerous through the decades.<ref name='SABRUK'> {{cite web|url=http://www.sabruk.org/examiner/10/cricket.html |title=SABR UK Examiner no.10: Baseball and Cricket: Cross-Currents |accessdate=2007-01-31 |last=Synge |first=Allen |date=2007 |publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]] (UK Chapter) }}</ref>
