'''Pittsburgh Compound B''' (PiB) is a [[fluorescent]] derivative of [[Thioflavin T]], which can be used in [[positron emission tomography]] scans to image [[beta-amyloid]] plaques in [[neuronal tissue]].  Due to this property, Pittsburgh Compound B may be used in investigational studies of [[Alzheimer's Disease]].

== History of PiB ==

The definitive diagnosis of [[Alzheimer's Disease]] can only be made following the demonstration of the presence of [[beta-amyloid]] plaques and [[Neurofibrillary tangles]], the pathologic hallmarks of [[Alzheimer's Disease]] in brain tissue, typically at autopsy.  While the cognitive impairments of the disease could be monitored throughout the disease course, clinicians had no reliable way to monitor the pathologic progression of the disease.  Due to this fact, a clear understanding of the process of amyloid deposition and how amyloid deposits relate to the cognitive symptoms of [[Alzheimer's Disease]] remains to be elucidated.  While sophisticated centers for the treatment of [[Alzheimer's Disease]] are able to diagnose the disease with some reliability based on its clinical presentation, the [[differential diagnosis]] of [[Alzheimer's Disease]] from other [[dementias]] is less robust.  Furthermore, as novel disease-modifying therapies for [[Alzheimer's Disease]] that attack and remove [[beta-amyloid]] deposits from the brain enter clinical trials, a tool for assessing their effectiveness at clearing the amyloid deposits was a much needed development. 

To answer these needs, a research team from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] led by geriatric psychiatrist William E. Klunk and radiochemist Chester A. Mathis identified a class of neutrally charged [[benzothiazoles]] derived from [[Thioflavin T]], which included a small number compounds with suitable properties for use as a [[positron emission tomography]] imaging agent.  One of these compounds, [N-methyl-<sup>11</sup>C]2-(4'-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole, emerged as the lead agent to develop in human subjects. The [[University of Pittsburgh]] team partnered with a team of researchers from [[Uppsala University]] in [[Uppsala]], [[Sweden]], to conduct the first trials of this new agent in human research subjects. As this was the second investigational compound of this class sent to Uppsala from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] group, it was termed simply Pittsburgh compound-B by the Swedish team, who also abbreviated it as "PiB".   

The first PiB study of a human subject with a clinical diagnosis of [[Alzheimer's Disease]] was conducted in February, 2002, at [[Uppsala University]].  PET scans showed that the compound was retained in areas of the [[cerebral cortex]] known to contain significant amyloid deposits from post-mortem examinations.  The initial human study of PiB was expanded to include 16 [[Alzheimer's Disease]] subjects and 9 cognitively normal controls, the report of which was published in 2004 in the Annals of Neurology<ref>Klunk, W.E., et al., Imaging brain amyloid in Alzheimer's disease with Pittsburgh Compound-B.[see comment]. Annals of Neurology, 2004. 55(3): p. 306-19.</ref>. 

Since that inital study, PiB has been adopted as a research tool by dozens of research institutions around the world.  PiB and other compounds in its class are protected under U.S.[[patent]] number 7,270,800, issued Sept. 18, 2007, which is presently assigned to the [[University of Pittsburgh]].  The technology is under license to [[GE Healthcare]], a subsidiary of [[General Electric]], who is pursuing the development of a clinical diagnostic agent based on PiB for assessing brain [[amyloidosis]].
