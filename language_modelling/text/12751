'''Harvey Bernard Milk''' (May 22, 1930 <U+2013> November 27, 1978) was an American politician and the first openly [[gay]] man to be elected to public office in California, as a member of the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]]. Milk was born and raised in New York where he acknowledged his homosexuality as an adolescent, but chose to pursue sexual relationships with secrecy and discretion well into his adult years. His experience in the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] caused him to shed many of his conservative views about individual freedom and the expression of sexuality. 

Milk moved to San Francisco in 1972 and opened a camera store. Although he had been restless, holding an assortment of jobs and moving house frequently, he settled in [[The Castro, San Francisco, California|The Castro]], a neighborhood that was experiencing a mass immigration of gay men and lesbians. He was compelled to run for city supervisor in 1973, though he encountered resistance from the existing gay political establishment. His campaign was compared to theater; he was brash, outspoken, animated, and outrageous, earning media attention and votes, although not enough to be elected. He campaigned again in the next two supervisor elections, dubbing himself the "Mayor of Castro Street". Voters responded enough to warrant his running for the [[California State Assembly]] as well.  Taking advantage of his growing popularity, he led the gay political movement in fierce battles against anti-gay initiatives. Milk was elected city supervisor in 1977 after San Francisco reorganized its election procedures to choose representatives from neighborhoods rather than through city-wide ballots.

Milk served almost eleven months as city supervisor and was responsible for passing a stringent [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]] ordinance in San Francisco. On November 27, 1978, Milk and Mayor [[George Moscone]] [[Moscone<U+2013>Milk assassinations|were assassinated]] by [[Dan White]], another city supervisor who had recently resigned and wanted his job back.  Both Milk's election and the events following his assassination demonstrated the liberalization of the population and political conflicts between the city government and a conservative police force.

Milk has become an icon in San Francisco and "a martyr for gay rights", according to [[University of San Francisco]] professor Peter Novak.<ref>Nolte, Carl (November 26, 2003). "City Hall Slayings: 25 Years Later", ''The San Francisco Chronicle'', p. A-1.</ref> While established political organizers in the city insisted gays work with liberal politicians and use restraint in reaching their objectives, Milk outspokenly encouraged gays to use their growing power in the city and support each other. His goal was to give hope to disenfranchised gays around the country. In 2002, he was called "the most famous and most significantly open [[LGBT]] official ever elected in the United States".<ref>Smith and Haider-Markel, p. 204.</ref> Writer John Cloud remarked on his influence, "After he defied the governing class of San Francisco in 1977 to become a member of its board of supervisors, many people<U+2014>straight and gay<U+2014>had to adjust to a new reality he embodied: that a gay person could live an honest life and succeed."<ref name="cloud"/>

== Early life ==
[[Image:Robert and Harvey Milk 1934.JPG|thumb|upright|Harvey (right) and his older brother Robert in 1934]]

Harvey Bernard Milk was born in [[Woodmere, New York]] on [[Long Island]] on May 22, 1930 to William and Minerva Karns Milk. He was the younger son of eastern European Jewish parents and the grandson of a Lithuanian salesman, Morris Milk, who eventually owned a department store<ref name="scribner"/><ref name="ewb"/> and helped to organize the first synagogue in the area.<ref>Shilts, p. 4.</ref> As a child, Milk was teased for his protruding ears, big nose, and oversized feet, and tended to grab attention as a class clown. He played football in school, and developed a passion for opera. In his teens, he acknowledged his homosexuality, but kept it a guarded secret. Under his name in the high school yearbook, it read, "Glimpy Milk<U+2014>and they say WOMEN are never at a loss for words".<ref>Shilts, p. 9.</ref>

Milk attended New York State College for Teachers in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] (now the [[University at Albany]]) from 1947 to 1951, majoring in mathematics. He wrote for the college newspaper, and earned a reputation as a gregarious, friendly student. None of his friends in high school or college ever suspected that he was gay. One classmate remembered, "He was never thought of as a possible [[queer]]<U+2014>that's what you called them then<U+2014>he was a man's man".<ref>Shilts, p. 14.</ref> After graduation, Milk joined the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] during the [[Korean War]]. He served aboard the [[Submarine rescue ship|submarine rescue ship]] [[USS Kittiwake (ASR-13)|USS ''Kittiwake'']] as a [[United States Navy Diver|diving officer]].  He later transferred to [[Naval Base San Diego|Naval Station, San Diego]]<!--Do not change the piped name, this was the name of the base in the 1950's--> to serve as a diving instructor.<ref name="ewb"/> In 1955, he was discharged from the Navy at the rank of [[lieutenant, junior grade]].<ref group=note>Milk said numerous times that he was discharged from the Navy because he was gay, but Randy Shilts was skeptical of this claim, stating: "The Harvey Milk of this era was no political activist, and according to available evidence, he played the more typical balancing act between discretion and his sex drive." (p. 16) Scholar Karen Foss confirms his discharge from the Navy had no connection to his sexuality and states, "While exaggeration is a frequent campaign tactic, in Milk's case such embellishments served to demonstrate his willingness to be part of the political system while also maintain his distance from it." (See citations list for ''Queer Words, Queer Images'', p. 21.)</ref>

=== Early career ===

Milk's early career was marked by frequent changes; in later years he would take delight in talking about his metamorphosis from a middle-class Jewish boy. He began teaching at [[George W. Hewlett High School]] on Long Island. In 1956 he met Joe Campbell at the [[Jacob Riis Park]] beach, a popular location for gay men in Queens. Campbell was seven years younger than Milk, and Milk pursued him passionately. Even after they moved in together, Milk wrote Campbell romantic notes and poems.<ref>Shilts p. 20.</ref> Quickly growing bored, they decided to move to Texas, but they were unhappy there and moved back to New York where Milk got a job as an actuarial statistician at an insurance firm.<ref name="alch">"Historical Note", [http://sfpl.org/librarylocations/main/glc/pdf/Harvey_Milk_Papers-Susan_Davis_Alch_Collection.pdf ''The Harvey Milk Papers: Susan Davis Alch Collection (1956<U+2013>1962)''] (PDF), [http://sfpl.lib.ca.us/ San Francisco Public Library]. Retrieved on October 8, 2008.</ref>  Campbell and Milk separated after almost six years; it would be his longest relationship. 

Milk tried to separate his early romantic life from his family and work. Once again bored and single in New York, he thought of moving to Miami to marry a lesbian friend to "have&nbsp;... [[beard (companion)|a front]] & each would not be in the way of the other".<ref name="alch"/> However, he remained in New York and secretly pursued gay relationships. In 1962 Milk became involved with [[Craig Rodwell]], who was ten years younger. Though Milk courted Rodwell ardently, waking him every morning with a call and sending him notes, Milk was discouraged by Rodwell's involvement with the New York [[Mattachine Society]], a gay activist organization. When Rodwell was arrested for walking in Riis Park, charged with inciting a riot and indecent exposure (the law required men's swimsuits to extend from above the navel to below the thigh), he spent three days in jail. The relationship soon ended as Milk became alarmed at Rodwell's tendency to agitate the police.<ref>Shilts, p. 24<U+2013>29.</ref>

Milk abruptly stopped working as an insurance salesman and became a researcher at the [[Wall Street]] firm [[Bache & Co.|Bache & Company]]. He was frequently promoted despite his tendency to offend the older members of the firm by ignoring their advice and flaunting his success.  Although he was skilled at his job, co-workers sensed that Milk's heart was not in his work.<ref name="scribner">"Harvey Bernard Milk." ''Dictionary of American Biography'', Supplement 10: 1976<U+2013>1980. Charles Scribner's Sons, 1995.</ref> He started a relationship with Jack Galen McKinley, and recruited him in the fight against the proliferation of big government by persuading McKinley to work on conservative Republican [[Barry Goldwater]]'s [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential campaign]].<ref>Shilts, p. 33</ref> Their relationship was troubled: McKinley was prone to depression and frequently threatened to commit suicide if Milk did not show him enough attention.<ref>Shilts, p. 35<U+2013>36.</ref> To make a point to McKinley, Milk took him to the hospital where Milk's ex-lover Joe Campbell was recuperating from a suicide attempt, after his lover<U+2014>a man named Billy Sipple<U+2014>left him.  Milk had remained friendly with Campbell, who had entered the ''[[avant garde]]'' art scene in [[Greenwich Village]], and did not understand why Campbell's despondency was sufficient cause to consider suicide as an option.<ref>Shilts, p. 36<U+2013>37.</ref>

== Move to San Francisco ==
=== Rise of Castro Street ===

The [[Eureka Valley, San Francisco, California|Eureka Valley of San Francisco]], where [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market]] and Castro Streets intersect, had for decades been a blue-collar Irish Catholic neighborhood synonymous with the Most Holy Redeemer Parish. Beginning in the 1960s, however, suburbs in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and [[Oakland]] attracted young families with children, and the city's economic base eroded as factories moved to cheaper locations nearby. Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]], proud of his working-class background and supporters, based his political career on welcoming developers and attracting a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] to the city. Many blue-collar workers<U+2014>often Alioto supporters<U+2014>lost their jobs as large corporations with service industry positions replaced factory and dry dock jobs. San Francisco had been "a city of villages": a decentralized city with ethnic enclaves that each surrounded its own main street.<ref name="castroI">FitzGerald, Frances (July 21, 1986). "A Reporter at Large: The Castro <U+2014> I", ''The New Yorker'', p. 34<U+2013>70.</ref> As the downtown area developed, neighborhoods suffered, including Castro Street.<ref>Weiss, p. 28<U+2013>29.</ref> The Most Holy Redeemer Parish shops shut down, and houses were abandoned and shuttered.<ref>de Jim, p.&nbsp;36.</ref> In 1963, real estate prices plummeted when most of the working-class families tried to sell their houses quickly after a gay bar opened in the neighborhood. [[Hippies]], attracted to the [[Summer of Love|free love]] ideals of the [[Haight-Ashbury]] area but repulsed by the crime rate, bought some of the cheap Victorian houses.

Since the end of World War II, the major port city of San Francisco had been home to a sizable number of gay men expelled from the military who had decided to stay rather than return to their hometowns and face ostracism.<ref name="demilio">D'Emilio, John. "Gay Politics and Community in San Francisco since World War II", in ''Hidden From History: Reclaiming the Gay and Lesbian Past'', New American Library (1989). ISBN 0453006892</ref>  By 1969 San Francisco had more gay people per capita than any other American city; when the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] asked the [[Kinsey Institute]] to survey homosexuals, the Kinsey Institute chose San Francisco as its focus.<ref>Clendinen, p.&nbsp;151.</ref>  Milk and McKinley were among the thousands of gay men attracted to San Francisco. McKinley was a stage manager for [[Tom O'Horgan]], a producer who started his career in experimental theater, but soon graduated to much larger [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions. They arrived in 1969 with the Broadway touring company of ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''. McKinley was offered a job in the New York City production of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'', and their tempestuous relationship came to an end. The city appealed to Milk so much that he decided to stay, working at an investment firm. In 1970, increasingly frustrated with the political climate after the [[Cambodian Campaign|U.S. invasion of Cambodia]], Milk started to grow his hair. When told to cut it, he refused and was fired.<ref>Shilts, p. 38<U+2013>41.</ref>

Milk drifted from California to Texas to New York without a steady job or plan. In New York he became involved with O'Horgan's theater company as a "general aide", signing on as associate producer for ''Lenny'' and for [[Eve Merriam]]'s ''Inner City''.<ref>Barnes, Clive (December 20, 1971). "Theater: The York of 'Inner City'", ''The New York Times'', p. 48.</ref><ref name="ohorgan">Gruen, John (January 2, 1972). "Do You Mind Critics Calling You Cheap, Decadent, Sensationalistic, Gimmicky<U+2014>", ''The New York Times'', p. SM14.</ref> The time he had spent with the cast of [[flower children]] had worn away much of Milk's conservatism. A ''New York Times'' story about O'Horgan described Milk as "a sad eyed man<U+2014>another aging hippie with long, long hair, wearing faded jeans and pretty beads".<ref name="ohorgan"/> Craig Rodwell read the description of the formerly uptight man and wondered if it could be the same person.<ref name="shilts44-46">Shilts, p. 44.</ref> One of Milk's Wall Street friends worried that he seemed to have no plan or future, but remembered Milk's attitude: "I think he was happier than at any time I had ever seen him in his entire life."<ref name="shilts44-46"/>

Milk met Scott Smith, 20 years his junior, and began another relationship. He and Smith, now indistinguishable from other long-haired, bearded hippies, returned to San Francisco and lived on money they had saved.<ref name="shilts44-46"/> In 1972 a roll of film Milk dropped off to be developed was ruined; with their last $1,000, Milk opened a camera store on Castro Street.<ref name="shilts65">Shilts, p.&nbsp;65.</ref>

=== Changing politics ===

In the late 1960s, the [[Society for Individual Rights]] (SIR) and the [[Daughters of Bilitis]] (DOB) began to work against police persecution of gay bars and [[entrapment]] in San Francisco.  [[Oral sex]] was still a [[felony]], and in 1970, nearly 90&nbsp;people in the city were arrested for it. Facing eviction if caught having homosexual sex in a rented apartment, and unwilling to face arrest in gay bars, some men turned to having sex in public parks at night.  Mayor Alioto asked the police to target the parks, appealing to the Archdiocese and his Catholic supporters.  In 1971, 2,800&nbsp;gay men were arrested for public sex in San Francisco. By comparison, New York City recorded only 63 arrests for the same offense that year.<ref>Shilts, p. 62.</ref> Any arrest for a morals charge required registration as a [[sex offender]].<ref name="clendinen154">Clendinen, p.&nbsp;154.</ref>

Representative [[Phillip Burton]], Assemblyman [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]], and other California politicians recognized the growing clout and organization of homosexuals in the city, and courted their votes by attending meetings of gay and lesbian organizations. Brown pushed for legalization of sex between consenting adults in 1969 but failed.<ref>Clendinen, p. &nbsp;150<U+2013>151.</ref> SIR was also pursued by popular moderate Supervisor [[Dianne Feinstein]] in her bid to become mayor, opposing Alioto. Ex-policeman Richard Hongisto worked for ten years to change the conservative views of the [[San Francisco Police Department]], and also actively appealed to the gay community, which responded by raising significant funds for his campaign for sheriff. Though Feinstein was unsuccessful, Hongisto's win in 1971 showed the political clout of the gay community.<ref>Clendinen, p.&nbsp;156<U+2013>159.</ref>

SIR had become powerful enough for political maneuvering. In 1971 SIR members [[Jim Foster (activist)|Jim Foster]], Rick Stokes, and ''[[The Advocate|Advocate]]'' publisher David Goodstein formed the [[Alice B. Toklas LGBT Democratic Club|Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club]], known as simply "Alice". Alice befriended liberal politicians  to persuade them to sponsor bills, proving successful in 1972 when [[Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon]] obtained Feinstein's support for an ordinance outlawing employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Alice chose Stokes to run for a relatively unimportant seat on the community college board. Though Stokes received 45,000&nbsp;votes, he was quiet, unassuming, and did not win.<ref>Clendinen, p.&nbsp;161<U+2013>163.</ref> Foster, however, shot to national prominence by being the first openly gay man to address a political convention. His speech at the [[1972 Democratic National Convention]] ensured that his voice, according to San Francisco politicians, was the one to be heard when they wanted the opinions, and especially the votes, of the gay community.<ref>Shilts, p.&nbsp;61<U+2013>65.</ref>

One day in 1973 a state bureaucrat entered Milk's shop, Castro Camera, informing him that he owed $100 as a deposit against state sales tax. Milk was suspicious and traded shouts with the man about the rights of business owners; after he complained for weeks at state offices, the deposit was reduced to $30. Milk fumed about government priorities when a teacher came into his store to borrow a projector because the equipment in the schools did not function. Friends also remember around the same time having to restrain him from kicking the television while [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[John N. Mitchell]] gave consistent "I don't recall" replies during the [[United States Senate Watergate Committee|Watergate hearings]].<ref>Shilts, p.&nbsp;65<U+2013>72.</ref> Milk decided that the time had come to run for city supervisor. He said later, "I finally reached the point where I knew I had to become involved or shut up".<ref>"Milk Entered Politics Because 'I Knew I Had To Become Involved'&nbsp;", ''The San Francisco Examiner'' (November 28, 1978), p. 2.</ref>

== Campaigns ==
[[Image:Harvey Milk with Audrey Milk 1973.jpg|thumb|250 px|Milk, here with his sister-in-law in front of Castro Camera in 1973, had been changed by his experience with the counterculture of the 1960s. [[Dianne Feinstein]], who first met him in 1973, did not recognize him when she met him again in 1978.<ref>Shilts, p. 76.</ref>]]

Milk's reception by the gay political establishment in San Francisco was icy. Jim Foster, who had by then been active in gay politics for ten years, resented the newcomer's asking for his endorsement for a position as prestigious as city supervisor. Foster told Milk, "There's an old saying in the Democratic Party. You don't get to dance unless you put up the chairs. I've never seen you put up the chairs."<ref>Shilts, p.&nbsp;73.</ref> Milk was furious at the patronizing snub, and the conversation marked the beginning of an antagonistic relationship between Alice and Harvey Milk. Some gay bar owners, still battling police harassment and unhappy with what they saw as a timid approach by Alice to established authority in the city, decided to endorse him.<ref>Shilts, p. 75.</ref>

Though he had drifted throughout his life thus far, Milk had found his vocation, according to journalist [[Frances FitzGerald]], who called him a "born politician".<ref name="castroI"/> At first, his inexperience showed.  He tried to do without money, support, and staff, and instead relied on his message of conservative financial management, promoting individuals over large corporations and government.<ref name="castroI"/> He supported the reorganization of supervisor elections from a city-wide ballot to district ballots, which reduced the influence of money and gave neighborhoods more control over their representatives in city government. He also ran on a socially liberal platform, opposing government interference in private sexual matters and favoring the [[Legal history of marijuana in the United States|legalization of marijuana]]. Milk's fiery, flamboyant speeches and savvy media skills earned him a significant amount of press during the 1973 election. He earned 16,900&nbsp;votes<U+2014>sweeping the Castro District and other liberal neighborhoods<U+2014>coming in 10th place out of 32&nbsp;candidates.<ref>"S.F. Vote Tally: Supervisors", ''The San Francisco Chronicle'' (November 7, 1973), p. 3.</ref> Had the elections been reorganized to allow districts to elect their own supervisors, he would have won.<ref>Shilts, p.&nbsp;78<U+2013>80.</ref>

=== Mayor of Castro Street ===

<!-- {{Quote box2|width=40%|align=right|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|quote=<div style="text-align:left;"> ''Harvey spent most of his life looking for a stage. On Castro Street he finally found it.''

</div> -->

Milk displayed an affinity for building coalitions early in his political career. The [[Teamsters]] union wanted to strike against beer distributors who refused to sign the union contract. An organizer asked Milk for assistance with gay bars; in return, Milk asked the union to hire more gay drivers. A few days later, Milk canvassed the gay bars in and surrounding the Castro District, urging them to refuse to sell the beer. With the help of a coalition of Arab and Chinese grocers the Teamsters had also recruited, the boycott was immensely successful.<ref>Shilts, p. 83.</ref> Milk found a strong political ally in organized labor, and it was around this time he began to style himself "The Mayor of Castro Street".<ref>"Harvey Bernard Milk". ''Biography Resource Center Online''. Gale Group, 1999. Reproduced in [http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/BioRC Biography Resource Center], Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2008. Subscription required.</ref> As Castro Street grew, so did Milk's reputation. Tom O'Horgan remarked, "Harvey spent most of his life looking for a stage. On Castro Street he finally found it."<ref name="shilts65"/>

Tensions between the older citizens of the Most Holy Redeemer Parish and the immigration of gays entering the Castro District were heightened in 1973. When two gay men tried to open an antique shop, the Eureka Valley Merchants Association (EVMA) attempted to prevent them from receiving a business license. Milk and a few other gay business owners founded the Castro Village Association, with Milk as the president. He often repeated his philosophy that gays should buy from gay businesses. Milk organized the [[Castro Street Fair]] in 1974 to attract more customers to the area.<ref name="ewb">"Harvey Bernard Milk". ''Encyclopedia of World Biography'', 2nd ed. 17 Vols. Gale Research, 1998.</ref> More than 5,000 attended, and some of the EVMA members were stunned; they did more business at the Castro Street Fair than on any previous day.<ref>Shilts, p. 90.</ref>

=== Serious candidate ===

Although he was a newcomer to the Castro District, Milk had shown leadership in the small community. He was starting to be taken seriously as a candidate and decided to run again for supervisor in 1975. He reconsidered his approach and cut his long hair, swore off marijuana, and vowed never to visit another [[gay bathhouse]] again.<ref>Shilts, p. 80.</ref> Milk's campaigning earned the support of the teamsters, firefighters, and construction unions. Castro Camera became the center of activity in the neighborhood. Milk would often pull people off the street to work his campaigns for him<U+2014>many discovered later that they just happened to be the type of men Milk found attractive.<ref>Shilts, p. 138.</ref>

Milk favored support for small businesses and the growth of neighborhoods.<ref>Shilts, p. 96.</ref> Since 1968, Mayor Alioto had been luring large corporations to the city despite what critics labeled "the Manhattanization of San Francisco".<ref>"Joseph Lawrence Alioto." ''The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives'', Volume 5: 1997-1999. Charles Scribner's Sons, 2002.</ref> As blue-collar jobs were replaced by the service industry, Alioto's weakened political base allowed for new leadership to be voted into office in the city. [[George Moscone]] was elected mayor. Moscone had been instrumental in repealing the [[sodomy law]] earlier that year in the California State Legislature. He acknowledged Milk's influence in his election by visiting Milk's election night headquarters, thanking Milk personally, and offering him a position as a city commissioner. Milk came in seventh place in the election, only one position away from earning a supervisor seat.<ref>Shilts, p. 107<U+2013>108.</ref> Liberal politicians held the offices of the mayor, district attorney, and sheriff.

Despite the new leadership in the city, there were still conservative strongholds. One of Moscone's first acts as mayor was appointing a police chief to the embattled [[San Francisco Police Department]] (SFPD). He chose Charles Gain, against the wishes of the SFPD. Most of the force disliked Gain for criticizing the police in the press for racial insensitivity and alcohol abuse on the job, instead of working within the command structure to change attitudes.<ref group=note>Gain further alienated the SFPD by attending a raucous party in 1977 called the Hooker's Ball. The party grew out of control and Gain had to call in reinforcements to control the excesses, but a photograph ran in the papers of him holding a champagne bottle standing beside [[COYOTE|prostitution rights]] activist [[Margo St. James]] and a drag queen named "Wonder Whore". (Weiss, p. 137<U+2013>138.)</ref> By request of the mayor, Gain made it clear that gay police officers would be welcomed in the department; this became national news. Police under Gain expressed their hatred of him, and of the mayor for betraying them.<ref>Weiss, p. 130<U+2013>133.</ref>

=== "Heroic things" ===

Milk's role as a representative of San Francisco's gay community expanded during this period. On September 22, 1975, President [[Gerald Ford]] was visiting San Francisco, walking from his hotel to his car. In the crowd, [[Sara Jane Moore]] raised a gun to shoot him. An ex-[[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] who had been walking by grabbed her arm as the gun discharged toward the pavement.<ref>Shabecoff, Philip (September 23, 1975). "Ford Escapes Harm as Shot is Deflected; Woman Seized with Gun in San Francisco", ''The New York Times'', p. 77.</ref><ref>Melnick, Norman (September 23, 1975). "I was right behind her ... I saw a gun", ''The San Francisco Examiner'', p. 2.</ref> The bystander was [[Oliver Sipple|Oliver "Bill" Sipple]], who had left Milk's ex-lover Joe Campbell years before, prompting his suicide attempt. Sipple, on psychiatric disability leave from the military, lived in the "sleazy" [[Tenderloin, San Francisco, California|Tenderloin]] neighborhood,<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913513,00.html "The Man Who Grabbed the Gun"], ''Time'' (October 6, 1975). Retrieved September 6, 2008.</ref> and the national spotlight was on him immediately. Though Sipple refused to call himself a hero and did not want his sexuality disclosed, Milk told a friend: "It's too good an opportunity. For once we can show that gays do heroic things, not just all that ca-ca [crap] about molesting children and hanging out in bathrooms."<ref>Shilts, p. 122.</ref> Milk contacted the newspaper.<ref name="latimes2/13/89">Morain, Dan (February 13, 1989). "Sorrow Trailed a Veteran Who Saved a President and Then Was Cast in an Unwanted Spotlight", ''The Los Angeles Times'', p. 1.</ref>

Several days later [[Herb Caen]], a columnist at ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'', exposed Sipple as gay and a friend of Milk's. Sipple was besieged by reporters, as was his family. His mother, a staunch [[Baptist]] in Detroit, refused to speak to him. Although he had been involved with the gay community for years, even participating in Gay Pride events, Sipple sued the ''Chronicle'' for invasion of privacy.<ref>Duke, Lynne (December 31, 2006). "Caught in Fate's Trajectory, Along With Gerald Ford", ''The Washington Post'', p. D01.</ref> President Ford sent Sipple a note of thanks for saving his life.<ref name="latimes2/13/89"/> Milk said that Sipple's sexual orientation was the reason he received only a note, rather than an invitation to the [[White House]].<ref name="latimes2/13/89"/><ref group=note>Sipple's case was eventually rejected in 1984 in a California court of appeals. Sipple, who was wounded in the head in Vietnam, was also diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic. He held no ill will toward Milk however, and remained in contact with him. The incident brought him so much attention that, later in life while drinking, he would regret grabbing Moore's gun. Eventually Sipple regained contact with his mother and brother, but was rejected by his father. He kept the letter written by Gerald Ford, framed in his apartment, until he died of pneumonia in 1989.

=== Race for state assembly ===

Keeping his promise to Milk, newly elected Mayor George Moscone appointed him to the Board of Permit Appeals in 1976, making him the first openly gay city commissioner in the United States. Milk, however, considered seeking a position in the [[California State Assembly]]. The district was weighted heavily in his favor, as much of it was based in neighborhoods surrounding Castro Street, where Milk's sympathizers voted. In the previous race for supervisor, Milk received more votes than the currently seated assemblyman. However, Moscone had made a deal with the assembly speaker that another candidate should run<U+2014>[[Art Agnos]].<ref>Shilts, p. 130<U+2013>133.</ref> Furthermore, by order of the mayor, neither appointed nor elected officials were allowed to run a campaign while performing their duties.<ref>"Milk Will Run<U+2014>Loses Permit Board Seat", ''The San Francisco Chronicle'', March 10, 1976.</ref>

Here, Milk (far right) is campaigning with longshoremen in San Francisco during his 1976 race for the [[California State Assembly]].<br /><small>Image credit: [[Daniel Nicoletta]]</small>]]

Milk spent five weeks on the Board of Permit Appeals before Moscone was forced to fire him when he announced he would run for the California State Assembly. Rick Stokes replaced him. Milk's firing, and the backroom deal made between Moscone, the assembly speaker, and Agnos, fueled his campaign as he took on the identity of a political underdog.<ref name="shiltsmachine">Shilts, p. 133<U+2013>137.</ref> He railed that high officers in the city and state governments were against him. He complained that the prevailing gay political establishment, particularly the Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club, were shutting him out; he referred to Jim Foster and Stokes as gay "[[Uncle Tom]]s".<ref name="castroI"/> He enthusiastically embraced a local independent weekly magazine's headline: "Harvey Milk vs. The Machine".<ref name="ewb"/>

His campaign, run from the storefront of Castro Camera, was a study in disorganization. Although volunteers were plentiful and happy to send out mass mailings, Milk's notes and volunteer lists were kept on scrap papers. Any time the campaign required funds, the money came from the cash register without any consideration for accounting.<ref name="shiltsmachine"/> An 11-year-old neighborhood girl joyfully ordered gay men and Irish grandmothers to work on the campaign, despite her mother's discouragement.  Milk himself was hyperactive and prone to fantastic outbursts of temper, only to recover quickly and shout excitedly about something else. Many of his rants were directed at his lover, Scott Smith, who was becoming disillusioned with the man who was no longer the laid-back hippie he had fallen in love with.<ref name="shiltsmachine"/>

If the candidate was manic, he was also dedicated and filled with good humor, and he had a particular genius for getting media attention.<ref>de Jim, p. 43.</ref> He spent long hours registering voters and shaking hands at bus stops and movie theater lines. He took whatever opportunity came along to promote himself. He thoroughly enjoyed campaigning, and his success was evident.<ref name="castroI"/> With the large numbers of volunteers, he had dozens at a time stand along the busy thoroughfare of Market Street as human billboards, holding "Milk for Assembly" signs while commuters drove into the heart of the city to work.<ref>de Jim, p. 44.</ref> He distributed his campaign literature anywhere he could, including among one of the most influential political groups in the city: the [[Peoples Temple]]. Milk's volunteers took thousands of brochures there, but came back with feelings of apprehension. Because the Peoples Temple leader, [[Jim Jones]], was [[Political Alliances of the People's Temple|politically powerful]] in San Francisco (and supported both candidates), Milk allowed Temple members to work his phones, and later spoke at the Temple and defended Jones.<ref group=note>Milk's relationship with the Temple was similar to other politicians' in Northern California. According to ''The San Francisco Examiner'', Jones and his parishioners were a "potent political force", helping to elect Moscone (who appointed him to the Housing Authority), District Attorney Jose Frietas, and Sheriff Richard Hongisto. (Jacobs, John [November 20, 1978]. "S.F.'s Leaders Recall Jones the Politician", ''The San Francisco Examiner'', p. C.) Although Milk spoke at the Temple ("Another Day of Death", ''Time'', December 11, 1978.) and defended Jones in a letter to President [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1978, (Coleman, Loren (2004)., ''The Copycat Effect'', Simon & Schuster, p. 68.), he and his aides deeply distrusted Jones. When Milk learned Jones was backing both him and Art Agnos in 1976, he told friend Michael Wong, "Well fuck him. I'll take his workers, but, that's the game Jim Jones plays." (Shilts, p. 139.)</ref> But to his volunteers, he said, "Make sure you're always nice to the Peoples Temple. If they ask you to do something, do it, and then send them a note thanking them for asking you to do it. They're weird and they're dangerous, and you never want to be on their bad side."<ref>Shilts, p. 139.</ref>  

The race was close, and Milk lost by fewer than 4,000&nbsp;votes.<ref>Shilts, p. 149.</ref> Agnos, however, taught Milk a valuable lesson when he criticized Milk's campaign speeches as "a downer... You talk about how you're gonna throw the bums out, but how are you gonna fix things<U+2014>other than beat me? You shouldn't leave your audience on a down."<ref>Shilts, p. 142<U+2013>143.</ref>

== Broader historical forces ==

The fledgling gay rights movement had yet to meet organized opposition in the U.S. In 1977 a few well-connected gay activists in [[Miami, Florida]] were able to pass a civil rights ordinance that made discrimination based on sexual orientation illegal in [[Miami-Dade County|Dade County]].  A well-organized group of conservative [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]] responded, headed by singer [[Anita Bryant]]. Their campaign was titled "Save Our Children", and Bryant claimed the ordinance infringed her right to teach her children Biblical morality.<ref name="fetner">Fetner, Tina (August 2001). "Working Anita Bryant: The Impact of Christian Anti-Gay Activism on Lesbian and Gay Movement Claims", ''Social Problems'', '''48''' (3), p. 411<U+2013>428. ISSN 0037-7791</ref> Bryant and the campaign gathered 64,000 signatures to put the issue to a county-wide vote. With funds raised in part by the [[Florida Citrus Commission]], for which Bryant was the spokeswoman, they ran television advertisements that contrasted the [[Orange Bowl Parade]] with [[San Francisco Pride|San Francisco's Gay Freedom Day Parade]], stating that Dade County would be turned into a "hotbed of homosexuality" where "men&nbsp;... cavort with little boys".<ref>Clendinen p.&nbsp;303.</ref><ref group=note>Bryant agreed to an interview with ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, in which she was quoted saying that the civil rights ordinance "would have made it mandatory that flaunting homosexuals be hired in both the public and parochial schools&nbsp;... If they're a legitimate minority, then so are nail biters, dieters, fat people, short people, and murderers." ("Playboy Interview: Anita Bryant", ''Playboy'', (May 1978), p.&nbsp;73<U+2013>96, 232<U+2013>250.) Bryant would often break into her standard "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]" while speaking during the campaign, called homosexuals "human garbage", and blamed the drought in California on their sins. (Clendinen, p.&nbsp;306.) As the special election drew near, a Florida state senator read the [[Book of Leviticus]] aloud to the senate, and the governor went on record against the civil rights ordinance. (Duberman, p. 320.)</ref> 

Jim Foster, then the most powerful political organizer in San Francisco, went to Miami to assist gay activists there as election day neared, and a nationwide [[boycott]] of orange juice was organized.  The message of the Save Our Children campaign was influential, and the result was an overwhelming defeat for gay activists; in the largest turnout in any special election in the history of Dade County, 70% voted to repeal the law.<ref>"Miami Anti-gays Win in Landslide", ''The San Francisco Examiner'', (June 8, 1977), p. 1.</ref> 

===Just politics===

Christian conservatives were inspired by their victory, and saw an opportunity for a new, effective political cause. Gay activists were shocked to see how little support they received. An impromptu demonstration of over 3,000 Castro residents formed the night of the Dade County ordinance vote. Gay men and lesbians were simultaneously angry, chanting "Out of the bars and into the streets!", and elated at their passionate and powerful response. ''The San Francisco Examiner'' reported that members of the crowd pulled others out of bars along Castro and Polk Streets to "deafening" cheers.<ref name="sfexam6/8/78"/> Milk led marchers that night on a five-mile (8&nbsp;km) course through the city, constantly moving, aware that if they stopped for too long there would be a riot. He declared, "This is the power of the gay community. Anita's going to create a national gay force."<ref name="sfexam6/8/78">Sharpe, Ivan (June 8, 1977). "Angry Gays March Through S.F.", ''The San Francisco Examiner'', p. 1.</ref><ref>Weiss, p. 105.</ref> Activists had little time to recover, however, as the scenario replayed itself when civil rights ordinances were overturned by voters in [[Minneapolis <U+2013> Saint Paul]], [[Wichita, Kansas]] and [[Eugene, Oregon]], throughout 1977 and into 1978. 

California State Senator [[John Briggs (politician)|John Briggs]] saw an opportunity in the Christian fundamentalists' campaign. He was hoping to be elected governor of California in 1978, and was impressed with the voter turnout he saw in Miami. When Briggs returned to [[Sacramento]], he wrote a bill that would ban gays and lesbians from teaching in public schools throughout California. Briggs claimed in private that he had nothing against gays, telling Randy Shilts, "It's politics. Just politics."<ref>Shilts, p.&nbsp;158.</ref>  Random attacks on gays rose in the Castro. When the police response was considered inadequate, groups of gays patrolled the neighborhood themselves, on alert for attackers.<ref name="hinckle15">Hinckle, p. 15.</ref> On June 21, 1977, a gay man named Robert Hillsborough died from 15 stab wounds while his attackers gathered around him and chanted "Faggot!" Both Mayor Moscone and Hillsborough's mother blamed Anita Bryant and John Briggs.<ref>"Police Press Hunt for Slayers of Gay", ''The San Francisco Examiner'', (June 23, 1977), p. 3.</ref><ref>Clendinen, p. 319.</ref> One week prior to the incident, Briggs had held a press conference at San Francisco City Hall where he called the city a "sexual garbage heap" because of homosexuals.<ref>Hinckle, p. 28.</ref> Weeks later, 250,000&nbsp;people attended the 1977 San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade, the largest attendance at any Gay Pride event to that point.<ref>Miller, p. 403.</ref> 

In November of 1976, voters in San Francisco had decided to reorganize supervisor elections to choose supervisors from neighborhoods instead of voting for them in city-wide ballots. Harvey Milk quickly qualified as the leading candidate in District 5, surrounding Castro Street.<ref>Shilts, p. 166.</ref>

Anita Bryant's vitriol and multiple challenges to gay rights ordinances across the United States fueled gay politics in San Francisco. Seventeen candidates from the Castro District entered the next race for supervisor; more than half of them were gay. ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran an expos<U+00E9> on the veritable invasion of gay people into San Francisco, estimating that the city's gay population was between 100,000 and 200,000 out of a total 750,000.<ref name="Gold11/6/77">Gold, Herbert (November 6, 1977), "A Walk on San Francisco's Gay Side", ''The New York Times'', p.&nbsp;SM17.</ref> The Castro Village Association had grown to 90&nbsp;businesses; the local bank, formerly the smallest branch in the city, had become the largest and was forced to build a wing to accommodate its new customers.<ref>Shilts, p. 174.</ref> Milk biographer Randy Shilts noted that "broader historical forces" were fueling his campaign.<ref>Shilts, p.&nbsp;173.</ref> 

Milk's most successful opponent was the quiet and thoughtful lawyer Rick Stokes, who was backed by the Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club. Stokes had been open about his homosexuality long before Milk had, and had experienced more severe treatment, once hospitalized and forced to endure [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]].<ref>Shilts, p.&nbsp;169<U+2013>170.</ref> Milk, however, was more expressive about the role of gay people and their issues in San Francisco politics. Stokes was quoted saying, "I'm just a businessman who happens to be gay", and expressed the view that any normal person could also be homosexual. Milk's contrasting populist philosophy was relayed to ''The New York Times'': "We don't want sympathetic liberals, we want gays to represent gays ... I represent the gay street people<U+2014>the 14-year-old runaway from San Antonio. We have to make up for hundreds of years of persecution. We have to give hope to that poor runaway kid from San Antonio. They go to the bars because churches are hostile. They need hope! They need a piece of the pie!"<ref name="Gold11/6/77"/> 

Other causes were also important to Milk: he promoted larger and less expensive child care facilities, free public transportation, and the development of a board of civilians to oversee the police.<ref name="scribner"/> He advanced important neighborhood issues at every opportunity. Milk used the same manic campaign tactics as in previous races: human billboards, hours of handshaking, and dozens of speeches calling on gay people to have hope. This time, even ''The San Francisco Chronicle'' endorsed him for supervisor.<ref>Shilts, p. 182.</ref> He won by 30% against sixteen other candidates, and after his victory became apparent, he arrived on Castro Street on the back of his campaign manager's motorcycle<U+2014>escorted by Sheriff Richard Hongisto<U+2014>to a what a newspaper story described as a "tumultuous and moving welcome".<ref>Pogash, Carol (November 9, 1977). "The Night Neighborhoods Came to City Hall", ''The San Francisco Examiner'', p. 3.</ref>

Milk had recently taken a new lover, a young man named Jack Lira, who was frequently drunk in public, and just as often escorted out of political events by Milk's aides.<ref>Shilts, p. 180.</ref> Since the race for the California State Assembly, Milk had been receiving increasingly violent death threats.<ref>Shilts, pp. 184, 204, 223.</ref> Concerned that his raised profile marked him as a target for assassination, he recorded on tape who he wanted to succeed him if he were killed,<ref name="giteck"/> adding: "If a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door".<ref>Hinckle, p. 13<U+2013>14.</ref>

== Supervisor ==

Milk's swearing-in made national headlines, as he became the first openly gay non-incumbent man in the United States to win an election for public office.<ref name="cone1/8/1978">Cone, Russ (January 8, 1978). "Feinstein Board President", ''The San Francisco Examiner'', p. 1.</ref><ref group=note>Two gay politicians were already in office: lesbian Massachusetts State Representative [[Elaine Noble]] and Minnesota State Senator [[Allan Spear]], who had come out after he had been elected and won re-election.</ref> He likened himself to pioneering African American baseball player [[Jackie Robinson]]<ref>"Homosexual on Board Cites Role as Pioneer", ''New York Times'', (November 10, 1977), p. 24.</ref> and walked to City Hall arm in arm with Jack Lira, stating "You can stand around and throw bricks at Silly Hall or you can take it over. Well, here we are."<ref>Shilts, p. 190.</ref> The Castro District was not the only neighborhood to promote someone new to city politics. An unwed mother ([[Carol Ruth Silver]]), a Chinese American ([[Gordon Lau]]), and an African American woman ([[Ella Hill Hutch]]) were all firsts for the city sworn in with Milk, along with [[Dan White|Daniel White]], a former police officer and firefighter, who spoke of how proud he was that his grandmother was able to see him sworn in.<ref name="cone1/8/1978"/><ref name="nyt1/12/78">Ledbetter, Les (January 12, 1978). "San Francisco Legislators Meet in Diversity", ''The New York Times'', p. A14.</ref>

Milk's energy, affinity for pranking, and his unpredictability at times exasperated Board of Supervisors President Dianne Feinstein. In his first meeting with Mayor Moscone, Milk called himself the "number one queen" and dictated to Moscone that he would have to go through Milk instead of the Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club if he wanted the city's gay votes<U+2014>a quarter of San Francisco's voting population.<ref>Weiss, p. 107.</ref> Milk, however, became Moscone's closest ally on the Board of Supervisors.<ref>Shilts, p. 192<U+2013>193.</ref> The biggest targets of Milk's ire were large corporations and real estate developers. He fumed when a parking garage was slated to take the place of homes near the downtown area, and tried to pass a commuter tax so office workers who lived outside the city and drove into work would have to pay for city services they used.<ref>Shilts, p. 194.</ref> Milk was often willing to vote against Feinstein and other more tenured members of the board. Initially he agreed with fellow Supervisor Dan White, whose district was located two miles south of the Castro, that a mental health facility for troubled adolescents should not be placed there in an old convent. However, after Milk learned more about the facility, he decided to switch his vote, ensuring that White would lose his cause<U+2014>one he had championed while campaigning. White did not forget it. He opposed every initiative and issue Milk supported.<ref>Hinckle, p. 48.</ref>  

Milk began his tenure by sponsoring a civil rights bill that outlawed discrimination based on sexual orientation. The ordinance was called the "most stringent and encompassing in the nation", and its passing demonstrated "the growing political power of homosexuals", according to ''The New York Times''.<ref>Ledbetter, Les (March 22, 1978). "Bill on Homosexual Rights Advances in San Francisco", ''The New York Times'', p. A21.</ref> Only Supervisor White voted against it; Mayor Moscone enthusiastically signed it into law with a light blue pen that Milk had given him for the occasion.<ref>Shilts, p. 199.</ref>  

The second bill Milk concentrated on was designed to solve the number one problem according to a recent citywide poll: dog excrement. Within a month of being sworn in, he began to work on a city ordinance to require dog owners to scoop their pets' feces. Dubbed the "pooper scooper law", its authorization by the Board of Supervisors was covered extensively by television and newspapers in San Francisco. Milk's campaign manager called him "a master at figuring out what would get him covered in the newspaper".<ref name="timesdoc">''The Times of Harvey Milk''. Dir. Rob Epstein.  DVD, Pacific Arts, 1984.</ref> He invited the press to [[Duboce Park]] to explain why it was necessary, and while cameras were rolling, stepped in the offending substance apparently by mistake. His staffers, however, knew he had been at the park for an hour before the press conference looking for the right place to walk in front of the cameras.<ref>Shilts, p. 203<U+2013>204.</ref> It earned him the most fan mail of his tenure in politics and went out on national news releases.

Milk and Lira soon split, but Lira called him a few weeks later and demanded Milk come to his apartment. When Milk arrived, he found Lira had hanged himself. Already prone to severe depression, Lira had been upset about the Anita Bryant and John Briggs campaigns.<ref>Shilts, pp. 228, 233.</ref>

=== Briggs Initiative ===
{{See|Briggs Initiative}}
John Briggs was forced to drop out of the 1978 race for California governor, but received enthusiastic support for Proposition 6, dubbed the [[Briggs Initiative]]. The proposed law would have made firing gay teachers<U+2014>and any public school employees who supported gay rights<U+2014>mandatory.  Briggs' messages supporting Proposition 6 were pervasive throughout California, and Harvey Milk attended every event Briggs hosted. Milk campaigned against the bill throughout the state as well,<ref name="vandecarr">VanDeCarr, Paul (November 23, 2003). "Death of dreams: in November 1978, Harvey Milk's murder and the mass suicides at Jonestown nearly broke San Francisco's spirit.", ''The Advocate'', p. 32.</ref> and swore that even if Briggs won California, he would not win San Francisco.<ref>Clendinen, p. 380<U+2013>381.</ref> In their numerous debates, which toward the end had been honed to quick back-and-forth banter, Briggs maintained that homosexual teachers wanted to abuse and recruit children. Milk responded with statistics compiled by law enforcement that provided evidence that [[pedophile]]s identified primarily as heterosexual, and dismissed Briggs' points with one-liner jokes: "If it were true that children mimicked their teachers, you'd sure have a helluva lot more nuns running around".<ref>Shilts, p. 230<U+2013>231.</ref> 

Attendance at Gay Pride marches during the summer of 1978 in Los Angeles and San Francisco swelled. An estimated 250,000 to 375,000 attended San Francisco's Gay Freedom Day Parade; newspapers claimed the higher numbers were due to John Briggs.<ref name="jacobs6/27/78"/> Organizers asked participants to carry signs indicating their hometowns for the cameras, to show how far people came to live in the Castro District. Milk rode in an open car carrying a sign saying "I'm from Woodmere, N.Y."<ref>Shilts, p. 224.</ref> He gave a version of what became his most famous speech, the "Hope Speech", that ''The San Francisco Examiner'' said "ignited the crowd":<ref name="jacobs6/27/78">Jacobs, John (June 26, 1978). "An Ecumenical Alliance on the Serious Side of 'Gay' ", ''The San Francisco Examiner'', p. 3.</ref><blockquote>On this anniversary of [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]], I ask my gay sisters and brothers to make the commitment to fight. For themselves, for their freedom, for their country ... We will not win our rights by staying quietly in our closets ... We are coming out to fight the lies, the myths, the distortions. We are coming out to tell the truths about gays, for I am tired of the conspiracy of silence, so I'm going to talk about it. And I want you to talk about it. You must come out. Come out to your parents, your relatives.<ref>Shilts, p. 224<U+2013>225.</ref></blockquote>

Despite the losses in battles for gay rights across the country that year, he remained optimistic, saying "Even if gays lose in these initiatives, people are still being educated. Because of Anita Bryant and Dade County, the entire country was educated about homosexuality to a greater extent than ever before. The first step is always hostility, and after that you can sit down and talk about it."<ref name="giteck">Giteck, Lenny (November 28, 1978). "Milk Knew He Would Be Assassinated", ''The San Francisco Examiner'', p. 2.</ref>

Citing the potential infringements on individual rights, former governor of California [[Ronald Reagan]] voiced his opposition to the proposition, as did Supervisor Dan White, Governor [[Jerry Brown]], and President [[Jimmy Carter]], in an afterthought following a speech he gave in Sacramento.<ref name="timesdoc"/><ref name="clendinen388-389">Clendinen, p. 388<U+2013>389.</ref> The proposition lost by more than a million votes, astounding gay activists on election night.

On November 10, 1978, ten months after being sworn in, Supervisor White resigned his position on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, claiming that his annual salary of $9,600 was not enough to support his family.<ref name="exam11/11/78">"Mayor Hunts a Successor for White", ''The San Francisco Examiner'', (November 11, 1978), p. 1.</ref> Milk had also felt the pinch of the decrease in income when he and Scott Smith were forced to close Castro Camera a month before.<ref group=note>Feinstein noticed White's financial straits and pointed him toward commercial developers at Pier 39 near [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco, California|Fisherman's Wharf]] where he and his wife set up a walk-up restaurant called The Hot Potato. (Weiss, p. 143<U+2013>146.) [[Gentrification]] in the Castro District was fully apparent in the late 1970s. In Milk's public rants about "bloodsucking" real estate developers, he used his landlord (who was gay) as an example. Not amused, his landlord tripled the rent for the storefront and the apartment above where Milk lived.

Dianne Feinstein heard gunshots, and called the police. She found Milk face down on the floor, shot five times, including twice in the head at close range. Feinstein was shaking so badly she required support from the police chief after identifying both bodies.<ref name="flintwick"/><ref group=note>Though Feinstein was known to carry a handgun in her purse, she became a proponent of gun control.

Within an hour, White called his wife from a nearby diner; she met him at a church and escorted him to turn himself in to the police. Many residents left flowers on the steps of City Hall. That evening, a spontaneous gathering began to form on Castro Street moving toward City Hall in a candlelight vigil. Their numbers were estimated between 25,000 and 40,000, spanning the width of Market Street, extending the mile and a half (2.4&nbsp;km) from Castro Street. The next day, the bodies of Moscone and Milk were brought to the City Hall rotunda where mourners paid their respects.<ref name="nyt11/29/78"/> Six thousand mourners attended a service for Mayor Moscone at St. Mary's Cathedral.

After Milk's vote for the mental health facility in White's district, however, White refused to speak with Milk and only communicated with one of Milk's aides.

=== Trial ===

{{See|Dan White|Twinkie defense}}

Dan White's arrest and trial caused a sensation, and illustrated severe tensions between the liberal population and the city police. The San Francisco Police were mostly working-class Irish descendants who intensely disliked the growing gay immigration, as well as the liberal direction of the city government. After White turned himself in and confessed, he sat in his cell while his former colleagues on the police force told Harvey Milk jokes; police openly wore "Free Dan White" t-shirts in the days after the murder.<ref>Hinckle, p. 17.</ref> An undersheriff for San Francisco later stated, "The more I observed what went on at the jail, the more I began to stop seeing what Dan White did as the act of an individual and began to see it as a political act in a political movement".<ref>Hinckle, p. 27.</ref> White showed no remorse for his actions, and only exhibited vulnerability during an eight-minute call to his mother from jail.<ref>Weiss, p. 273.</ref>   

The seated jury for White's trial were white middle-class San Franciscans who were mostly Catholic; gays and ethnic minorities were excused from the jury pool.<ref>Shilts, p. 308.</ref> The jury was clearly sympathetic to the defendant: some of the members cried when they heard White's tearful recorded confession, at the end of which the interrogator thanked White for his honesty.<ref name="hinckle49">Hinckle, p. 49.</ref> White's defense attorney, Doug Schmidt, argued that he was not responsible for his actions, using the legal defense known as [[diminished capacity]]: "Good people, fine people, with fine backgrounds, simply don't kill people in cold blood".<ref>Shilts, p. 310.</ref> Schmidt tried to prove that White's anguished mental state was a result of manipulation by the politicos in City Hall who had consistently disappointed and confounded him, finally promising to give his job back only to refuse him again.  Schmidt said that White's mental deterioration was demonstrated and exacerbated by his junk food binge the night before the murders, since he was usually known to have been health-food conscious.<ref name="mounts">Mounts, Suzanne (Spring 1999). "Malice Aforethought in California: A History of Legislative Abdication and Judicial Vacillation", ''University of San Francisco Law Review'' (33 U.S.F. L. Rev. 313).</ref> Area newspapers quickly dubbed it the [[Twinkie defense]]. White was acquitted of the murders but found guilty of [[voluntary manslaughter]] of both victims, and he was sentenced to serve seven and two-thirds years. With the sentence reduced for time served and good behavior, he would be released in five.<ref name="weiss403">Weiss, p. 403.</ref> He cried when he heard the verdict.<ref>Shilts, p. 324<U+2013>325.</ref>

Acting Mayor Feinstein, Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver, and Milk's successor Harry Britt condemned the jury's decision. When it was announced over the police radio in the city, someone sang "[[Danny Boy]]" on the police band.<ref>Weiss, p. 405.</ref> A surge of people from the Castro District walked again to City Hall, chanting "Avenge Harvey Milk" and "He got away with murder".<ref name="timesdoc"/><ref name="weiss406-409">Weiss, p. 406<U+2013>409.</ref> Pandemonium rapidly escalated as rocks were hurled at the front doors of the building. Milk's friends and aides tried to stop the destruction, but the mob of more than 3,000 ignored them and lit police cars on fire. They shoved a burning newspaper dispenser through the broken doors of City Hall, then cheered as the flames grew.<ref>Turner, Wallace (May 22, 1979). "Ex-Official Guilty of Manslaughter In Slayings on Coast; 3,000 Protest; Protesters Beat on Doors Ex-Official Guilty of Manslaughter in Coast Slayings Lifelong San Franciscan", ''The New York Times'', p.

That's why this is happening."<ref name="hinckle15"/> The chief of police ordered the police not to retaliate, but to hold their ground.<ref name="weiss406-409"/> The [[White Night riots]], as they became known, lasted several hours. 

Later that evening, several police cruisers filled with officers wearing riot gear arrived at the Elephant Walk Bar on Castro Street. Harvey Milk's [[prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>]] [[Cleve Jones]] and a reporter for the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', Warren Hinckle, watched as officers stormed into the bar and began to beat patrons at random. After a 15-minute melee, they left the bar and struck out at people walking along the street.<ref name="demilio"/><ref>Weiss, p. 414.</ref> The chief of police finally ordered the officers out of the neighborhood. By morning, 61 police officers and 100 rioters and gay residents of the Castro had been hospitalized.<ref>Weiss, p. 410.</ref> Over a million dollars of damage had been done to City Hall, police cruisers, and the Elephant Walk Bar. 

After the verdict, the District Attorney faced a furious gay community to explain what had gone wrong. The prosecutor admitted to feeling sorry for White before the trial, and neglected to ask the interrogator who recorded White's confession (and who was a childhood friend of White's and his police softball team coach) about his biases and the support White received from the police because, he said, he did not want to embarrass the detective in front of his family in court.<ref name="hinckle49"/><ref>Weiss, p. 80<U+2013>81.</ref> Nor did the prosecutor question White's frame of mind, lack of a history of mental illness, or bring into evidence city politics, suggesting that revenge may have been a motive. Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver testified on the last day of the trial that White and Milk were not friendly, yet she had contacted the prosecutor and insisted on testifying. It was the only testimony the jury heard about their strained relationship.<ref>Weiss, p. 377.</ref> The District Attorney blamed the jury who he claimed had been "taken in by the whole emotional aspect of [the] trial".<ref name="weiss403">Weiss, p. 403.</ref>

=== Aftermath ===
Milk's and Moscone's murders and White's trial changed city politics and the California legal system. In 1980 San Francisco ended district supervisor elections, fearing that a Board of Supervisors so divisive would be harmful to the city, and that they had been a factor in the assassinations. A grassroots neighborhood effort to restore district elections in the mid 1990s proved successful, and the city returned to neighborhood representatives in 2000.<ref>Hubbard, Lee (November 7, 1999). "Real Elections Up Next for S.F.", ''The San Francisco Chronicle'', p. SC1.</ref> As a result of Dan White's trial, California voters changed the law to reduce the likelihood of acquittals of accused who knew what they were doing but claimed their capacity was impaired.<ref name="mounts"/>  Diminished capacity was abolished as a defense to a charge, but courts allowed evidence of it when deciding whether to incarcerate, commit, or otherwise punish a convicted defendant.<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/pen/25-29.html California Penal Code Section 25-29], FindLaw (2008). Retrieved on September 9, 2008.</ref> The "Twinkie defense" has entered American mythology, popularly described as a case where a murderer escapes justice because he binged on junk food, simplifying White's lack of political savvy, his relationships with George Moscone and Harvey Milk, and what ''San Francisco Chronicle'' columnist [[Herb Caen]] described as pandemic police "dislike (understatement) of homosexuals".<ref>Pogash, Carol (November 23, 2003). "Myth of the 'Twinkie defense'", ''The San Francisco Chronicle'', p. D1.</ref>

Dan White served a little more than five years for the double murder of Moscone and Milk. On October 22, 1985, a year and a half after his release from prison, White was found dead in a running car in his ex-wife's garage. He was 39&nbsp;years old. His defense attorney told reporters that he had been despondent over the loss of his family, and the situation he had caused, adding "This was a sick man."<ref name="nyt10/22/85">Lindsey, Robert (October 22, 1985).

== Legacy ==
=== Politics ===

Harvey Milk's political career centered on making government responsive to individuals, gay liberation, and the importance of neighborhoods to the city. At the onset of each campaign, an issue was added to Milk's public political philosophy.<ref name="foss">Foss, Karen (1988). "You Have to Give Them Hope", ''Journal of the West'', '''27''' p. 75<U+2013>81. ISSN 0022-5169</ref> His 1973 campaign focused on the first point, that as a small business owner in San Francisco<U+2014>a city dominated by large corporations that had been courted by municipal government<U+2014>his interests were being overlooked because he was not represented by a large financial institution. Although he did not hide the fact that he was gay, it did not become an issue until his race for the California State Assembly in 1976. It was brought to the fore in the supervisor race against Rick Stokes, as it was an extension of his ideas of individual freedom.<ref name="foss"/> 

Milk strongly believed that neighborhoods promoted unity and a small-town experience, and that the Castro should provide services to all its residents. He opposed the closing of an elementary school; even though most gay people in the Castro did not have children, Milk saw his neighborhood having the potential to welcome everyone. He told his aides to concentrate on fixing [[pothole]]s, and boasted that 50 new stop signs had been installed in District 5.<ref name="foss"/> Responding to city residents' largest complaint about living in San Francisco<U+2014>dog feces<U+2014>Milk made it a priority to enact the ordinance requiring dog owners to take care of their pets' droppings. Randy Shilts noted, "some would claim Harvey was a socialist or various other sorts of ideologues, but, in reality, Harvey's political philosophy was never more complicated than the issue of dogshit; government should solve people's basic problems."<ref>Shilts, p. 203.</ref>

Scholar Karen Foss attributes Milk's impact on San Francisco politics to the fact that he was completely unlike anyone else who had held public office in the city. She writes, "Milk happened to be a highly energetic, charismatic figure with a love of theatrics and nothing to lose ... Using laughter, reversal, transcendence, and his insider/outsider status, Milk helped create a climate in which dialogue on issues became possible. He also provided a means to integrate the disparate voices of his various constituencies."<ref name="fossqueer">Foss, Karen. "The Logic of Folly in the Political Campaigns of Harvey Milk", in ''Queer Words, Queer Images'', Jeffrey Ringer, ed. (1994), New York University Press. ISBN 0814774415.</ref> Milk had been a rousing speaker since he began campaigning in 1973, and his oratory skills only improved after he became City Supervisor.<ref name="demilio"/> His most famous talking points became known as the "Hope Speech", which became a staple throughout his political career. It opened with a play on the accusation that gay people recruit impressionable youth into their numbers: "My name is Harvey Milk<U+2014>and I want to recruit you". A version of the Hope Speech that he gave near the end of his life was considered by those who had heard it often to be the best, and the closing the most effective: <blockquote>And the young gay people in the Altoona, Pennsylvanias and the Richmond, Minnesotas who are coming out and hear Anita Bryant in television and her story. The only thing they have to look forward to is hope. And you have to give them hope. Hope for a better world, hope for a better tomorrow, hope for a better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great. Hope that all will be all right. Without hope, not only gays, but the blacks, the seniors, the handicapped, the us'es, the us'es will give up. And if you help elect to the central committee and other offices, more gay people, that gives a green light to all who feel disenfranchised, a green light to move forward. It means hope to a nation that has given up, because if a gay person makes it, the doors are open to everyone.<ref>Shilts, p. 363.</ref></blockquote>

In the last year of his life, Milk emphasized that gay people should be more visible to help to end the discrimination and [[Violence against LGBT people|violence against them]]. Although Milk had not come out to his mother before her death many years before, in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so: <blockquote>I cannot prevent anyone from getting angry, or mad, or frustrated. I can only hope that they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects ... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.<ref name="giteck"/></blockquote>

However, Milk's assassination has become entwined with his political efficacy, partly because he was killed at the zenith of his popularity. Historian Neil Miller writes, "No contemporary American gay leader has yet to achieve in life the stature Milk found in death".<ref name="miller408">Miller, p. 408.</ref> His legacy has become ambiguous; Randy Shilts concludes his biography writing that Milk's success, murder, and the inevitable injustice of White's verdict represented the experience of all gays. Milk's life was "a metaphor for the homosexual experience in America".<ref name="shilts348">Shilts, p. 348.</ref> According to Frances FitzGerald, Milk's legend has been unable to be sustained as no one appeared able to take his place in the years after his death: "The Castro saw him as a martyr but understood his martyrdom as an end rather than a beginning. He had died, and with him a great deal of the Castro's optimism, idealism, and ambition seemed to die as well. The Castro could find no one to take his place in its affections, and possibly wanted no one."<ref name="castroII">FitzGerald, Frances (July 28, 1986). "A Reporter at Large: The Castro<U+2014>II", ''The New Yorker'', p. 44<U+2013>63.</ref> On the 20th anniversary of Milk's death, historian [[John D'Emilio]] said, "The legacy that I think he would want to be remembered for is the imperative to live one's life at all times with integrity".<ref name="cloud20">Cloud, John (November 10, 1998). "Why Milk is Still Fresh: Twenty Years After his Assassination, Harvey Milk Still Has a Lot to Offer the Gay Life", ''The Advocate'', (772) p. 29.</ref> For a political career so short, Cleve Jones attributes more to his assassination than his life: "His murder and the response to it made permanent and unquestionable the full participation of gay and lesbian people in the political process."<ref name="cloud20"/>
