'''Yorkshire and the Humber''' is one of nine official [[regions of England]] at the [[First level NUTS of the European Union|first level]] of [[NUTS of the United Kingdom|NUTS]] for [[Eurostat|statistical]] purposes. It covers most of the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of [[Yorkshire]], along with the part of northern [[Lincolnshire]] that was, from 1974 to 1996, within the former [[shire county]] of [[Humberside]]. The population in 2011 was 5,284,000.<ref name="Region populations">{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_270487.pdf|title=2011 Census - Population and Household Estimates for England and Wales, March 2011|accessdate=2012-07-16|publisher=Office of National Statistics|year=2012|format=PDF}}</ref> The British Government has announced its intention to abolish Government Offices (for the Regions) no later than 31 March 2011.

==Geographical context==
{{Politics of England}}
See [[Topographical areas of Yorkshire]] and [[Geology of Yorkshire]]

===Geology===
In the Yorkshire and the Humber region there is a very close relationship between the major [[topographical]] areas and the underlying geology.<ref name="genukiorg">{{cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/YKS/|publisher=Genuki.org|title=Yorkshire Geology|accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref> The [[Pennine]] chain of hills in the west is of [[Carboniferous]] origin. The central vale is [[Triassic|Permo-Triassic]]. The [[North York Moors]] in the north-east of the county are [[Jurassic]] in age while the [[Yorkshire Wolds]] and [[Lincolnshire Wolds]] to the south east are [[Cretaceous]] chalk uplands.<ref name="genukiorg"/>

===Rivers===
[[File:Yorkshire-Drainage.jpg|170px|thumb|left|The main rivers of Yorkshire.]]
The region is [[drainage|drained]] by several rivers. In western and central Yorkshire the many rivers empty their waters into the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]] which  reaches the [[North Sea]] via the [[Humber Estuary]].<ref name="rivers">{{cite book | year = 1992 | title = Yorkshire Rivers: A Canoeists Guide  | publisher = Menasha Ridge Press | isbn = 978-1-871890-16-7 | author = British Canoe Union, Yorkshire and Humberside Region, Access and Recreation Committees ; prepared by Mike Twiggs and David Taylor. | oclc = 27687324}}</ref>  The most northerly of the rivers in the Ouse system is the [[River Swale]], which drains [[Swaledale]] before passing through [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]] and meandering across the [[Vale of Mowbray]]. Next, draining [[Wensleydale]], is the [[River Ure]], which joins the Swale east of Boroughbridge. The [[River Nidd]] rises on the edge of the [[Yorkshire Dales National Park]] and flows along [[Nidderdale]] before reaching the [[Vale of York]].<ref name="rivers"/>

The Ouse is the name given to the river after its confluence with the Ure at Ouse Gill Beck. The [[River Wharfe]], which drains [[Wharfedale]], joins the Ouse upstream of [[Cawood]].<ref name="rivers"/> The Rivers [[River Aire|Aire]] and [[River Calder, West Yorkshire|Calder]]  are more southerly contributors to the River Ouse and the most southerly Yorkshire tributary is the [[River Don, South Yorkshire|River Don]], which flows northwards to join the main river at [[Goole]]. In the far north of the county the [[River Tees]] flows eastwards through [[Teesdale]] and empties its waters into the North Sea downstream of [[Middlesbrough]]. The smaller [[River Esk, North Yorkshire|River Esk]] flows from west to east at the northern foot of the North York Moors to reach the sea at [[Whitby]].<ref name="rivers"/>

The [[River Derwent, Yorkshire|River Derwent]] rises on the North York Moors, flows south then westwards through the [[Vale of Pickering]] then turns south again to drain the eastern part of the Vale of York. It empties into the River Ouse at [[Barmby on the Marsh]].<ref name="rivers"/>  To the east of the Yorkshire Wolds the [[River Hull]] flows southwards to join the Humber Estuary at [[Kingston upon Hull]]. The western Pennines are served by the [[River Ribble]] which drains westwards into the [[Irish Sea]] close to [[Lytham St Annes]].<ref name="rivers"/>

The highest point of the region is [[Whernside]], in the [[Yorkshire Dales]], at {{convert|737|m|ft}}. The largest freshwater lake is [[Hornsea Mere]] in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]].

===Climate===
This region of [[England]] generally has cool summers and relatively mild winters with the upland areas of the [[North York Moors]] and the [[Pennines]] experiencing the coolest weather and the [[Vale of York]] the warmest. Weather conditions vary from day to day as well as from season to season. The latitude of the area means that it is influenced by predominantly westerly winds with depressions and their associated fronts, bringing with them unsettled and windy weather, particularly in winter. Between depressions there are often small mobile anticyclones that bring periods of fair weather. In winter [[anticyclone]]s bring cold dry weather. In summer the anticyclones tend to bring dry settled conditions which can lead to drought. For its latitude this area is mild in winter and cooler in summer due to the influence of the [[Gulf Stream]] in the northern [[Atlantic Ocean]].

Air temperature varies on a daily and seasonal basis. Cities such as Sheffield, Leeds, and Bradford are generally cooler due to their inland and upland location, while York, Hull, and Wakefield are warmer due to their lowland location. The temperature is usually lower at night and January is the coldest time of the year and July is usually the warmest month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/location/england/ |title=English Climate |accessdate=2008-05-03 |publisher=Met Office |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929090912/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/location/england/ |archivedate = 29 September 2007}}</ref>

Snow is not uncommon in the winter, Yorkshire is mostly hilly/mountainous, and the Yorkshire Dales and the Pennines can experience extreme snowstorms with high snowdrifts. Snow in coastal towns such as Hull and Scarborough are not as common because they are moderated by the ocean, while inland/upland settlements such as Skipton or Ilkley experience more snow.

==Settlements==
[[File:Infirmary Street, Leeds.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leeds]], the largest settlement in the region]]

There are seven [[City status in the United Kingdom|cities]] in Yorkshire and the Humber: [[Bradford]], [[Kingston upon Hull]],  [[Leeds]], [[Ripon]], [[Sheffield]], [[Wakefield]] and [[York]].  There are many other large towns in the area such as [[Doncaster]], [[Grimsby]], [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], [[Huddersfield]]  and [[Scunthorpe]].  Leeds is the largest settlement being the largest part of an urban area with a population of 1.5 million.  Leeds is now one of the largest financial centres in the United Kingdom.  Sheffield is the second largest settlement and is a large manufacturing centre.  Bradford is the third largest city and was traditionally a textile city, the decline of these industries has left Bradford's economy more diverse.  Kingston upon Hull is the main port in the region and also a notable fishing harbour.  While cities such as Bradford, Leeds and Sheffield grew during the industrial revolution, there are older cities in the region such as Wakefield and York.

The [[List of tallest buildings in Yorkshire|tallest occupied building in Yorkshire]] is [[Bridgewater Place]] in central Leeds, commonly referred to as ''The [[Dalek]]'', and at 361 feet is the 34th tallest building in the UK, built in 2007. The 37 storey [[Sky Plaza]] in Leeds is the world's second tallest student accommodation building at 338 feet, and the second tallest building in the region, and the UK's 42nd tallest building, built in 2009. The 32-storey [[St Pauls Tower]] is now the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in Sheffield|tallest building in Sheffield]] at 331 feet. The [[Royal Hallamshire Hospital]] is the tallest hospital in the UK outside of London at 249 feet, and was built in 1979.

==History==
It was originally called '''Yorkshire and Humberside''', and defined as [[North Yorkshire]], [[West Yorkshire]], [[South Yorkshire]] and [[Humberside]]. Since then, Humberside has been abolished, and the councils of West and South Yorkshire abolished.  The older form of the name is still occasionally seen.

===Industrial history===
[[Stainless steel]] was invented in 1913 by [[Harry Brearley]] of Sheffield, working for [[Firth Brown Steels]] (now called [[Sheffield Forgemasters]]). [[Crucible steel]] had been invented in the 1740s by [[Benjamin Huntsman]] of [[Epworth]] in [[Lincolnshire]] (part of the region).

===Scientific heritage===
[[John Harrison]] of [[Barrow upon Humber]] (but born in Yorkshire at [[Foulby]]), invented the [[marine chronometer]] which allowed [[longitude]] to be accurately measured, and hence navigation at sea. This allowed Captain [[James Cook]] of Whitby to colonise much of Australia. Harrison also invented the [[bimetallic strip]] and the [[Rolling-element bearing|rolling bearing]], without which most vehicles could not move. [[Fred Hoyle]] was an important physicist from [[Bingley]], who discovered how stars [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|made chemical elements]].

===Culture===
The area is well known for its brass bands, with the [[Brighouse and Rastrick Brass Band]], [[Black Dyke Band]], [[Grimethorpe Colliery Band]], [[Carlton Main Frickley Colliery Band]], [[Rothwell Temperance Band]] and [[Hammonds Saltaire Band]]. [[Brass band (British style)|Brass band]]s have mostly been linked with coal mines.

The [[Bront<U+00EB> family]] are the region's best known authors. The region's most popular city for tourists is York.

==Regional assembly==
[[File:Wakefield - Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wakefield Cathedral]]]]
The [[Yorkshire and Humber Assembly]] was a partnership of all local authorities in the region and representatives of various economic, social and environmental sectors. The full Assembly normally met three times a year, normally in February, June and October.
<blockquote>
The full Assembly is responsible for providing regional leadership, agreeing regional strategic priorities, directing the development of the Integrated Regional Framework and endorsing key regional strategies. Membership comprises all 22 local authorities in this region, plus 15 Social, Economic and Environmental partners, and the National Parks for planning purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yhassembly.gov.uk/About%20Us/What%20is%20the%20Assembly%20and%20how%20does%20it%20work/ |title=What is the Assembly and how does it work? |accessdate=2008-05-12 }}</ref>
</blockquote>

On 31 March 2009, the Assembly was abolished and replaced by [[Local Government Yorkshire and Humber]], which continues to be based in the former Assembly premises in King Street in [[Wakefield]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/features/The-short-life-and-changing.5124376.jp|title=The short life and changing times of a people's parliament that never was|last=Smithard |first=Tom|date=2009-03-31|work=Yorkshire Post|publisher=Johnston Press Digital Publishing |accessdate=2010-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yhassembly.gov.uk/ |title=Yorkshire and Humber Assembly |accessdate=2008-05-12 }}</ref>

Yorkshire is one of the two regions (along with the [[North West England|North West]]) that were expected to have a referendum about the establishment of an elected [[Regional Assemblies in England|regional assembly]]. When the [[North East England|North East]] region of England rejected having an elected regional assembly in a referendum, the then [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[John Prescott]]  announced that he would not move orders for [[Northern England devolution referendums, 2004|other referendums]] before the relevant provisions expired in June 2005.

==European Parliament==
{{Main|Yorkshire and the Humber (European Parliament constituency)}}
The European constituency of [[Yorkshire and the Humber (European Parliament constituency)|Yorkshire and the Humber]] is coterminous with the English region. After the [[European Parliament election, 2009|European Parliament election]] in June 2009, Yorkshire and the Humber is represented by one [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] (previously two one now Liberal Democrat), one [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], one [[United Kingdom Independence Party|UKIP]], two [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] (one formerly Conservative) and one [[British National Party|BNP]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]].  It is one of two regions in the UK to have elected an MEP from the BNP.<ref>

The region has fewer degree-educated adults than the England average. The region has the UK's highest rate of cancer.

===Teenage pregnancy===
For top-tier authorities, Kingston upon Hull has the highest [[Teenage pregnancy and sexual health in the United Kingdom|teenage pregnancy]] rate, closely followed by [[North East Lincolnshire]]. For top-tier authorities, [[North Yorkshire]] has the lowest teenage pregnancy rate. For council districts, [[Ryedale]] has the lowest rate, closely followed by [[Craven]]. Only North Yorkshire has council districts in the region.

Rotherham had the UK's youngest grandmother - 26 years old. Her 12 year old daughter gave birth on 26 August 1999.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/432463.stm Britain's youngest grandmother]</ref>

===Social deprivation===
For [[Multiple deprivation index|multiple deprivation]] in England, measured by the [[Indices of deprivation 2007]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/communities/pdf/576659.pdf |title=LSOA deprivation data |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-12-29}}</ref> the most deprived council districts in the region are, in descending order - Kingston upon Hull (11th in England), Bradford (32nd), Doncaster (41st), Barnsley (43rd), North East Lincolnshire (49th), Sheffield (63rd), Wakefield (66th), Rotherham (68th), Kirklees (82nd), Leeds (85th), and Scarborough (97th). These areas are mostly represented by Labour MPs, with a few Conservative MPs representing parts of Leeds (with a Lib Dem MP) and North East Lincolnshire, and all of Scarborough. Apart from Scarborough, they are unitary authorities.

The least deprived districts are, in descending order - Harrogate, Hambleton, Richmondshire, Craven, and Selby - all in North Yorkshire. Like all of North Yorkshire, they are represented by Conservative MPs. At county level, the least deprived areas are, in descending order - North Yorkshire, York and the East Riding of Yorkshire which all have roughly the same level of deprivation, and lower than the majority of England, including [[Cheshire]] and [[Northamptonshire]].

The region as a whole is one of the more deprived in England, measured by having far more [[Super Output Areas|Lower Layer Super Output Areas]] (LSOAs) in the 20% most deprived districts than the 20% least deprived districts.

Kingston upon Hull has the highest proportion of [[NEET]]s in the region (and fairly high for the UK - 10.6%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oneplace.audit-commission.gov.uk/infobyarea/region/area/areaperformanceindicators/areapriorityperformanceindicators/pages/priorityperformanceindicatorperformance.aspx?region=56&area=367&Gkey=282VqIaaVSJtHqsqtGzO9YO7R23XJ3ja7MCpPqD4IW8rtnReSYIM9g%3d%3d&GEARSEntId=2660-AC |title=Audito Commission Hull NEETs |publisher=Oneplace.audit-commission.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=The Committee Office, House of Commons |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmchilsch/316/31606.htm |title=NEETs in the UK |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=2010-04-08 |accessdate=2010-12-29}}</ref> This is another demographic extreme it shares with [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley|Knowsley]] in Merseyside.

In March 2011 the region had the third highest overall [[Jobseeker's Allowance|unemployment claimant]] count in England with 4.4%. For the region, Hull has the highest rate with 7.8% which is the highest for any English district; [[North East Lincolnshire]] is next with 6.4%, and Doncaster has 5.2%. [[Richmondshire]] has the lowest rate with 1.8% and Harrogate is next lowest with 1.9%.<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/elmr/downloads/Table6-18.xls Claimant count]</ref>

===Elections===
In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], the region was evenly split between Labour and Conservative; 35% of the region's electorate voted Labour, 33% Conservative and 23% Liberal Democrat.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/region/12.stm|title=UK > England >Yorkshire & the Humber|date=7 May 2010|work=Election 2010|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref> However Labour have almost twice as many seats than the Conservatives with 32 Labour, 18 Conservative and 3 Liberal Democrat. The Conservatives gained 10 seats, with the other two parties losing seats; there was a 6.6% swing from Labour to Conservative. However although Labour has around 60% of the region's seats, the geographic spread is mostly Conservative, due to the Labour seats having a much smaller geographic area. All of [[South Yorkshire]] is Labour apart from the Liberal seat of [[Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Hallam]] (the least deprived area of South Yorkshire), and Labour is concentrated in the other coalfield areas and Hull.

[[File:Ouse Motorway Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|M62 [[Ouse Bridge]], built in 1976]]
As part of the national transport planning system, the [[Regional Assemblies in England|Regional Assembly]] is required to produce a [[Regional Transport Strategy (UK)|Regional Transport Strategy (RTS)]] to provide long term planning for transport in the region. This involves region wide transport schemes such as those carried out by the [[Highways Agency]] and [[Network Rail]].<ref name=GoYH1>

===Road===
<!--*Regionwide-->[[File:Map of the M62 motorway - section.svg|thumb|right|The M62's route in relation to the four major cities it serves: Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and Hull.]]
The [[M62 motorway]] is Yorkshire's main east-west thoroughfare, and north-south routes are the [[M1 motorway|M1]] and the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]], with only the A1 continuing further north, with an upgrade to motorway status currently being built between [[Dishforth]] and [[Leeming, North Yorkshire|Leeming]]. The other main north-south road in the region is the [[A19 road|A19]].<ref name="patlas">{{cite book|title=Philips Motoring Atlas:Britain|publisher=Philips|location=London|year=2005}}</ref> The [[M180 motorway|M180]] (continuing as the A180) connects the ports at Grimsby and Immingham via the [[M18 motorway (Great Britain)|M18]] ([[European route E22]]).

The [[A64 road|A64]] road connects areas in the North East of the region to the main body of motorways. The M1 was originally designed to finish at the A1 at Doncaster; this section became the M18. The section from the [[Thurcroft Interchange]] to Leeds was essentially designed to replace the [[A61 road|A61]], which is still the main road that connects the centres of Sheffield, Barnsley, Wakefield and Leeds, and continues through Harrogate and Ripon to Thirsk. The M180 is shadowed by the [[A18 road (England)|A18]], which is the main road through Scunthorpe. The single-carriageway [[A1079 road|A1079]] connects Hull to York, and has been exceeding its designed capacity for many years.

The main north-south and east-west routes interchange at a series of junctions to the south and east of Leeds, near Castleford. Leeds and Bradford have inner-city urban motorways, while Sheffield has the [[Sheffield Parkway]] and Hull has the ''Clive Sullivan Way'' ([[A63 road|A63]]) which connect the city centres with the motorway network.  Leeds has an inner-ring road network made mostly out of purpose-built motorway stretches which is mostly sub-terrain to the north of the city centre. Bradford, Huddersfield, Sheffield and York have inner-ring roads made by re-aligning existing roads while Halifax has a town-centre relief scheme made up of the Aachen Way and the North Bridge flyovers.

The [[Humber Bridge]], the tallest bridge in the UK at 538 feet, was the world's longest suspension bridge from 17 July 1981 until 5 April 1998. It was built to connect with a proposed new town near the [[A15 road (England)|A15]]/M180 interchange.

===Rail===
[[File:Overview of Leeds City railway station 04.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leeds City railway station]] is the busiest in the region.]]
The central hubs of the rail network in the region are [[Leeds City railway station|Leeds]], [[Sheffield railway station|Sheffield]] and [[York railway station|York]]. The [[East Coast Main Line]] passes through [[Leeds]] and [[York]], operated by [[East Coast (train operating company)|East Coast]] which is based in York, and the UK's only state-owned train company. The [[Midland Main Line]] finishes at [[Sheffield]], with a less regular service to Leeds, operated by [[East Midlands Trains]]. East-west routes are the [[North TransPennine]] to [[Manchester Piccadilly station|Manchester]], and [[South TransPennine]] through [[Doncaster railway station|Doncaster]].<ref>

</ref>  Leeds has a fairly extensive commuter network and an electrified section in the North of Bradford provides many commuter services. Sheffield has a smaller commuter rail network and there are also less extensive systems in Doncaster, Huddersfield, Wakefield and Harrogate, which connect the districts of the settlements to the centre by rail. The express service between Leeds and Huddersfield is notably quick.

[[South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive|SYPTE]] and [[West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive|WYPTE]] subsidise commuters' travel with discount schemes. [[Tram-train]]s have also been proposed in the area, however no scheme has yet been approved.

Hull is now connected to the capital with its much-improved [[First Hull Trains]] service. North Yorkshire has a skeleton train network, with Scarborough and York being the main destinations. The [[Yorkshire Coast Line]] connects [[Hull Paragon Interchange|Hull]] to [[Scarborough railway station|Scarborough]]. The [[Hull to York Line]] runs along the north of the Humber through [[Selby railway station|Selby]], and takes in [[Sherburn-in-Elmet railway station|Sherburn-in-Elmet]] and nearby rural stations south of York, being of great use to commuters to York since being reopened in the 1980s.

[[Image:A HST heads North to York - geograph.org.uk - 330481.jpg|thumb|140px|left|The HST set the current [[Land speed record for rail vehicles|world speed record]] for diesel trains near Thirsk in 1987]]
South of the Humber, [[Scunthorpe railway station|Scunthorpe]] and nearby rural stations are connected by a branch of the main [[Sheffield to Hull Line]] (through Doncaster), via the branch from [[Hatfield and Stainforth railway station|Hatfield and Stainforth]], run by [[Northern Rail]]. [[Grimsby Town railway station|Grimsby]] is connected (also through Scunthorpe) on [[First TransPennine Express]]'s South TransPennine route from Sheffield (originating at [[Manchester Airport railway station|Manchester Airport]]).

<!-- *West Yorkshire
* The East Riding of Yorkshire
* North Yorkshire
* South Yorkshire
* Lincolnshire -->

The region is home to a rail land speed record. On 1 November 1987, a British Rail [[British Rail Class 43 (HST)|HST]] travelled at 238 km/h between [[Northallerton railway station|Northallerton]] and [[Thirsk railway station|Thirsk]]. The train consisted of [[power car]]s 43102 (''City of Wakefield'')<ref>[http://www.flickr.com/photos/blackwatch55013/4728488978/in/photostream City of Wakefield train]</ref> and 43159, and three [[British Rail Mark 3|Mark 3]] carriages. This is the world speed record for [[Diesel locomotive|diesel train]]s, which used the [[Paxman Valenta]] engine.<ref>[http://www.traintesting.com/ic225_6.htm HST record]</ref>

===Mass transit===
[[Image:Sheffield tram at Hillsborough - geograph.org.uk - 811984.jpg|thumb|right|Sheffield Supertram in 1998]]
Only Sheffield has its own mass-transit system, the [[Supertram (Sheffield)|Supertram]], owned by SYPTE and run by [[Stagecoach Sheffield|Stagecoach]]. Leeds and Bradford have more developed commuter rail systems but lack any mass transit system.  The [[Leeds Supertram]] was an approved scheme in Leeds, however the funding was pulled and the scheme has been replaced by the proposed [[Leeds Trolleybus]] scheme.  In the past Bradford, Huddersfield, Kingston upon Hull, Leeds, Rotherham, Sheffield and York have all had mass-transit systems.

===Air===
[[File:Leeds Bradford International Airport terminal, left.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leeds Bradford International Airport]] is the busiest in the region.]]
Airports in the region are [[Leeds Bradford International Airport]] at [[Yeadon, West Yorkshire|Yeadon]], [[Robin Hood Airport Doncaster Sheffield]] (which opened in April 2005 on the former [[RAF Finningley]]) near [[Doncaster]] and [[Humberside Airport]] (which opened in April 1974 on the former [[RAF Kirmington]]) near [[Brigg]] in [[North Lincolnshire]].  Leeds Bradford International Airport is the largest in the region by passenger numbers, Robin Hood boasts the longest runway (2.7 km) of any airport in the region and Humberside Airport boasts an active heliport.

[[Sheffield City Airport & Heliport|Sheffield Airport]] formerly served the city of Sheffield, however the airport struggled to attract many scheduled services and closed following the opening of Robin Hood Doncaster Sheffield Airport.

Lying outside of the region [[Durham Tees Valley Airport]] (former [[RAF Middleton St. George]]) serves the northernmost areas of the region, being next to the River Tees, and less than a mile from [[Over Dinsdale]] on [[North Yorkshire]]'s northern edge. There are day and night [[First TransPennine Express|direct rail connections]] from the region to [[Manchester Airport]].<ref>

</ref>  Hull also has a large freight port and an active fishing port.  [[Immingham]] carries much freight transport via [[DFDS Tor Line]] and the [[Stena Line]].  [[Goole]] is Britain's most inland port and is used mostly for importing commodities such as [[coal]] and [[timber]].

The region also has a canal network.  The [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] links West Yorkshire with the North West and the [[Aire and Calder Navigation]] links Leeds and the coal fields of West and North Yorkshire with the ports to the East of the region.  There are also several smaller canals in the region, often built for quite specific purposes.  Many stretches of the smaller canals in the region have been backfilled.

[[NHS Yorkshire and the Humber]], the regional [[NHS strategic health authority|strategic health authority]], is at the roundabout at the bottom of ''Kirkstall Road'' in Leeds, with another office ion the north of Sheffield. The charity-funded [[Yorkshire Air Ambulance]] is based at [[Leeds Bradford International Airport|Leeds Bradford Airport]] and [[Bagby]], near [[Thirsk]]. The state-funded [[Yorkshire Ambulance Service]] is based next to Coca-Cola on the Wakefield 41 Business Park, near the A650.

Yorkshire in the past has been synonymous with [[Coal mining in the United Kingdom|coal mining]]. Many pits closed in the 1990s, with only two in the Pontefract area left at [[Kellingley Colliery|Kellingley]] and [[Sharlston, West Yorkshire|Sharlston]]. In South Yorkshire, there is [[Maltby Main Colliery]] and [[Hatfield Colliery]] at [[Stainforth, South Yorkshire|Stainforth]]. The [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|NUM]] was very Yorkshire-dominated. Coal still plays a part in the economy - there are three large power stations along the [[River Aire|Aire]] Valley, with [[Drax Power Station|Drax]] being the second largest in Europe with 3,945&nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]] of capacity. The [[Electricity distribution|distribution]] [[Distribution Network Operator|area]] once looked after by the [[Regional Electricity Companies|regional electricity company]] [[Yorkshire Electricity]] is now looked after by YEDL, owned by [[CE Electric UK]].

There are around 235,000 at the region's secondary schools, the 4th lowest for English regions. The region has the highest overall [[truancy]] rate in England for both urban and rural areas. Inside the region for districts, Leeds has the highest rate with 6.9% persistent truants at secondary school, then Hull is second with 6.3%. Calderdale has the lowest truancy rate for unitary authorities, almost half that of Leeds, followed by [[North Lincolnshire]]. For districts [[Craven]] has the lowest rate.

The schools in Hull have often performed among the worst (on average) in England at [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]]<ref>

</ref> after [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley|Knowsley]] in Merseyside. To Hull's credit, three schools in its LEA get above-average GCSE results whereas Knowsley usually has none (it managed two in 2010). Also at GCSE, schools in Barnsley and Bradford have low-achieving results with Barnsley the worst of these, and the lowest in the region in 2010. All three of these areas coincidentally have an above-average [[Teenage pregnancy and sexual health in the United Kingdom|teenage pregnancy]] problem. In past years, Doncaster would be included in this group, but has managed to perform much better. For the metropolitan areas, Calderdale and Wakefield consistently perform the best, with both above the England average. Rotherham usually has the best results in South Yorkshire, but in 2010 it was Doncaster. York and North Yorkshire consistently perform the best at GCSE in the region, and with the East Riding of Yorkshire have results above the UK average.

Schoolchildren in Kingston upon Hull are most likely not to pass any GCSEs - over 6% with Bradford having a similar proportion, closely followed by Sheffield and North East Lincolnshire. The East Riding of Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire have the fewest not passing any GCSEs, followed by York.

For OFSTED inspections across England, the region has the highest proportion of schools (2.7%) with bad behaviour and the lowest proportion (16.3%) of schools with good behaviour. [[South West England]] has the best behaving schoolchildren. Inside the region, Hull has the highest proportion (16.7%) of schools with bad behaviour - the worst in England (Wandsworth and Bristol come joint second) - and York schools have the highest proportion (30%) of schools with outstanding behaviour.

At [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]] North Lincolnshire, Kirklees, Hull, York and North Yorkshire perform quite well with Kirklees consistently being the best by a large margin and one of the highest in England, all having results above the England average. Wakefield and Calderdale were also close to the England average. The excellent Kirklees result is due to Greenhead College in Huddersfield, and North Lincolnshire's results are due to the [[John Leggott College]], also a [[sixth form college]]. The districts of South Yorkshire perform the least in the area at A-level with Rotherham having the best results in this area, slightly below-average, and the other three districts achieve similar results, much lower than those in the former districts of Humberside. Leeds and Bradford now get the lowest results in West Yorkshire.

For both A-level and GCSE, Barnsley and Bradford are very low performing, with Barnsley usually getting the lowest A-level results in the region, but in 2010 North East Lincolnshire came bottom with unusually low results. Hull and northern Lincolnshire have a wide socio-economic diversity &ndash; many under-achieving pupils at 16 but with high performers at A-level. Hull, although much worse at GCSE, outperforms the East Riding of Yorkshire at A-level.<ref>

School children in North Yorkshire (with York and Kirklees) are the most likely to go to university - they also get the best A level results, and those in the East Riding of Yorkshire are likely to go to university, but get lower overall A level results.

There are nine universities and three higher education colleges in Yorkshire and the Humber, along with (in 2007) 27 Further Education colleges teaching some Higher Education courses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/hefce/2007/07_18/outputYH.pdf |title=HEFCE |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-12-29}}</ref>

The [[Citric acid cycle|Krebs Cycle]] was discovered at the [[University of Sheffield]] in 1937. [[Liquid crystal display]]s were developed by the [[University of Hull]] in 1972, in conjunction with the [[Royal Radar Establishment]] in [[Worcestershire]]. Low fat spreads were developed at the [[University of Leeds]] (in conjunction with [[Unilever]]) in the [[1980s]], and in the 1930s [[William Astbury]]'s [[X-ray scattering techniques|x-ray diffraction]] experiments at the university started the road to the discovery of the double helix structure.

The University of Leeds is the largest in the region with 33,000 students, and has the most funding, especially for research. The University of Sheffield is not too far behind, with similar amounts spent on research. The University of York, a large campus similar to a [[collegiate university]], gets much less funding than Leeds and Sheffield, but has quite a high research grant for its size, about half that of Leeds or Sheffield. The other universities do not have large research grants. Leeds and Sheffield have around twice as much total income than any other university. York and Bradford are the two smallest universities.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}<!-- whole para needs sources -->

For first degree students at universities in the region, 27% are native to the region, 16% are from [[North West England]] and 11% from the [[East Midlands]]; 48% are from Northern England and around 25% from Southern England.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Access to the M62 determines the regions from which the region's universities' students originate from - the nearer there are to the motorway the easier it is to study in the Yorkshire and Humberside region.{{Clarify|date=March 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} For first degree students native to the region, 43% stay in the region, 16% go to the North West, 11% to the North East and 11% to the [[East Midlands]]; just under 10% go to [[Southern England]], with 70% staying in [[Northern England]].

Once graduated, 53% of the region's universities' graduates (native and non-native) stay to find work in the region, with around 10% moving to the North West (Manchester); 70% stay in Northern England, with 20% going to Southern England.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
