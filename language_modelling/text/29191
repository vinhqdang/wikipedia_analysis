The '''effects of Hurricane Isabel in Delaware''' resulted in one of only twelve presidential disaster declarations for the state of [[Delaware]]. [[Hurricane Isabel]] formed from a [[tropical wave]] on September 6, 2003 in the tropical [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165&nbsp;mph (265&nbsp;km/h) on September 11. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] with winds of 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land and became [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] over [[Pennsylvania]] the next day. The storm's center remained to the south and west of Delaware, and was about 175&nbsp;miles (280&nbsp;km) from Delaware at its closest approach. At that time, Isabel was a strong tropical storm located in central [[Virginia]].<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Jack Beven & Hugh Cobb|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=2006-11-15|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003isabel.shtml?}}</ref>

The effects of the hurricane were compounded by flooding caused by the remnants of [[Tropical Storm Henri (2003)|Tropical Storm Henri]] days before. Moderate winds of up to 62&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) downed numerous trees, tree limbs, and power lines across the state, leaving at least 15,300 without power. Numerous low-lying areas were flooded due to high surf, strong storm surge, or run-off from flooding further inland. The passage of Hurricane Isabel resulted in $40&nbsp;million in damage (2003&nbsp;USD, (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|40000000|2003|r=2}}}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD) and no casualties in the state.

On September 16, 44&nbsp;hours before Hurricane Isabel made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, the [[National Hurricane Center]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm watch]] for the entire coastline of Delaware. The National Hurricane Center also briefly issued a hurricane watch for the coastline. On September 17, 26&nbsp;hours before Isabel made landfall, the watches were changed to tropical storm warnings.<ref name="tcr"/> While over the western Atlantic Ocean as a [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category 5 hurricane]], forecasters predicted Isabel would move northwestward and within five days be at a position 155&nbsp;miles (250&nbsp;km) south-southeast of [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes]] as a 115&nbsp;mph (185&nbsp;km/h) major hurricane.<ref name="lawrence32">{{cite web|author=Lawrence|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Discussion Thirty-Two|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-11-15|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/dis/al132003.discus.032.shtml?}}</ref> Though located within the [[1-2-3 rule|cone of uncertainty]], all subsequent forecasts predicted a landfall on North Carolina with the hurricane passing to the west of the state.<ref name="isabelarchive">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Advisory Archive|accessdate=2006-12-24|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/ISABEL.shtml?}}</ref>

==Impact==

Strong swells from the hurricane produced a moderate [[storm surge]] which peaked at 8.66&nbsp;feet (2.64&nbsp;m) in [[Reedy Point, Delaware|Reedy Point]].<ref name="tcr"/> Tides were only slightly above normal, though high surf on top of the storm surge resulted in beach erosion,<ref name="ncdc">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=2003|title=Event Report for Delaware|accessdate=2006-12-24|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~494483}}</ref> particularly in Sussex County.<ref name="phil"/> Waves of 17&nbsp;feet (5.18&nbsp;m) in height were reported near the coastline.<ref name="isabel1"/> The high waters breached dunes south of [[Bethany Beach, Delaware|Bethany Beach]], and several locations along [[Delaware Route 1]] were flooded.<ref name="ncdc"/> The large circulation of Isabel produced gusty winds across the state, including a maximum of 70&nbsp;mph (113&nbsp;km/h) in [[Delaware Pilot Tower]] in the [[Delaware Bay]].

A total of 35 power crews, along with outside contractors, worked to restore power. By two days after the storm, 2,000 remained without power in scattered areas.<ref name="wrap"/> Various locations in the city of Dover were without power for about 30&nbsp;hours. There, the removal of debris exceeded the capacity of the local landfall, resulting in officials temporarily storing it elsewhere.<ref name="dover"/> Over 200&nbsp;volunteers donated time, food and money to provide hot meals for individuals and families affected by the storm.
