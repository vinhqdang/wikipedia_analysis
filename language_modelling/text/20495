'''''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon''''' is a 2000 ''[[wuxia]]'' film. An American-Chinese-Hong Kong-Taiwanese co-production, the film was directed by [[Ang Lee]] and featured an international cast of ethnic Chinese actors, including [[Chow Yun-Fat]], [[Michelle Yeoh]], [[Zhang Ziyi]], and [[Chang Chen]]. The film was based on [[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (novel)|the fourth novel]] in a [[pentalogy]], known in China as the ''[[Crane Iron Pentalogy]]'', by ''wuxia'' novelist [[Wang Dulu]]. The martial arts and [[Stage combat|action sequences]] were choreographed by [[Yuen Wo Ping]].

Made on a mere US$17&nbsp;million budget, with dialogue in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' became a surprise international success, grossing $213.5&nbsp;million. It grossed US$128&nbsp;million in the United States, becoming the highest-grossing foreign-language film in American history. It has won over 40 awards. The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] (Taiwan) and three other Academy Awards, and was nominated for six other Academy Awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].<ref name="mojo">[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/oscar/movies/?id=crouchingtigerhiddendragon.htm Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]. ''Box Office Mojo''. Accessed December 30, 2006.</ref> The film also won four [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]]s and two [[Golden Globe Award]]s, one for Best Foreign Film. Along with its awards success, ''Crouching Tiger'' continues to be hailed as one of the greatest and most influential foreign language films in the [[United States of America|United States]], especially coming out of [[People's Republic of China|China]]. It has been praised for its [[martial arts]] sequences, story, and [[cinematography]].

==Plot==
The film is set in the [[Qing Dynasty]] during the 43rd year (1779) of the reign of the [[Qianlong Emperor]]. Li Mu Bai ([[Chow Yun-Fat]]) is an accomplished [[Wudang Sect|Wudang]] swordsman. Long ago, his master was murdered by Jade Fox ([[Cheng Pei-pei]]), a woman who sought to learn Wudang skills. Mu Bai is also a good friend of Yu Shu Lien ([[Michelle Yeoh]]), a female warrior. Mu Bai and Shu Lien have developed feelings for each other, but they have never acknowledged or acted on them. Mu Bai, intending to give up his warrior life, asks Shu Lien to transport his sword, also referred to as the ''Green Destiny'', to the city of [[Peking]], as a gift for their friend Sir Te ([[Sihung Lung]]). At Sir Te's estate, Shu Lien meets Jen ([[Zhang Ziyi]]), the daughter of Governor Yu (Li Fazeng), a visiting [[Manchu]] aristocrat. Jen, destined for an arranged marriage and yearning for adventure, seems envious of Shu Lien's warrior lifestyle. 

One evening, a masked thief sneaks into Sir Te's estate and steals the sword. Mu Bai and Shu Lien trace the theft to Governor Yu's compound and learn that Jade Fox has been posing as Jen's governess for many years. Mu Bai makes the acquaintance of Inspector Tsai (Wang Deming), a police investigator from the provinces, and his daughter May (Li Li), who have come to Peking in pursuit of Fox. Fox challenges the pair and Sir Te's servant Master Bo (Gao Xi'an) to a showdown that night. Following a protracted battle, the group is on the verge of defeat when Mu Bai arrives and outmaneuvers Fox. Before Mu Bai can kill Fox, the masked thief reappears and partners with Fox to fight. Fox resumes the fight and kills Tsai before fleeing with the thief (who is revealed to be Fox's proteg<U+00E9>e, Jen). After seeing Jen fight Mu Bai, Fox realizes Jen had been secretly studying the Wudang manual and has surpassed her in skill.

At night, a desert bandit named Lo ([[Chang Chen]]) breaks into Jen's bedroom and asks her to leave with him. A [[flashback (continuity)|flashback]] reveals that in the past, when Governor Yu and his family were traveling in the western deserts, Lo and his bandits had raided Jen's caravan and Lo had stolen her comb. She chased after him, following him to his desert cave seemingly in a quest to get her comb back. However, the pair soon fell passionately in love. Lo eventually convinced Jen to return to her family, though not before telling her a legend of a man who jumped off a cliff to make his wishes come true. Because the man's heart was pure, he did not die. Lo came to Peking to persuade Jen not to go through with her arranged marriage.  However, Jen refuses to leave with him. Later, Lo interrupts Jen's wedding procession, begging her to come away with him. Nearby, Shu Lien and Mu Bai convince Lo to wait for Jen at [[Wudang Mountains|Mount Wudang]], where he will be safe from Jen's family, who are furious with him. Jen runs away from her husband on the wedding night before the marriage could be consummated. She fights several warriors in an inn and is victorious.

Jen visits Shu Lien, who tells her that Lo is waiting for her at Mount Wudang. After an angry dispute, the two women engage in a duel.  Wielding the ''Green Destiny'', Jen destroys each weapon that Shu Lien wields until losing to a broken sword held at her neck.  When Shu Lien shows mercy and lowers the sword, Jen injures Shu Lien's arm.  Mu Bai arrives and pursues Jen into a bamboo forest. Following a duel where Mu Bai regains possession of the ''Green Destiny'', he decides to throw the sword over a waterfall. In pursuit, Jen dives into an adjoining river to retrieve the sword and is then rescued by Fox. Fox puts Jen into a drugged sleep and places her in a cavern; Mu Bai and Shu Lien discover her there. Fox suddenly reappears and attacks the others with poisoned darts. Mu Bai blocks the needles with his sword and avenges his master's death by mortally wounding Fox, only to realize that one of the darts hit him in the neck. Fox dies, confessing that her goal had been to kill Jen, because she was furious that Jen hid the secrets of Wudang from her.

As Jen exits to retrieve an ingredient for the antidote for the poisoned dart, Mu Bai prepares to die. With his last breaths, he finally confesses his love for Shu Lien. He dies in her arms as Jen returns, too late to save him. The ''Green Destiny'' is returned to Sir Te. Jen later goes to Mount Wudang and spends one last night with Lo. The next morning, Lo finds Jen standing on a balcony overlooking the edge of the mountain. In an echo of the legend that they spoke about in the desert, she asks him to make a wish. He complies, wishing for them to be together, back in the desert. Jen then leaps over the side of the mountain and into the clouds.

==Themes and interpretations==

===Title===
The name "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon" is a literal translation of the Chinese idiom "<U+5367><U+864E><U+85CF><U+9F99>" which describes a place that is full of talented or extraordinary people who remain hidden and undiscovered, or simply means "talented or extraordinary people hidden from view". It is from a poem of the ancient Chinese poet [[Yu Xin (poet)|Yu Xin]]'s (513-581) that reads "<U+6697><U+77F3><U+7591><U+85CF><U+864E><U+FF0C><U+76D8><U+6839><U+4F3C><U+5367><U+9F99>", which means "behind the rock in the dark probably hides a tiger, and the coiling giant root resembles a crouching dragon."<ref name="title">{{cite web|url=http://www.zdic.net/c/7/172/385491.htm|title=Chinese Dictionary <U+2013> Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon|accessdate=June 27, 2013}}</ref>

===Teacher-student relationship===
A teacher's desire to have a worthy student, the obligations between a student and a master, and tensions in these relationships are central to the characters' motives, conflicts between the characters, and the unfolding of the film's plot. Li Mu Bai is burdened with the responsibility for avenging his master's death, and turns his back on retirement to live up to this obligation. His fascination with the prospect of having Jen as a disciple also motivates his behavior, and that of Jade Fox. 

Regarding conflicts in the student-teacher relationship, the potential for exploitation created by the subordinate position of the student and the tensions that exist when a student surpasses or resists a teacher are explored. Jen hides her mastery of martial arts from her teacher, Jade Fox, which leads both to their parting of ways and to Jade Fox's attempt on Jen's life. At the same time, Jade Fox's own unorthodox relationship with a Wudang master (who she claims would not teach her, but did take sexual advantage of her) brought her to a life of crime. At times, Li Mu Bai and Jen's conversations more than hint that the desire for a teacher-student relationship could turn into a romantic relationship.<ref>Jaffe, Valerie. [http://www.brooklynrail.org/2001/02/film/fear-of-flying-crouching-tiger-hidden-dragon "Fear of Flying: Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"], ''The Brooklyn Rail'', Feb/March 2001.</ref> Jen responds to these feelings, and her desire to not submit to a teacher, by turning away from Li Mu Bai when she jumps in the lake after the ''Green Destiny''.

===Poison===
Poison is also a significant theme in the film. In the world of martial arts, poison is considered the act of one who is too cowardly and dishonorable to fight; and indeed, the only character that explicitly fits these characteristics is Jade Fox. The poison is a weapon of her bitterness,<ref>Fairlamb, Horace L. <U+201C>Romancing the Tao: How Ang Lee Globalized Ancient Chinese Wisdom,<U+201D> ''symploke'' vol. 15, No. 1-2 (2007), p.196.</ref> and quest for vengeance: she poisons the master of Wudang, attempts to poison Jen and succeeds in killing Mu Bai using a poisoned needle. 

However, the poison is not only of the physical sort: Jade Fox<U+2019>s tutelage of Jen has left Jen spiritually poisoned, which can be seen in the lying, stealing and betrayal Jen commits. Even though she is the one who initially trained Jen, Jen is never seen to use poison herself. This indicates that there is hope yet to reform her and integrate her into society. In further play on this theme by the director, Jade Fox, as she dies, refers to the poison from a young child, "the deceit of an eight-year-old girl", obviously referring to what she considers her own spiritual poisoning by her young apprentice Jen. Li Mu Bai himself warns that without guidance, Jen could become a "poison dragon".

==Production==

===Filming===
Although its [[Academy Award]] was presented to Taiwan, ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' was in fact an international [[Co-production (film)|co-production]] between companies in four regions: the Chinese company [[China Film Co-Production Corporation]]; the American companies [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia Pictures Film Production Asia]], [[Sony Pictures Classics]] and [[Good Machine]]; the Hong Kong company EDKO Film; and the Taiwanese Zoom Hunt International Productions Company, Ltd; as well as the unspecified United China Vision, and Asia Union Film & Entertainment Ltd., created solely for this film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/442944/Crouching-Tiger-Hidden-Dragon/original-print-info.html|title=CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON (2000): Original Print Information|author=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.tvguide.com/crouching-tiger-hidden-dragon/cast/134505|title=Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Cast & Details| work=[[TV Guide]]|year=2000}}</ref>

The film was made in Beijing, with location shooting in the [[Anhui]], [[Hebei]], [[Jiangsu]] and [[Xinjiang]] provinces of China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/crouching-tiger-hidden-dragon/production-details.html|title=Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) - Production Details|publisher=[[Yahoo Movies]]}}</ref> The first phase of shooting was in the [[Gobi Desert]] where it would consistently rain. Director Ang Lee noted that "I didn't take one break in eight months, not even for half a day. I was miserable<U+2014>I just didn't have the extra energy to be happy. Near the end, I could hardly breathe. I thought I was about to have a stroke."<ref name="Time">{{cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,90548-1,00.html|title=Year of the Tiger|work=[[TIME Magazine|TIME]] | last=Corliss | first= Richard|date=3 December 2000 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> The stunt work was mostly performed by the actors themselves and Ang Lee stated in an interview that computers were used "only to remove the safety wires that held the actors". "Most of the time you can see their faces," he added, "That's really them in the trees."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20001222/REVIEWS/12220304/1023|title=Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon| last= Ebert | first= Roger|work=Chicago Sun Times|date=December 20, 2000|accessdate=2011-006-29}}</ref>

Another compounding issue were the varying [[Accent (dialect)|accent]]s of the four lead actors: [[Chow Yun Fat]] is from Hong Kong and spoke Cantonese natively and [[Michelle Yeoh]] is from Malaysia and spoke English. Only [[Zhang Ziyi]] spoke with a native Mandarin accent that Ang Lee wanted.<ref name="Time"/> Chow Yun Fat said that on "the first day [of shooting] I had to do 28 takes just because of the language. That's never happened before in my life."<ref name="Time"/> 

Because the film specifically targeted [[Western world|Western]] audiences rather than the domestic audiences who were already used to Wuxia films, English subtitles were needed. Ang Lee, who was educated in the West, personally edited the subtitles to ensure they were satisfactory for Western audiences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monkeypeaches.com/hero/interview01.html|title=Interview: Zhang Yimou|publisher= MonkeyPeaches.com | accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref>

===Soundtrack===
{{Main|Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (soundtrack)}}

The score was composed by [[Tan Dun]], originally performed by [[Shanghai Symphony Orchestra]], Shanghai National Orchestra, and Shanghai Percussion Ensemble. It also features many solo passages for cello played by [[Yo-Yo Ma]]. The "last track" (''A Love Before Time'') features [[Coco Lee]]. The music for the entire film was produced in two weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/culture/80718.htm| title= Tan Dun, a Musical Journey Back to Roots| publisher= China International Information Center| year= 2003| accessdate=2011-07-24}}</ref>

''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' was very well received in the Western world, receiving critical acclaim and numerous awards. The review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 97% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 143 reviews,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/crouching_tiger_hidden_dragon/ |title=Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (1999) |accessdate=July 27, 2010 |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> while [[Metacritic]] reported the film had an average score of 93 out of 100, based on 31 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/crouching-tiger-hidden-dragon |title=Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon |accessdate=July 21, 2008 |publisher=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref>

Some Chinese-speaking viewers were bothered by the accents of the leading actors. Neither Chow (a native [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]] speaker) nor Yeoh (who was born and raised in Malaysia) speaks [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] as a [[mother tongue]]. All four main actors spoke with different accents: Chow speaks with a Cantonese accent;<ref>Hu, Brian (December 20, 2006). [http://www.asiaarts.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=59579 "An Accent on Acting: An Interview with Gong Li"]. ''UCLA Asia Institute''. Accessed December 30, 2006.</ref> Yeoh with a Malaysian accent; Chang Chen a Taiwanese accent; and Zhang Ziyi a Beijing accent. Yeoh responded to this complaint in a December 28, 2000, interview with ''[[Cinescape]]''. She argued that "My character lived outside of Beijing, and so I didn't have to do the Beijing accent". When the interviewer, Craig Reid, remarked that "My mother-in-law has this strange [[Sichuan]]-Mandarin accent that's hard for me to understand", Yeoh responded: "Yes, provinces all have their very own strong accents. When we first started the movie, Cheng Pei Pei was going to have her accent, and Chang Zhen was going to have his accent, and this person would have that accent. And in the end nobody could understand what they were saying. Forget about us, even the crew from Beijing thought this was all weird".<ref>Reid, Craig (December 28, 2000).

The film led to a boost in popularity of Chinese wuxia films in the western world, where they were previously little known, and led to films such as ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'' and ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' marketed towards western audiences. The film also provided the breakthrough role for [[Zhang Ziyi]]'s career, who noted that:

{{quote|Because of movies like ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'', and ''Hero'' and ''Memoirs of a Geisha'', a lot of people in the United States have become interested not only in me but in Chinese and Asian actors in general. Because of these movies, maybe there will be more opportunities for Asian actors".}}

The character of Lo, or "Dark Cloud" the desert bandit, influenced the development of the [[protagonist]] of the ''[[Prince of Persia]]'' series of video games.<ref>"''Prince of Persia'': Anatomy of a Prince", ''PlayStation: The Official Magazine'' 13 (December 2008): 50.</ref>
