It is named after the ancient Greek deity of the sky [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] ({{lang-grc|[[wikt:<U+03BF><U+1F50><U+03C1><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03CC><U+03C2>#Ancient Greek|<U+039F><U+1F50><U+03C1><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03CC><U+03C2>]]}}) the father of [[Cronus|Kronos]] ([[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]) and grandfather of [[Zeus]] ([[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]). Though it is visible to the naked eye like the five [[classical planet]]s, it was never recognized as a planet by ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit.<ref>{{cite web|title=MIRA's Field Trips to the Stars Internet Education Program|work=Monterey Institute for Research in Astronomy|url=http://www.mira.org/fts0/planets/101/text/txt001x.htm|accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref> Sir [[William Herschel]] announced its discovery on March 13, 1781, expanding the known boundaries of the [[solar system]] for the first time in modern history. This was also the first discovery of a planet made using a [[telescope]].

Uranus is similar in composition to [[Neptune]], and both have different compositions from those of the larger [[gas giant]]s [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]]. As such, astronomers sometimes place them in a separate category, the "[[ice giant]]s". Uranus's atmosphere, while similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in being composed primarily of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], contains a higher proportion of "[[volatiles|ices]]" such as [[water (molecule)|water]], [[ammonia]] and [[methane]], along with traces of [[hydrocarbon]]s.<ref name=Lunine1993/> It is the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49&nbsp;[[kelvin|K]] (&minus;224&nbsp;[[Celsius|<U+00B0>C]]). It has a complex, layered [[cloud]] structure, with water thought to make up the lowest clouds, and methane thought to make up the uppermost layer of clouds.<ref name=Lunine1993/> In contrast the interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.<ref name=Podolak1995/> 

Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a [[ring system]], a [[magnetosphere]], and numerous [[natural satellite|moons]]. The Uranian system has a unique configuration among the planets because its [[axis of rotation]] is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its revolution about the Sun. As such, its north and south poles lie where most other planets have their equators.<ref name=Smith1986/> Seen from Earth, Uranus's rings can sometimes appear to circle the planet like an [[Target archery|archery target]] and its moons revolve around it like the hands of a clock, though in 2007 and 2008 the rings appeared edge-on. In 1986, images from ''[[Voyager 2]]'' showed Uranus as a virtually featureless planet in visible light without the cloud bands or [[storms]] associated with the other giants.<ref name=Smith1986/> However, terrestrial observers have seen signs of [[season]]al change and increased [[weather]] activity in recent years as Uranus approached its [[equinox]]. The wind speeds on Uranus can reach 250 meters per second (900&nbsp;km/h, 560&nbsp;mph).<ref name=Sromovsky2005/>

==History==
===Discovery===
Uranus had been observed on many occasions before its discovery as a planet, but it was generally mistaken for a star. The earliest recorded sighting was in 1690 when [[John Flamsteed]] observed the planet at least six times, cataloging it as 34 [[Taurus (constellation)|Tauri]]. The French astronomer, [[Pierre Lemonnier]], observed Uranus at least twelve times between 1750 and 1769,<ref>{{cite web | title=Uranus<U+2014>About Saying, Finding, and Describing It | publisher=Astronomy Briefly |url=http://www.thespaceguy.com/Uranus.htm | last=Dunkerson |first=Duane |publisher=thespaceguy.com |accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref> including on four consecutive nights.

Sir [[William Herschel]] observed the planet on 13 March 1781 while in the garden of his house at 19 New King Street in the town of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Somerset]] (now the [[Herschel Museum of Astronomy]]),<ref>{{cite web|title=Bath Preservation Trust|url=http://www.bath-preservation-trust.org.uk/|accessdate=2007-09-29}}</ref> but initially reported it (on 26 April 1781) as a "[[comet]]".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Account of a Comet, By Mr. Herschel, F. R. S.; Communicated by Dr. Watson, Jun. of Bath, F. R. S|author=William Herschel|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|volume=71|pages=492&ndash;501|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1781RSPT...71..492H|doi=10.1098/rstl.1781.0056|year=1781}}</ref> Herschel "engaged in a series of observations on the parallax of the fixed stars",<ref>Journal of the Royal Society and Royal Astronomical Society 1, 30, quoted in Ellis D. Miner, Uranus: The Planet, Rings and Satellites, New York, John Wiley and Sons, 1998 p. 8</ref> using a telescope of his own design.

He recorded in his journal "In the quartile near [[Zeta Tauri|<U+03B6> Tauri]] <U+2026> either [a] Nebulous star or perhaps a comet".<ref>Royal Astronomical Society MSS W.2/1.2, 23; quoted in Miner p. 8</ref> On March 17, he noted, "I looked for the Comet or Nebulous Star and found that it is a Comet, for it has changed its place".<ref>RAS MSS Herschel W.2/1.2, 24, quoted in Miner p. 8</ref> When he presented his discovery to the [[Royal Society]], he continued to assert that he had found a comet while also implicitly comparing it to a planet:<ref> Journal of the Royal Society and Royal Astronomical Society 1, 30; quoted in Miner p. 8</ref>
 
{{cquote|The power I had on when I first saw the comet was 227. From experience I know that the diameters of the fixed stars are not proportionally magnified with higher powers, as planets are; therefore I now put the powers at 460 and 932, and found that the diameter of the comet increased in proportion to the power, as it ought to be, on the supposition of its not being a fixed star, while the diameters of the stars to which I compared it were not increased in the same ratio. Moreover, the comet being magnified much beyond what its light would admit of, appeared hazy and ill-defined with these great powers, while the stars preserved that lustre and distinctness which from many thousand observations I knew they would retain. The sequel has shown that my surmises were well-founded, this proving to be the Comet we have lately observed.}}

Herschel notified the [[Astronomer Royal]], [[Nevil Maskelyne]], of his discovery and received this flummoxed reply from him on April 23: "I don't know what to call it. It is as likely to be a regular planet moving in an orbit nearly circular to the sun as a Comet moving in a very eccentric ellipsis. I have not yet seen any coma or tail to it".<ref>RAS MSS Herschel W1/13.M, 14 quoted in Miner p. 8</ref>

While Herschel continued to cautiously describe his new object as a comet, other astronomers had already begun to suspect otherwise. Russian astronomer [[Anders Johan Lexell]] estimated its distance as 18 times the distance of the Sun from the Earth, and no comet had yet been observed with a [[perihelion]] of even four times the Earth<U+2013>Sun distance.<ref name=georgeforbes>{{cite web|title=History of Astronomy|author=George Forbes|year=1909|url=http://www.vinnysa1store.com/historyofastronomy2.html#8|accessdate=2007-08-07}}</ref> Berlin astronomer [[Johann Elert Bode]] described Herschel's discovery as "a moving star that can be deemed a hitherto unknown planet-like object circulating beyond the orbit of Saturn".<ref>Johann Elert Bode, Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch, p. 210, 1781, quoted in Miner p. 11</ref> Bode concluded that its near-circular orbit was more like a planet than a comet.<ref>Miner p. 11</ref>

The object was soon universally accepted as a new planet. By 1783, Herschel himself acknowledged this fact to Royal Society president [[Joseph Banks]]: "By the observation of the most eminent Astronomers in Europe it appears that the new star, which I had the honour of pointing out to them in March 1781, is a Primary Planet of our Solar System."<ref name=Dreyer>{{cite book|author=[[J. L. E.

===Naming===
Maskelyne asked Herschel to "do the astronomical world the faver [''sic''] to give a name to your planet, which is entirely your own, & which we are so much obliged to you for the discovery of."<ref>RAS MSS Herschel W.1/12.M, 20, quoted in Miner p. 12</ref> In response to Maskelyne's request, Herschel decided to name the object ''Georgium Sidus'' (George's Star), or the "Georgian Planet" in honour of his new patron, King George III.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060210222142/http://vesuvius.jsc.nasa.gov/er/seh/hersc.html | title= Voyager at Uranus | year=1986 | journal=Nasa Jpl | pages=400&ndash;268 | volume=7 | issue=85}}</ref> He explained this decision in a letter to Joseph Banks:<ref name=Dreyer />
[[Image:William Herschel01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[William Herschel]], discoverer of Uranus]]

{{cquote|''In the fabulous ages of ancient times the appellations of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were given to the Planets, as being the names of their principal heroes and divinities. In the present more philosophical era it would hardly be allowable to have recourse to the same method and call it Juno, Pallas, Apollo or Minerva, for a name to our new heavenly body. The first consideration of any particular event, or remarkable incident, seems to be its chronology: if in any future age it should be asked, when this last-found Planet was discovered? It would be a very satisfactory answer to say, 'In the reign of King George the Third''.}}

Herschel's proposed name was not popular outside of Britain, and alternatives were soon proposed.  Astronomer [[J<U+00E9>r<U+00F4>me Lalande]] proposed the planet be named ''Herschel'' in honour of its discoverer.<ref name=Francisca>{{cite web|title=The meaning of the symbol H+o for the planet Uranus|author=Francisca Herschel|year=1917|work=The Observatory|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1917Obs....40..306H|accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref> [[Johann Elert Bode|Bode]], however, opted for ''Uranus'', the Latinized version of the [[Greek mythology|Greek god]] of the sky, [[Uranus (mythology)|Ouranos]].

Uranus is the only planet whose name is derived from a figure from [[Greek mythology]] rather than [[Roman mythology]]. The adjective of Uranus is "Uranian". Its [[astronomical symbol]] is [[Image:Uranus symbol.svg|20px|Astronomical symbol for Uranus]]. It is a hybrid of the symbols for [[Mars]] and the [[Sun]] because Uranus was the Sky in Greek mythology, which was thought to be dominated by the combined powers of the Sun and Mars.<ref>{{cite web|title=Planet symbols|work=NASA Solar System exploration|url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/display.cfm?IM_ID=167|accessdate=2007-08-04}}</ref> Its [[astrological symbol]] is [[Image:Uranus's astrological symbol.svg|20px|]], suggested by Lalande in 1784. In a letter to Herschel, Lalande described it as "un globe surmont<U+00E9> par la premi<U+00E8>re lettre de votre nom" ("a globe surmounted by the first letter of your name").<ref name=Francisca /> In the [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] languages, the planet's name is literally translated as the ''sky king star'' (<U+5929><U+738B><U+661F>).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eternalsailormoon.org/help.html#myth | title=Sailormoon Terms and Information | publisher=The Sailor Senshi Page

==Orbit and rotation==
[[Image:Uranusandrings.jpg|thumb|[[Hubble Space Telescope|HST]] image of Uranus showing cloud bands, rings, and moons]]
Uranus revolves around the Sun once every 84 Earth years. Its average distance from the Sun is roughly 3 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]]&nbsp;km (about 20 [[Astronomical Units|AU]]). The intensity of sunlight on Uranus is about 1/400 that on Earth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Next Stop Uranus| url=http://www.astrosociety.org/education/publications/tnl/04/04.html|year=1986|accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref> Its orbital elements were first calculated in 1783 by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]].<ref name=georgeforbes /> With time, discrepancies began to appear between the predicted and observed orbits, and in 1841, [[John Couch Adams]] first proposed that the differences might be due to the gravitational tug of an unseen planet. In 1845, [[Urbain Le Verrier]] began his own independent research into Uranus's orbit. On September 23, 1846, [[Johann Gottfried Galle]] [[Discovery of Neptune|located a new planet]], later named [[Neptune]], at nearly the position predicted by Le Verrier.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mathematical discovery of planets|author=J J O'Connor and E F Robertson|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Neptune_and_Pluto.html|X|year=1996|accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref>

The rotational period of the interior of Uranus is 17&nbsp;hours, 14&nbsp;minutes. However, as on all giant planets, its upper atmosphere experiences very strong winds in the direction of rotation. In effect, at some latitudes, such as about two-thirds of the way from the equator to the south pole, visible features of the atmosphere move much faster, making a full rotation in as little as 14 hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=Uranus|work=NASA World Book|author=Peter J. Gierasch and Philip D. Nicholson|url=http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/uranus_worldbook.html|year=2004|accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref>

===Axial tilt===
Uranus's axis of rotation lies on its side with respect to the plane of the Solar System, with an [[axial tilt]] of 97.77 degrees. This gives it seasonal changes completely unlike those of the other major planets. Other planets can be visualized to rotate like tilted spinning [[top]]s relative to the plane of the solar system, while Uranus rotates more like a tilted rolling [[ball]]. Near the time of Uranian [[solstice]]s, one pole faces the [[Sun]] continuously while the other pole faces away. Only a narrow strip around the equator experiences a rapid day-night cycle, but with the Sun very low over the horizon as in the Earth's polar regions.

One result of this axis orientation is that, on average during the year, the polar regions of Uranus receive a greater energy input from the Sun than its equatorial regions. Nevertheless, Uranus is hotter at its equator than at its poles. The underlying mechanism which causes this is unknown. The reason for Uranus's unusual axial tilt is also not known with certainty, but the usual speculation is that during the formation of the Solar System, an Earth sized [[protoplanet]] collided with Uranus, causing the skewed orientation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jay T.Bergstralh, Ellis Miner, Mildred Matthews|title=Uranus|year=1991|pages= 485&ndash;486}}</ref> Uranus's south pole was pointed almost directly at the Sun at the time of ''[[Voyager 2]]'''s flyby in 1986.

==Internal structure==
[[Image:Uranus, Earth size comparison.jpg|thumb|Size comparison of Earth and Uranus]]

Uranus's mass is roughly 14.5&nbsp;times that of the Earth, making it the least massive of the giant planets, while its density of 1.27 g/cm<U+00B3> makes it the second least dense planet, after Saturn.<ref name=Jacobson1992>{{cite journal|last=Jacobson|first=R.A.|coauthors=Campbell, J.K.; Taylor, A.H.; Synnott, S.P.|title=The masses of Uranus and its major satellites from Voyager tracking data and Earth-based Uranian satellite data|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=103|issue=6|pages=2068&ndash;2078|year=1992|doi=10.1086/116211| url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992AJ....103.2068J}}</ref> Though having a diameter slightly larger than Neptune's (roughly four times Earth's), it is less massive.<ref name=Seidelmann2007/> These values indicate that it is made primarily of various [[volatiles|ices]], such as [[water (molecule)|water]], [[ammonia]], and [[methane]].<ref name=Podolak1995>{{cite journal|last=Podolak|first=M.|coauthors=Weizman, A.; Marley, M.|title=Comparative models of Uranus and Neptune|journal=Planet.

The standard model of Uranus's structure is that it consists of three layers: a rocky [[core (geology)|core]] in the center, an icy [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] in the middle and an outer gaseous [[hydrogen]]/[[helium]] envelope.<ref name=Podolak1995/><ref name=Faure2007/> The core is relatively small, with a mass of only 0.55&nbsp;Earth masses and a radius less than 20&nbsp;percent Uranus's; the mantle comprises the bulk of the planet, with around 13.4&nbsp;Earth masses, while the upper atmosphere is relatively insubstantial, weighing about 0.5&nbsp;Earth masses and extending for the last 20&nbsp;percent of Uranus's radius.<ref name=Podolak1995/><ref name=Faure2007/> Uranus's core [[density]] is around 9&nbsp;g/cm<U+00B3>, with a [[pressure]] in the center of 8&nbsp;million&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|bars]] (800 [[gigapascal|GPa]]) and a temperature of about 5000&nbsp;[[kelvin|K]].<ref name=Podolak2000/><ref name=Faure2007>{{cite encyclopedia|last= Faure|first=Gunter|coauthors=Mensing, Teresa|title=Uranus: What Happened Here?|encyclopedia=Introduction to Planetary Science|year=2007|publisher=Springer Netherlands|editor=Faure, Gunter; Mensing, Teresa M.|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-5544-7_18}}</ref> The ice mantle is not in fact composed of ice in the conventional sense, but of a hot and dense fluid consisting of water, ammonia and other [[volatiles]].<ref name=Podolak1995/><ref name=Faure2007/> This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called a water&ndash;ammonia ocean.<ref name=Atreya2006>{{cite journal|last=Atreya|first=S.|coauthors=Egeler, P.; Baines, K. |title=Water-ammonia ionic ocean on Uranus and Neptune?|journal=Geophysical Research Abstracts|volume=8|pages=05179|year=2006|format=pdf| url=http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU06/05179/EGU06-J-05179-1.pdf}}</ref> The bulk compositions of Uranus and Neptune are very different from those of [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]], with ice dominating over gases, hence justifying their separate classification as [[ice giant]]s.

While the model considered above is more or less standard, it is not unique; other models also satisfy observations. For instance, if substantial amounts of hydrogen and rocky material are mixed in the ice mantle, the total mass of ices in the interior will be lower, and, correspondingly, the total mass of rocks and hydrogen will be higher. Presently available data does not allow science to determine which model is correct.<ref name=Podolak2000/> The [[fluid]] interior structure of Uranus means that it has no [[solid]] [[surface]]. The gaseous atmosphere gradually transitions into the internal liquid layers.<ref name=Podolak1995/> However, for the sake of convenience, a revolving [[oblate spheroid]] set at the point at which atmospheric pressure equals 1&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|bar]] (100 kPa) is conditionally designated as a "surface". It has [[equator]]ial and [[Geographical pole|polar]] radii of {{nowrap|25 559 <U+00B1> 4}} and {{nowrap|24 973 <U+00B1> 20 km}}, respectively.<ref name=Seidelmann2007>{{cite journal|last= Seidelmann|first= P.

=== Internal heat ===
Uranus's [[internal heat]] appears markedly lower than that of the other giant planets; in astronomical terms, it has a low [[thermal flux]].<ref name=Sromovsky2005/><ref name=1986Hanel/> Why Uranus's internal temperature is so low is still not understood. [[Neptune]], which is Uranus's near twin in size and composition, radiates 2.61 times as much energy into space as it receives from the Sun.<ref name=Sromovsky2005/> Uranus, by contrast, radiates hardly any excess heat at all. The total power radiated by Uranus in the [[far infrared]] (i.e. [[heat]]) part of the spectrum is {{nowrap|1.06 <U+00B1> 0.08}} times the solar energy absorbed in its [[atmosphere]].<ref name=Lunine1993/><ref name=Pearl1990/> In fact, Uranus's heat flux is only {{nowrap|0.042 <U+00B1> 0.047 W/m<U+00B2>,}} which is lower than the internal heat flux of Earth of about 0.075&nbsp;[[flux|W/m<U+00B2>]].<ref name=Pearl1990/> The lowest temperature recorded in Uranus's tropopause is 49&nbsp;K (&minus;224&nbsp;<U+00B0>C), making Uranus the coldest planet in the Solar System.<ref name=Lunine1993/><ref name=Pearl1990/>

Hypotheses for this discrepancy include that when Uranus was "knocked over" by the supermassive impactor which caused its extreme axial tilt, the event also caused it to expel most of its primordial heat, leaving it with a depleted core temperature.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Ten Mysteries of the Solar System: Why is Uranus So Cold?|author=David Hawksett|journal=Astronomy Now|month=August | year=2005|pages=73}}</ref> Another hypothesis is that some form of barrier exists in Uranus's upper layers which prevents the core's heat from reaching the surface.<ref name=Podolak1995/> For example, [[convection]] may take place in a set of compositionally different layers, which may inhibit the upward [[Heat conduction|heat transport]].<ref name=Lunine1993/><ref name=Pearl1990/>

==Atmosphere==
{{main|Atmosphere of Uranus}}
Although there is no well-defined solid surface within Uranus's interior, the outermost part of Uranus's gaseous envelope that is accessible to remote sensing is called its [[atmosphere]].<ref name=Lunine1993/> Remote sensing capability extends down to roughly 300&nbsp;km below the 1 bar (100 kPa) level, with a corresponding pressure around 100&nbsp;bar (10&nbsp;MPa) and temperature of 320&nbsp;[[kelvin (unit)|K]].<ref name=dePater1991>{{cite journal|last=dePater|first=Imke|coauthors=Romani, Paul N.; Atreya, Sushil K.|title=Possible Microwave Absorption in by {{nowrap|H<sub>2</sub>S}} gas Uranus<U+2019> and Neptune<U+2019>s Atmospheres|journal=Icarus|volume=91|pages=220&ndash;233|year=1991|doi=10.1016/0019-1035(91)90020-T| url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~atreya/Articles/1991_Microwave_Absorption.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> The tenuous [[corona]] of the atmosphere extends remarkably over two planetary radii from the nominal surface at 1 bar pressure.<ref name=Herbert1987/> The Uranian atmosphere can be divided into three layers: the [[troposphere]], between altitudes of <U+2212>300 and 50&nbsp;km and pressures from 100 to 0.1&nbsp;bar; (10&nbsp;MPa to 10&nbsp;kPa), the [[stratosphere]], spanning altitudes between 50 and 4000&nbsp;km and pressures of between {{nowrap|0.1 and 10<sup>&ndash;10</sup>&nbsp;bar}} (10&nbsp;kPa to 10&nbsp;[[micropascal|<U+00B5>Pa]]), and the [[thermosphere]]/[[corona]] extending from 4,000&nbsp;km to as high as 50,000&nbsp;km from the surface.<ref name=Lunine1993>{{cite journal|title=The Atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune|last=Lunine|first=Jonathan.

==Planetary rings==
{{main|Rings of Uranus}}
[[Image:Uranian rings PIA01977 modest.jpg|thumb|Uranus's inner rings. The bright outer ring is the &epsilon; ring, eight other rings are present.]]
[[Image:Uranian rings scheme.png|thumb|Uranian ring system]]Uranus has a complicated [[planetary ring]] system, which was the second such system to be discovered in the Solar System after [[Rings of Saturn|Saturn's]].<ref name=Esposito2002/> The rings are composed of extremely dark particles, which vary in size from micrometers to a fraction of a meter.<ref name=Smith1986/>  Thirteen distinct rings are presently known, the brightest being the <U+03B5> ring. All rings of Uranus (except two) are extremely narrow&mdash;they are usually a few kilometres wide. The rings are probably quite young; the dynamics considerations indicate that they did not form with Uranus. The matter in the rings may once have been part of a moon (or moons) which was shattered by high-speed impacts. From numerous pieces of debris that formed as result of those impacts only few particles survived in a limited number of stable zones corresponding to present rings.<ref name=Esposito2002>{{cite journal |last=Esposito|first=L.W.|authorlink=Larry W.

[[William Herschel]] described a possible ring around Uranus in 1789. This sighting is generally considered doubtful, as the rings are quite faint, and in the two following centuries none were noted by other observers. Still, Herschel made an accurate description of the epsilon ring's size, its angle relative to the Earth, its red color, and its apparent changes as Uranus traveled around the Sun.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Uranus rings 'were seen in 1700s' |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6569849.stm|date=[[April 19]]2007| accessdate=2007-04-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Did William Herschel Discover The Rings Of Uranus In The 18th Century?|work=Physorg.com|url=http://www.physorg.com/news95949762.html| year=2007|accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> The ring system was definitively discovered on March 10, 1977 by [[James L. Elliot]], Edward W. Dunham, and [[Douglas J. Mink]] using the [[Kuiper Airborne Observatory]]. The discovery was serendipitous; they planned to use the [[occultation]] of the star SAO 158687 by Uranus to study the planet's [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]]. However, when their observations were analyzed, they found that the star had disappeared briefly from view five times both before and after it disappeared behind the planet. They concluded that there must be a ring system around the planet.<ref name=Elliot1977>{{cite web|title=The rings of Uranus|author=J. L. Elliot, E. Dunham & D.

In December 2005, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] detected a pair of previously unknown rings. The largest is located at twice the distance from the planet of the previously known rings. These new rings are so far from the planet that they are being called the "outer" ring system. Hubble also spotted two small satellites, one of which, [[Mab (moon)|Mab]], shares its orbit with the outermost newly discovered ring.

==Magnetic field==
[[Image:Uranian Magnetic field.gif|thumb|300px|The magnetic field of Uranus as seen by Voyager 2 in 1986. S and N are magnetic south and north poles.]]
Before the arrival of ''[[Voyager 2]]'', no measurements of the Uranian [[magnetosphere]] had been taken, so its nature remained a mystery. Before 1986, astronomers had expected the magnetic field of Uranus to be in line with the [[solar wind]], since it would then align with the planet's poles that lie in the [[ecliptic]].<ref name=1986Ness/> 

''Voyager'''s observations revealed that the [[magnetic field]] is peculiar, both because it does not originate from the planet's geometric center, and because it is tilted at 59<U+00B0> from the axis of rotation.<ref name=1986Ness>{{cite journal|last=Ness|first=Norman F.|coauthors=Acuna, Mario H.; Behannon, Kenneth W.; et al. |title=Magnetic Fields at Uranus|journal=Science|volume=233|pages=85&ndash;89|year=1986|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986Sci...233...85N |doi=10.1126/science.233.4759.85 |pmid=17812894}}</ref><ref name=Russell993/> In fact the magnetic dipole is shifted from the center of the planet towards the south rotational pole by as much as one third of the planetary radius.<ref name=1986Ness/> This unusual geometry results in a highly asymmetric magnetosphere, where the magnetic field strength on the surface in the southern hemisphere can be as low as 0.1&nbsp;[[Gauss (unit)|gauss]] (10&nbsp;[[microtesla|<U+00B5>T]]), whereas in the northern hemisphere it can be as high as 1.1&nbsp;gauss (110&nbsp;<U+00B5>T).<ref name=1986Ness/> The average field at the surface is 0.23&nbsp;gauss (23&nbsp;<U+00B5>T).<ref name=1986Ness/> In comparison, the magnetic field of Earth is roughly as strong at either pole, and its "magnetic equator" is roughly parallel with its geographical equator.<ref name=Russell993/> The dipole moment of Uranus is 50&nbsp;times that of Earth.<ref name=1986Ness/><ref name=Russell993>{{cite journal|last=Russell|first=C.T.|title= Planetary Magnetospheres |journal=Rep.

Despite its curious alignment, in other respects the Uranian magnetosphere is like those of other planets: it has a [[bow shock]] located at about 23 Uranian radii ahead of it, a [[magnetopause]] at 18 Uranian radii, a fully developed [[magnetosphere#Magnetic Tails|magnetotail]] and [[radiation belt]]s.<ref name=1986Ness/><ref name=Russell993/><ref name=Krimigis1986>{{cite journal|last=Krimigis|first=S.M.|coauthors=Armstrong, T.P.; Axford, W.I.; et al.|title=The Magnetosphere of Uranus: Hot Plasma and radiation Environment|journal=Science|volume=233|pages=97&ndash;102|year=1986| url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986Sci...233...97K|doi=10.1126/science.233.4759.97|pmid=17812897}}</ref> Overall, the structure of Uranus's magnetosphere is different from [[Jupiter]]'s and more similar to Saturn's.<ref name=1986Ness/><ref name=Russell993/> Uranus's [[magnetosphere#Magnetic Tails|magnetotail]] trails behind the planet into space for millions of kilometers and is twisted by the planet's sideways rotation into a long corkscrew.<ref name=1986Ness/><ref>{{cite web|title=Voyager: Uranus: Magnetosphere|url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/science/uranus_magnetosphere.html|work=NASA|year=2003|accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref>

[[Image:Uranuscolour.png|thumb|Uranus's southern hemisphere in approximate natural colour (left) and in higher wavelengths (right), showing its faint cloud bands and atmospheric "hood" as seen by Voyager 2]]

At ultraviolet and visible wavelengths, Uranus's atmosphere is remarkably bland in comparison to the other gas giants, even to Neptune, which it otherwise closely resembles.<ref name=Sromovsky2005/> When ''[[Voyager 2]]'' flew by Uranus in 1986, it observed a total of ten cloud features across the entire planet.<ref name=Smith1986/><ref name=planetary>{{cite web|title=No Longer Boring: 'Fireworks' and Other Surprises at Uranus Spotted Through Adaptive Optics|author=Emily Lakdawalla |work=The Planetary Society|url=http://www.planetary.org/news/2004/1111_No_Longer_Boring_Fireworks_and_Other.html|year=2004|accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref> One proposed explanation for this dearth of features is that Uranus's [[internal heat]] appears markedly lower than that of the other giant planets.

===Banded structure, winds and clouds===
[[Image:Uranian wind speeds.png|thumb|Zonal wind speeds on Uranus. Shaded areas show the southern collar and its future northern counterpart. The red curve is a symmetrical fit to the data.]]
In 1986 [[Voyager 2]] found that the visible southern hemisphere of Uranus can be subdivided into two regions: a bright polar cap and dark equatorial bands (see figure on the right).<ref name=Smith1986/> Their boundary is located at about <U+2212>45 degrees of [[latitude]]. A narrow band straddling the latitudinal range from <U+2212>45 to <U+2212>50 degrees is the brightest large feature on the visible surface of the planet.<ref name=Smith1986/><ref name=Hammel2005>{{cite journal|last=Hammel|first=H.B.|coauthors=de Pater, I.; Gibbard, S.; et al.|title=Uranus in 2003: Zonal winds, banded structure, and discrete features|journal=Icarus|volume=175|pages=534&ndash;545|year=2005| doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2004.11.012|url=http://www.llnl.gov/tid/lof/documents/pdf/316112.pdf|format=pdf}}</ref> It is called a southern "collar". The cap and collar are thought to be a dense region of [[methane]] clouds located within the pressure range of 1.3 to 2&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|bar]] (see above).<ref name=Rages2004/> Unfortunately [[Voyager 2]] arrived during the height of the planet's southern summer and could not observe the northern hemisphere. However, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, when the northern polar region came into view, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST) and [[Keck telescopes|Keck]] telescope observed neither a collar nor a polar cap in the northern hemisphere.<ref name=Hammel2005/> So Uranus appears to be asymmetric: bright near the south pole and uniformly dark in the region north of the southern collar.<ref name=Hammel2005/>   In addition to large-scale banded structure, Voyager 2 observed ten small bright clouds, most lying several degrees to the north from the collar.<ref name=Smith1986/> In all other respects Uranus looked like a dynamically dead planet in 1986.

However in the 1990s, the number of the observed bright cloud features grew considerably partly because new high resolution imaging techniques became available.<ref name=Sromovsky2005/> The majority of them were found in the northern hemisphere as it started to become visible.<ref name=Sromovsky2005/> An early explanation&mdash;that bright clouds are easier to identify in the dark part of the planet, whereas in the southern hemisphere the bright collar masks them&mdash;was shown to be incorrect: the actual number of features has indeed increased considerably.<ref name=Karkoschka2001/><ref name=Hammel2005b/> Nevertheless there are differences between the clouds of each hemisphere. The northern clouds are smaller, sharper and brighter.<ref name=Hammel2005b/> They appear to lie at a higher [[altitude]].<ref name=Hammel2005b/>  The lifetime of clouds spans several orders of magnitude. Some small clouds live for hours, while at least one southern cloud may have persisted since Voyager flyby.<ref name=Sromovsky2005/><ref name=planetary/> Recent observation also discovered that cloud features on Uranus have a lot in common with those on Neptune.<ref name=Sromovsky2005/> For example, the dark spots common on [[Neptune]] had never been observed on Uranus before 2006, when the first such feature was imaged.<ref name=DarkSpot/>  The speculation is that Uranus is becoming more Neptune-like during its equinoctial season.<ref name=Hammel2007/>

[[Image:Uranus Dark spot.jpg|thumb|The first dark spot observed on Uranus. Image obtained by [[Advanced Camera for Surveys|ACS]] on [[Hubble Space Telescope|HST]] in 2006.]]
The tracking of numerous cloud features allowed determination of [[Zonal and meridional|zonal]] winds blowing in the upper [[troposphere]] of Uranus.<ref name=Sromovsky2005/> At the [[equator]] winds are retrograde, which means that they blow in the reverse direction to the planetary rotation. Their speeds are from <U+2212>100 to <U+2212>50&nbsp;m/s.<ref name=Sromovsky2005/><ref name=Hammel2005/> Wind speeds increase with the distance from the equator, reaching zero values near <U+00B1>20<U+00B0> latitude, where the troposphere's temperature minimum is located.<ref name=Sromovsky2005/><ref name=1986Hanel/> Closer to the poles, the winds shift to a prograde direction, flowing with the planet's rotation. Windspeeds continue to increase reaching maxima at <U+00B1>60<U+00B0> latitude before falling to zero at the poles.<ref name=Sromovsky2005/> Windspeeds at <U+2212>40<U+00B0> latitude range from 150 to 200&nbsp;m/s. Since the collar obscures all clouds below that parallel, speeds between it and the southern pole are impossible to measure.<ref name=Sromovsky2005/> In contrast, in the northern hemisphere maximum speeds as high as 240&nbsp;m/s are observed near +50 degrees of latitude.<ref name=Sromovsky2005/><ref name=Hammel2005/><ref name=Hammel2001>{{cite journal|last=Hammel|first=H.B.|coauthors=Rages, K.; Lockwood, G.W.; et al.|title=New Measurements of the Winds of Uranus|journal=Icarus| volume=153|pages=229&ndash;235|year=2001| doi=10.1006/icar.2001.6689| url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001Icar..153..229H}}</ref>

However there are some reasons to believe that physical seasonal changes are happening in Uranus. While the planet is known to have a bright south polar region, the north pole is fairly dim, which is incompatible with the model of the seasonal change outlined above.<ref name=Hammel2007>{{cite journal|last=Hammel|first=H.B.|coauthors=Lockwood, G.W.|title=Long-term atmospheric variability on Uranus and Neptune|journal=Icarus|year=2007|volume=186|pages=291<U+2013>301|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2006.08.027| url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007Icar..186..291H}}</ref> During its previous northern solstice in 1944, Uranus displayed elevated levels of brightness, which suggests that the north pole was not always so dim.<ref name=Lockwood2006/> This information implies that the visible pole brightens some time before the solstice and darkens after the [[equinox]].<ref name=Hammel2007/> Detailed analysis of the [[visible]] and [[microwave]] data revealed that the periodical changes of brightness are not completely symmetrical around the solstices, which also indicates a change in the [[meridional]] [[albedo]] patterns.<ref name=Hammel2007/> Finally in the 1990s, as Uranus moved away from its [[solstice]], [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] and ground based telescopes revealed that the south polar cap darkened noticeably (except the southern collar, which remained bright),<ref name=Rages2004>{{cite journal|last=Rages|first=K.A.|coauthors=Hammel, H.B.; Friedson, A.J.|title=Evidence for temporal change at Uranus<U+2019> south pole|journal=Icarus|volume=172| pages=548&ndash;554|year=2004 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2004.07.009 |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004Icar..172..548R}}</ref> while the northern hemisphere demonstrates increasing activity,<ref name=planetary/> such as cloud formations and stronger winds, bolstering expectations that it should brighten soon.<ref name=Hammel2005b/> 

The mechanism of physical changes is still not clear.<ref name=Hammel2007/> Near the summer and winter [[solstice]]s, Uranus's hemispheres lie alternately either in full glare of the Sun's rays or facing deep space. The brightening of the sunlit hemisphere is thought to result from the local thickening of the [[methane]] [[cloud]]s and [[haze]] layers located in the [[troposphere]].<ref name=Rages2004/> The bright collar at <U+2212>45<U+00B0> latitude is also connected with methane clouds.<ref name=Rages2004/> Other changes in the southern polar region can be explained by changes in the lower cloud layers.<ref name=Rages2004/> The variation of the [[microwave]] [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]] from the planet is probably caused by a changes in the deep tropospheric [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]], because thick polar clouds and haze may inhibit convection.<ref name=Hofstadter2003/> Now that the spring and autumn [[equinox]]es are arriving on Uranus, the dynamics are changing and convection can occur again.<ref name=planetary /><ref name=Hofstadter2003>{{cite journal|last=Hofstadter|first=Mark D.|coauthors=and Butler, Bryan J.|title=Seasonal change in the deep atmosphere of Uranus|journal=Icarus|volume=165|pages=168&ndash;180| year=2003|doi=10.1016/S0019-1035(03)00174-X |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003Icar..165..168H}}</ref>

==Formation==

Many argue that the differences between the ice giants and the gas giants extend to their formation.<ref name=Thommes1999/><ref name=Brunini1999>{{cite journal|last=Brunini|first=Adrian|coauthors=Fernandez, Julio A.|title=Numerical simulations of the accretion of Uranus and Neptune |journal=Plan.

Much of the nebula's gas, primarily hydrogen and helium, formed the Sun, while the dust grains collected together to form the first protoplanets. As the planets grew, some of them eventually accreted enough matter for their gravity to hold onto the nebula's leftover gas.<ref name=Thommes1999/><ref name=Brunini1999/> The more gas they held onto, the larger they became; the larger they became, the more gas they held onto until a critical point was reached, and their size began to increase exponentially.

==Exploration==
{{main|Exploration of Uranus}}
In 1986, [[NASA]]'s ''[[Voyager 2]]'' visited Uranus. This visit is the only attempt to investigate the planet from a short distance and no other visits are currently planned. Launched in 1977, ''Voyager 2'' made its closest approach to Uranus on January 24, 1986, coming within 81&nbsp;500&nbsp;kilometers of the planet's cloudtops, before continuing its journey to [[Neptune]]. ''Voyager 2'' studied structure and chemical composition of the atmosphere,<ref name=1986Tyler/> discovered 10 new [[Uranus' natural satellites|moons]] and studied the planet's unique weather, caused by its [[axial tilt]] of 97.77<U+00B0>; and examined its [[Rings of Uranus|ring system]].<ref name=Smith1986/><ref>{{cite web|title=Voyager: The Interstellar Mission: Uranus|work=JPL|url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/science/uranus.html|year=2004|accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref> It also studied the [[magnetic field]], its irregular structure, its tilt and its unique corkscrew [[magnetosphere|magnetotail]] brought on by Uranus's sideways orientation.<ref name=1986Ness/> It made the first detailed investigations of its five largest moons, and studied all nine of the system's known rings, discovering two new ones.<ref name=Smith1986/><ref name=summary />
