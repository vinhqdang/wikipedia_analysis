'''Wyndham Robertson''' ([[January 26]], [[1803]] &ndash; [[February 11]], [[1888]]) was [[Governor of Virginia|Governor]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Virginia]] from 1836 to 1837. He also served twice in the Virginia House of Delegates, the second time during the [[American Civil War]]. 

Robertson was a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]], and was a advocate for Union during the secession crisis that precipitated the Civil War. However, after Lincoln's call for troops, he advocated secession. After the war, he was a member of the [[Committee of Nine]] that helped usher Virginia back into the Union.

Robertson, a descendant of [[Pocahontas]], published a book near the end of his life in her defence.

==Biography==

===Early life and family===
Robertson was born near Manchester, in [[Chesterfield County, Virginia]], the son of William Robertson and Elizabeth Bolling, a descendant of Pocahontas and [[John Rolfe]].<ref>Robertson, ''Pocahontas and Her Descendants'', 40-41</ref> His father was a member of the Virginia Council of State.<ref name="smith">Smith, 344-345</ref> Robertson attended private schools in Richmond and was graduated from [[William and Mary College]] in 1821.<ref name="smith" /><ref name="summers">Summers, History of Southwest Virginia, 766</ref> He then married Mary Trigg Smith, daughter of Captain Francis Smith.<ref name="summers" /> Robertson's brother was [[Thomas B. Robertson]], a [[Governor of Louisiana]], and [[John Robertson (U.S. congressman)|John Robertson]], a U.S. Congressman. 

Robertson studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1824.<ref name="smith" /><ref name="summers" /> In 1827, he made a short trip to Paris and London, and in 1830 he was made Counciller of State.<ref name="Robertson81">Robertson, ''Pocahontas and her Descendants'', 81</ref>

===Career===
Robertson was re-elected to the [[Council of State]] in 1833, and on March 31, 1836, he became the senior member of this body, and therefore Lieutenant-Governor of Virginia.<ref name="summers" />  When Governor [[Littleton Waller Tazewell]] resigned that same day, Robertson became Governor.<ref name="summers" /><ref name="Robertson82">Robertson, ''Pocahontas and her Descendants'', 82</ref> Since the Virginia Legislature, which elected the Governor, was Democratic, and he, being a Whig, was not, Robertson was not elected when his term was up in 1837, and he was replaced by [[David Campbell (Virginia)|David Campbell]].<ref name="summers" />

Robertson was then elected to the Virginia House of Delegates for the 1838 session.<ref>Leonard, ''The General Assembly of Virginia'', 386.</ref> He was then re-elected for three successive sessions, ending his service in 1841.<ref>Leonard, ''The General Assembly of Virginia'', 390, 394, 398.</ref>

He moved to his wife's home south of [[Abingdon, Virginia|Abingdon]], in southwest Virginia in 1841.<ref name="summers" /><ref>Year of moving is in Robertson, ''Pocahontas and her Descendants'', 82</ref> He was made a Justice of Washington County on [[July 25]], [[1842]],<ref>Summers, ''History of Southwest Virginia'', 828</ref> and was appointed a trustee of Abingdon Academy in 1843.<ref>Summers, ''History of Southwest Virginia'', 883</ref> In 1850, he leased the King Saltworks for five years.<ref>Summers, ''History of Southwest Virginia'', 586</ref> In 1858, he returned to Richmond.<ref name="summers" /> In 1859, he was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates for the 1859-1861 session.<ref>Leonard, ''The General Assembly of Virginia'', 471.</ref> When Virginia was struggling with the idea of seceding from the United States, Robertson was a staunch Unionist and tried to prevent its secession.<ref name="summers" /><ref name="smith" /> He later wrote of himself as a "friend to peace and the Union" and that he had actively opposed South Carolina's call for a Southern Convention in 1859.<ref name="Robertson82" /> In fact, he was present at the [[Henry Clay]] banquet in April of 1860, at which former President [[John Tyler]] was present, and Robertson was called on to give "The Union" toast, which he did, followed by a short speech. He then proposed the following toast:

<blockquote>"The Constitutional Union of the States" - The Union of the States is the harmony of the spheres. While obedient to the laws of their creation, they sing ever as they go 'glad tidings of great joy' to all the world. Rebelling against them, light and joy are swallowed up in darkness, and order falls back into primordial chaos.<ref>Tyler, ''The Letters and Times of the Tylers'', 464</ref></blockquote>

After [[South Carolina]] and several other states started seceding in the winter of 1860-61, he still advocated that Virginia not follow suit.<ref name="Robertson82" /><ref name="smith" /> On January 7, 1861, he presented a resolution known as the Anti-Coercion Resolution, which rejected secession, but stated that if the Federal government used coercion against the seceded states, Virginia would fight, which was duly adopted.<ref>Robertson, ''Pocahontas and her Descendants'', 82-83</ref><ref name="smith" /> However, when President [[Abraham Lincoln]] made his call for troops on April 15, 1861, he was "from that time forth zealously active in all measures for the defence of his State."<ref name="summers" /> The call for troops was precisely the scenario detailed in their Anti-Coercion Resolution and Virginia seceded.

| style="text-align: left;" | "And now, after twenty years' experience of yet unripened results, I have no regrets, nor repent a single act of my State, or myself, in these unhappy affairs - welcoming the end of slavery, but still believing it would have been reached without the horrors of war."

Robertson was re-elected to the House of Delegates for the next two sessions, ending in 1865.<ref>Leonard, ''The General Assembly of Virginia'', 480, 485.</ref> In 1863, he opposed and helped to defeat a bill to fix the prices of food, which he believed was "fraught with the direst mischief".<ref name="Robertson83" /> When a committee of citizens presented a resolution asking their representatives to support a similar bill or resign, Robertson refused. When he found that his colleagues had already acquiesced, he resigned so as not to misrepresent his constituents. The House, however, requested that his resignation be withdrawn until the wishes of his constituents could be determined. A formal poll was held and it was determined that a majority did not support the bill and Robertson retained his seat.<ref name="Robertson83" />

After the war, he moved back to Abingdon. During Reconstruction, Robertson was a member of the Committee of Nine, led by [[Alexander H. H. Stuart]], that sought Virginia's readmission to the Union.<ref>Brenaman, 78</ref> At issue was the new state constitution, which included disenfranchisement of many white males. The committee successfully negotiated with the Federal government to have that clause voted on separately, so that Virginians would accept and ratify the new constitution and so rejoin the Union.

He died on [[February 11]], [[1888]], and was buried at Cobbs, Chesterfield County.<ref name="summers" />

==Legacy and writings==

Robertson was an early donor to [[Emory and Henry College]], the interest of which furnished the Robertson prize medal for "encouraging oratory".<ref>Summers, ''History of Southwest Virginia'', 578</ref>

After the American Civil War, Northern writers began questioning the validity of the rescue story of Captain [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith]] and [[Pocahontas]], attacking the accounts of the historical role played by both, as well as that of her husband [[John Rolfe]].<ref name="poca1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ces.clemson.edu/~stb/doc/pocahontas.html|title=Did Pocahontas Save Captain John Smith?|last=Birchfield|first=Stan|accessdate=2006-09-09}}</ref> The movement was led by Henry Adams, a descendant of [[John Adams]] whose rival was [[John Randolph of Roanoke]], was a descendant of Pocahontas.<ref name="poca1" /> Several Virginians replied, one of whom was Robertson. "Northern attacks disturbed him so much that he prepared a detailed study" and wrote ''Pocahontas alias Matoaka and Her Descendants through Her Marriage with John Rolfe''.<ref name="poca2">{{cite web|last=Fishwick|first=Marshall|title=Was John Smith a Liar?|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1958/6/1958_6_28.shtml|publisher=AmericanHeritage.com|accessdate=2006-09-09}}</ref> He traced her descendants, who included the Bollings, Branches, Lewises, Randolphs, and Pages, as well as him. His argument was that since her descendants were notable, so was she. "History, poetry, and art," wrote Robertson, "have vied with one another in investing her name from that day to the present with a halo of surpassing brightness."<ref name="poca2" />
