The '''February 2007 North America Winter Storm''' (otherwise referred to as the '''Valentine's Day Blizzard''' or '''Valentine's Day Storm''') was a massive [[winter storm]] that affected most of the eastern half of [[North America]], starting on [[February 12]] [[2007]] and peaking on [[Valentine's Day]], [[February 14]]. The storm produced heavy snowfalls across the [[midwestern United States]] from [[Nebraska]] to [[Ohio]] and produced similar conditions across parts of the [[northeastern United States]],  and into Canada in [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]] and [[New Brunswick]]. Significant [[sleet]] and [[freezing rain]] fell across the southern [[Ohio Valley]] and affected portions of the east coast of the United States, including the cities of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Baltimore]], [[Washington D.C.]], [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]]. 

The southern portion of the storm produced severe thunderstorms with numerous tornadoes reported. One tornado hit a subdivision of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] that was still recovering from the effects of [[Hurricane Katrina]], which hit the region in August 2005. In total, this storm system was responsible for 37 deaths across 13 U.S. states and Canadian provinces of New Brunswick, Ontario and Quebec. The NOAA classified the storm as a Category 3 "Major" storm.<ref name = storm_category> {{cite web | author = NOAA | title = VALENTINE<U+2019>S DAY WINTER STORM CLASSIFIED AS A CATEGORY 3 "MAJOR" STORM | url = http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2007/s2803.htm | accessdate = [[2007-02-27]] }} </ref>  The National Weather Service has determined that this storm was one of the three largest snowstorms to hit the inland areas of the northeastern United States since 1940.<ref name = storm_recordbooks> {{cite web | author = [[Times Union]] | title = Valentine's Day storm stacks up against history | url = http://timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=566945&category=REGIONOTHER&BCCode=LOCAL&newsdate=2/27/2007|accessdate=2007-02-27}} </ref>

==Prior to the storm==
In sharp contrast to the mostly mild weather in the first few weeks of winter, the eastern half of the continent was under the influence of cold temperatures. Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak [[Alberta Clipper]]s crossed the eastern half of the continent and brought occasional light snowfalls, a large dip in the Northern branch of the [[jet stream]] favored a more active pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, led to the development of the storm.

Previously, portions of the [[Great Lakes]] were hit by a significant [[lake effect snow]] event which dumped incredible amounts of snow over portions of central New York. Several areas received over 115 inches (over 2.5&nbsp;m) of snow in a ten-day period just before the large winter storm as northwesterly winds and unfrozen lake surfaces due to the early winter warm weather favored the heavy snowfall. Several areas across [[Michigan]] and Ontario also received significant amounts of snow with locally 1 meter (3.3 ft) of snow east of [[Georgian Bay]] in Ontario.<ref name = cnn_newyork_squalls> {{cite web | url = http://www.cnn.com/2007/WEATHER/02/10/cold.weather.ap/index.html|title =  Snow about to give hard-hit towns a break | author = CNN.com | date = February 11, 2007}}</ref>

==Storm track==
[[Image:SnowPittsburgh.JPG|thumb|Snow coverage in [[Shaler Township, Pennsylvania]], a suburb of Pittsburgh.]]
From [[February 10]] to [[February 11|11]], a low pressure system developed near the [[Rockies]] and moved towards the [[Great Plains]] of the United States. It later tracked across the [[Ohio River|Ohio Valley]] and merged with a new coastal low. It then moved over eastern Quebec on Valentine's Day before exiting northeastern Quebec and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] on [[February 16]]. It dumped over six inches (15&nbsp;cm) of snow across numerous areas from [[Iowa]] to [[New Brunswick]], including major cities such as [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], [[Detroit]], [[Champaign-Urbana]], [[Chicago]], [[Cleveland]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Cincinnati]], [[London, Ontario|London]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], the [[Niagara Region, Ontario|Niagara Region]], [[Toronto]], [[Sherbrooke, Quebec|Sherbrooke]], [[Saguenay, Quebec|Saguenay]], [[Trois-Rivieres, Quebec|Trois-Rivieres]], [[Ottawa]], [[Montreal]], [[Quebec City]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] and [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. This also includes areas such as Northern [[Oswego County, New York]], which received historic [[lake effect snow]]fall amounts in the week prior to the storm.

In addition to the general snowfall, snow squalls coming from [[Lake Ontario]] gave local amounts of over 2 feet (600&nbsp;mm) of snow near the Hamilton and Niagara regions, where {{convert|1|ft}} of snow had already fallen on February 13.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2007/02/13/storm-ontario.html Snowstorm rumbling through Ontario, moving east], [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], February 13, 2007</ref>

Heavy ice amounts fell for locations along [[Interstate 95]] from [[Maine]] to [[Virginia]] and west towards southern [[Ohio]] and [[Indiana]]. Ice was expected for parts of the Canadian Maritimes.

=== Precipitation received ===
The storm left a mark on states like Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, which received heavy snow for over 24 hours, accumulating upwards of 18 inches (457.2&nbsp;mm) in some areas. Many parts of Northern and Northeastern Indiana received between 12 and 20 inches {{nowrap|(300<U+2013>510 mm)}}, and blizzard conditions for an extendend period of time. The heavy snow and blizzard conditions caused roads to close, and schools and businesses to close for three days. In Chicago, [[O'Hare International Airport]] received 10.2 inches (259&nbsp;mm) of snow, while [[Chicago Midway International Airport|Midway Airport]] received {{convert|12.0|in|mm}}. The Midway total was the largest amount of snow received in the month of February for one midnight-to-midnight day since records began to be kept in 1928.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/crnews/display_story.php?wfo=lot&storyid=5951&source=0 |title=Total Snowfall from the Feb 13-14 2007 Snowstorm |author=NWS Chicago |date=2007-02-14 |accessdate=2007-02-14}}</ref>

Areas of the Appalachian Mountains in northern New England and Quebec received accumulations of over {{convert|16|in}} with local amount exceeding {{convert|36|in|mm}} in parts of Vermont and {{convert|42|in|mm}} in the [[Adirondacks]] in New York state. Also in New York state, in the hills and valleys South of [[Syracuse, NY]], snowfall depths ranged from 24 to 45 inches {{nowrap|(610<U+2013>1,100 mm)}}. Snowfall rates of 5 to 6 inches {{nowrap|(130<U+2013>150 mm)}} per hour occurred in areas of western [[Schoharie County]], NY with total storm accumulations in this county approaching three feet. The City of Hamilton and the Niagara region, at their highest elevations, received just over {{convert|27.6|in}} due to snowsqualls off of Lake Ontario. [[Burlington, Vermont]] recorded record 24-hour snowfall, with {{convert|25.3|in}}.<ref name = burlington> {{cite web | url = http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/btv/html/valentine2007/summary.shtml | title = Storm Summary: 14 February 2007  | author = NWS Burlington | accessdate = [[2007-03-11]]}} </ref> Boston and Hartford, however, saw very little precipitation from the storm.

A notable feature of the system was its array of precipitation type. While the interior sections of the Northeast received mostly snow from the system, the Mid-Atlantic received snow, sleet, freezing rain and non-freezing rain. Due to the three-dimensional nature of the atmosphere, warm air was poised to overtake the cold air closer to the ground, causing precipitation to melt, then refreeze as either sleet or freezing rain.  As temperatures hovered around freezing on the southern edge of the storm track, light snow accompanied freezing rain and sleet. The freezing rain coated all surfaces with thick layers of ice, including power lines and tree limbs which break under the additional weight. Some locations in the Mid-Atlantic received several inches of sleet. Four inches (100&nbsp;mm)  of sleet caused travel difficulties and hampered cleanup efforts in [[New York City]]. New York City's sanitation department admitted to not plowing city streets, expecting the frozen precipitation to change from ice to rain. However, this never happened. Instead, temperatures dropped very quickly and caused the slush on sidewalks and roads to freeze into thick, rock hard sheets of ice.
Streets were almost impassable during the evening rush hour resulting in complete chaos. 

Ice accumulations in Virginia and Maryland reached locally three-quarters of an inch (20&nbsp;mm)<ref name = nwssterling> {{cite web |url = http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/lwx/events/14feb2007/ | title= Preliminary February 13-14, 2007 Snowfall/Ice | author = NWS Sterling, Virginia| accessdate = 2007-02-15 }} </ref> while it reached {{convert|1|in}} in central Ohio near [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] and [[Xenia, Ohio|Xenia]], with up to {{convert|0.7|in}} near [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]].<ref name = nwswilmington> {{cite web | url = http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/iln/feb13_14_2007_winterstorm/winterstormfeb1314.htm | title = February 13-14 Winter Storm | author = NWS Wilmington, Ohio | accessdate = 2007-02-15 }} </ref>

The effect on much of [[Michigan]] by the storm was light, although the extreme southern part of the state was hard hit with heavy snowfall, especially the Detroit Metro area. Wind whipped snow accumulations ranged from 7 to 10 inches {{nowrap|(180<U+2013>250 mm)}} fell throughout the area, especially the southeastern suburbs, including {{convert|8.5|in}} at both [[Detroit Metropolitan Airport]] and [[Wyandotte, Michigan|Wyandotte]], and {{convert|8.4|in}} in [[Dundee, Michigan|Dundee]]. Drifts were as high as two to three feet {{nowrap|(600<U+2013>900 mm)}}, and the snow was very powdery as it fell with temperatures around {{convert|10|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C}}.

Due to the near-record amounts of snow in the [[Appalachian]] mountain chain, National Weather Service officials had issued statement for a higher risk of [[avalanche]]s across northern New England.<ref name = avalanche> {{cite web | url = http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/btv/html/avalanche.shtml | title = Special Weather Statement | author = NWS Burlington, VT | accessdate = [[2007-02-19]] }} </ref>

===Damage and travel disruptions===
[[Image:Cars skidding edit.jpg|thumb|right|Cars unable to ascend a slope in Northern Virginia due to icy conditions<!-- related to roads, keep it in this section, please-->]]
Blizzard conditions were reported across most of the Midwest from [[Illinois]] to [[Ohio]]. Numerous flights were canceled due to the snow and ice across various airports including in [[Pearson International Airport|Toronto]], [[Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport|Ottawa]], [[Qu<U+00E9>bec/Jean Lesage International Airport|Quebec City]], [[Montr<U+00E9>al-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport|Montreal]], [[Kansas City International Airport|Kansas City]], [[Indianapolis International Airport|Indianapolis]], [[Lambert International Airport|St. Louis]], [[Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport|Cleveland]], [[Boston Logan International Airport|Boston]] and [[Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport|Cincinnati]]. 900 were canceled at [[Chicago]]'s [[O'Hare International Airport]].

[[Lackawanna County]] and [[Luzerne County]] in northeastern [[Pennsylvania]] received so much snow that every highway was closed.

At New York's [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]], several empty [[JetBlue]] airplanes were actually frozen to the tarmac at the gates and incoming flights could not access the gates as a result, while outgoing flights already taxiing were ordered held on the runway due to weather conditions.  Many passengers in planes, either landing or taking off, were held in the planes, eating peanuts and other snacks for as much as 10 hours before the decision was made to cancel the outgoing flights or a gate had opened for the inbound ones.<ref>[http://www.presstelegram.com/ci_5233281 Associated Press, ''Airline apologizes to passengers stranded on planes for hours in NYC'', , February 15, 2007]</ref><ref>[http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=traffic&id=5032401 Airport passengers weathering the storm] [[WABC-TV|WABC]], February 14, 2007 </ref>
