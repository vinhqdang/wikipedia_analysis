'''Cameroon''', officially the '''Republic of Cameroon''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|R<U+00E9>publique du Cameroun}}), is a country in the west [[Central Africa]] region. It is bordered by [[Nigeria]] to the west; [[Chad]] to the northeast; the [[Central African Republic]] to the east; and [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Gabon]], and the [[Republic of the Congo]] to the south. Cameroon's coastline lies on the [[Bight of Bonny]], part of the [[Gulf of Guinea]] and the Atlantic Ocean. The country is often referred to as "Africa in miniature" for its geological and cultural diversity. Natural features include beaches, deserts, mountains, rainforests, and savannas. The highest point is [[Mount Cameroon]] in the southwest, and the largest cities are [[Douala]], [[Yaound<U+00E9>]] and [[Garoua]]. Cameroon is home to over 200 different linguistic groups. The country is well known for its native styles of music, particularly [[makossa]] and [[bikutsi]], and for its successful [[Cameroon national football team|national football team]]. French and English are the official languages.

Early inhabitants of the territory included the [[Sao civilisation]] around [[Lake Chad]] and the [[Baka (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]] hunter-gatherers in the southeastern rainforest. [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese explorers]] reached the coast in the 15th century and named the area ''Rio dos Camar<U+00F5>es'' (''Shrimp River''), which became ''Cameroon'' in English. [[Fula people|Fulani]]<ref>In {{lang-ff|Ful<U+0253>e}}; in {{lang-fr|link=no|Peul ''or'' Peuhl}}.</ref> soldiers founded the [[Adamawa Emirate]] in the north in the 19th century, and various ethnic groups of the west and northwest established powerful chiefdoms and [[fon (Cameroon)|fondoms]]. Cameroon became a [[German Empire|German colony]] in 1884 known as 'Kamerun".

After World War I, the territory was divided between [[French Third Republic|France]] and [[British Empire|Britain]] as [[League of Nations mandate]]s. The [[Union of the Peoples of Cameroon|Union des Populations du Cameroun]] (UPC) political party advocated independence, but was outlawed by France in the 1950s. It waged war on French and UPC militant forces until 1971. In 1960, the French-administered part of Cameroon became independent as the Republic of Cameroun under President [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]]. The [[Southern Cameroons|southern part]] of [[British Cameroons]] merged with it in 1961 to form the [[Federal republic|Federal Republic]] of Cameroon. The country was renamed the [[Unitary state|United Republic]] of Cameroon in 1972 and the Republic of Cameroon in 1984.

Compared with other African countries, Cameroon enjoys relatively high political and social stability. This has permitted the development of agriculture, roads, railways, and large petroleum and timber industries. Nevertheless, large numbers of Cameroonians live in poverty as subsistence farmers. Power lies firmly in the hands of the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] president since 1982, [[Paul Biya]], and his [[Cameroon People's Democratic Movement]] party. The English-speaking territories of Cameroon have grown increasingly alienated from the government, and politicians from those regions have called for greater decentralization and even secession (for example: the [[Southern Cameroons National Council]]) of the former British-governed territories.

==History==
{{Main|History of Cameroon}}
[[File:Shumom-text.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bamum script]]]]
The territory of present day Cameroon was first settled during the [[Neolithic]]. The longest continuous inhabitants are groups such as the [[Baka (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]] (Pygmies).<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 2.</ref> From here, [[Bantu expansion|Bantu migrations]] into eastern, southern, and central Africa are believed to have originated about 2,000 years ago.<ref name="history"/> The [[Sao civilisation|Sao]] culture arose around [[Lake Chad]] c. AD 500 and gave way to the [[Kanem Empire|Kanem]] and its successor state, the [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]] empire. Kingdoms, [[fon (Cameroon)|fondoms]], and chiefdoms arose in the west.<ref name=Njung/>

[[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese sailors]] reached the coast in 1472. They noted an abundance of the ghost shrimp ''[[Lepidophthalmus turneranus]]'' in the [[Wouri River]] and named it {{lang|pt|''Rio dos Camar<U+00F5>es''}} (''Shrimp River''), which became ''Cameroon'' in English.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1080/00358539708454389}}</ref> Over the following few centuries, European interests regularised trade with the coastal peoples, and Christian [[missionary|missionaries]] pushed inland. In the early 19th century, [[Modibo Adama]] led [[Fula people|Fulani]] soldiers on a [[jihad]] in the north against non-Muslim and partially Muslim peoples and established the [[Adamawa Emirate]]. Settled peoples who fled the Fulani caused a major redistribution of population.<ref name=Fanso/> The northern part of Cameroon was an important part of the Muslim [[slave trade]] network.<ref name="history"/>

The Bamum people have an indigenous writing system, known as [[Bamum script]] or Shu Mom. The script was developed by Sultan [[Ibrahim Njoya]] in 1896,<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 59</ref><ref name="NMAA">{{cite web|url=http://africa.si.edu/exhibits/inscribing/bamum.html|title=Bamum|publisher=National Museum of African Art, Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=29 January 2012}}</ref> and is taught in Cameroon by the [[Bamum Scripts and Archives Project]].<ref name="NMAA"/> The [[German Empire]] claimed the territory as the colony of [[Kamerun]] in 1884 and began a steady push inland. They initiated projects to improve the colony's infrastructure, relying on a harsh system of [[unfree labour|forced labour]].<ref name="DeLancey 125">[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 125.</ref> With the defeat of Germany in World War I, Kamerun became a [[League of Nations mandate]] territory and was split into [[French Third Republic|French]] {{lang|fr|[[Cameroun]]}} and [[British Empire|British]] [[Cameroons]] in 1919. France integrated the economy of Cameroun with that of France<ref name="DeLancey 5">[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 5.</ref> and improved the infrastructure with capital investments, skilled workers, and continued forced labour.<ref name="DeLancey 125"/>

The British administered their territory from neighbouring [[Nigeria]]. Natives complained that this made them a neglected "colony of a colony". Nigerian migrant workers flocked to Southern Cameroons, ending forced labour but angering indigenous peoples.<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 4.</ref> The League of Nations mandates were converted into [[United Nations Trusteeship Council|United Nations Trusteeships]] in 1946, and the question of independence became a pressing issue in French Cameroun.<ref name="DeLancey 5"/> France outlawed the most radical political party, the [[Union of the Peoples of Cameroon|Union des Populations du Cameroun]] (UPC), on 13 July 1955.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1017/S0021853710000253}}</ref> This prompted a long guerrilla war and the assassination of the party's leader, [[Ruben Um Nyob<U+00E9>]]. In British Cameroons, the question was whether to reunify with French Cameroun or join Nigeria.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1080/0258900032000142455}}</ref>

[[File:DF-SC-83-08609.jpg|thumb|Former president [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]] arrives in Washington D.C. in July 1982.]]
On 1 January 1960 at 2:30&nbsp;am, French Cameroun gained independence from France under President [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]]. On 1 October 1961, the formerly British [[Southern Cameroons]] united with French Cameroun to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon. Ahidjo used the ongoing war with the UPC to concentrate power in the presidency, continuing with this even after the suppression of the UPC in 1971.<ref name="DeLancey 6">[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 6.</ref>

His political party, the [[Cameroon National Union]] (CNU), became the sole legal political party on 1 September 1966 and in 1972, the [[federation|federal system of government]] was abolished in favour of a United Republic of Cameroon, headed from [[Yaound<U+00E9>]].<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 19.</ref> Ahidjo pursued an economic policy of [[planned liberalism]], prioritising [[cash crops]] and petroleum exploitation. The government used oil money to create a national cash reserve, pay farmers, and finance major development projects; however, many initiatives failed when Ahidjo appointed unqualified allies to direct them.<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 7.</ref>

Ahidjo stepped down on 4 November 1982 and left power to his constitutional successor, [[Paul Biya]]. However, Ahidjo remained in control of the CNU and tried to run the country from behind the scenes until Biya and his allies pressured him into resigning. Biya began his administration by moving toward a more democratic government, but a failed [[Cameroonian Palace Guard Revolt|coup d'<U+00E9>tat]] nudged him toward the leadership style of his predecessor.<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 8.</ref>

An [[economic crisis of Cameroon|economic crisis]] took effect in the mid-1980s to late 1990s as a result of international economic conditions, drought, falling petroleum prices, and years of corruption, mismanagement, and [[cronyism]]. Cameroon turned to foreign aid, cut government spending, and [[privatization|privatised]] industries. With the reintroduction of multi-party politics in December 1990, the former British Cameroons pressure groups called for greater autonomy, and the [[Southern Cameroons National Council]] advocated complete secession as the Republic of [[Ambazonia]].<ref name="DeLancey 9">[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 9.</ref> In February 2008, Cameroon experienced its worst violence in 15 years when a transport union strike in Douala escalated into [[2008 Cameroonian anti-government protests|violent protests]] in 31 municipal areas.<ref name=Nkemngu/><ref name=Matthews/>

==Politics and government==

{{Main|Politics of Cameroon}}

The [[Heads of state of Cameroon|President of Cameroon]] has broad, unilateral powers to create policy, administer government agencies, command the [[military of Cameroon|armed forces]], negotiate and ratify treaties, and declare a state of emergency.<ref name="Neba 250">[[#Neba|Neba]] 250.</ref> The president appoints government officials at all levels, from the [[Prime Minister of Cameroon|prime minister]] (considered the official head of government), to the provincial governors and divisional officers.<ref name=msu>{{cite web|url=https://globaledge.msu.edu/countries/cameroon/government|accessdate=12 April 2013|title=Cameroon: Government|publisher=Michigan State University: Broad College of Business}}</ref> The president is selected by popular vote every seven years.<ref name="CIA"/>

Corruption is rife at all levels of government. In 1997, Cameroon established anti-corruption bureaus in 29 ministries, but only 25% became operational,<ref name="IRIN"/> and in 2012, [[Transparency International]] placed Cameroon at number 144 on a list of 176 countries ranked from least to most corrupt.<ref name=Corruption/> On 18 January 2006, Biya initiated an anti-corruption drive under the direction of the [[National Anti-Corruption Observatory]].<ref name="IRIN"/>

Cameroon's legal system is largely based on [[law of France|French civil law]] with common law influences.<ref name="CIA"/> Although nominally independent, the judiciary falls under the authority of the executive's [[Ministry of Justice of Cameroon|Ministry of Justice]].<ref name="State Dept"/> The president appoints judges at all levels.<ref name=msu/> The judiciary is officially divided into tribunals, the [[Court of Appeal of Cameroon|court of appeal]], and the [[Supreme Court of Cameroon|supreme court]].

The [[National Assembly of Cameroon|National Assembly]] makes legislation. The body consists of 180 members who are elected for five-year terms and meet three times per year.<ref name=msu/> Laws are passed on a majority vote. Rarely has the assembly changed or blocked legislation proposed by the president.

President Biya's [[Cameroon People's Democratic Movement]] (CPDM) was the only legal political party until December 1990. Numerous regional political groups have since formed. The primary opposition is the [[Social Democratic Front (Cameroon)|Social Democratic Front]] (SDF), based largely in the Anglophone region of the country and headed by [[John Fru Ndi]].<ref name = "lergai">[[#West|West]] 11.</ref> Biya and his party have maintained control of the presidency and the National Assembly in national elections, which rivals contend were unfair.<ref name="DeLancey 9"/> Human rights organisations allege that the government suppresses the freedoms of opposition groups by preventing demonstrations, disrupting meetings, and arresting opposition leaders and journalists.<ref name="Amnesty"/><ref name="Freedom House"/> [[Freedom House]] ranks Cameroon as "not free" in terms of political rights and civil liberties.<ref>Cameroon is rated at six in both categories on a scale of one to seven, with one being "most free" and seven being "least free".

==Education and health==
{{main|Education in Cameroon|Health in Cameroon}}

In 2001, the [[literacy]] rate of Cameroon was estimated to be 67.9% (77% for males and 59.8% for females).<ref name="CIA"/> Most children have access to state-run schools that are cheaper than private and religious facilities.<ref name="Mbaku 15">[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 15.</ref> The educational system is a mixture of British and French precedents<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 105<U+2013>6.</ref> with most instruction in English or French.<ref>[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 16.</ref> Cameroon has one of the highest school attendance rates in Africa.<ref name="Mbaku 15" /> Girls attend school less regularly than boys do because of cultural attitudes, domestic duties, early marriage and pregnancy, and sexual harassment.

The quality of health care is generally low.<ref name = "yqheor">[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 21.</ref> Due to financial cuts in the health care system there are few professionals. Doctors and nurses, which were trained in Cameroon, emigrate because in Cameroon the payment is bad for too much work. Nurses are unemployed even though their help is needed.

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Regions of Cameroon|Departments of Cameroon}}
[[File:Provinces of Cameroon EN.svg|thumb|upright|Cameroon is divided into 10 regions.]]
The [[Constitution of Cameroon|constitution]] divides Cameroon into 10 semi-autonomous regions, each under the administration of an elected [[Regional Council (Cameroon)|Regional Council]]. A presidential decree of 12 November 2008 officially instigated the change from provinces to regions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prc.cm/index_fr.php?link=les_actes/lecture_act&id=79&lang=fr&quoi=D%E9cret|title=D<U+00E9>cret N<U+00B0> 2008/376 du 12 novembre 2008|publisher=President of the Republic|accessdate=9 June 2009}}</ref> Each region is headed by a presidentially appointed governor. These leaders are charged with implementing the will of the president, reporting on the general mood and conditions of the regions, administering the civil service, keeping the peace, and overseeing the heads of the smaller administrative units. Governors have broad powers: they may order propaganda in their area and call in the army, [[gendarmerie|gendarmes]], and police.<ref name="Neba 250"/> All local government officials are employees of the central government's Ministry of Territorial Administration, from which local governments also get most of their budgets.<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/26431.htm|title=Cameroon|publisher=US Department of State|date=25 August 2011|accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref>

The regions are subdivided into 58 divisions (French {{lang|fr|''d<U+00E9>partements''}}). These are headed by presidentially appointed divisional officers ({{lang|fr|''[[prefect|pr<U+00E9>fets]]''}}). The divisions are further split into sub-divisions ({{lang|fr|''arrondissements''}}), headed by assistant divisional officers ({{lang|fr|''sous-prefets''}}). The districts, administered by district heads ({{lang|fr|''chefs de district''}}), are the smallest administrative units.<ref name=unhchr>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/0/33bb745d595710e3c125693d0035f74b?Opendocument|accessdate=12 April 2013|title=Core document forming part of the reports of States Parties: Cameroon|publisher=UNHCHR}}</ref>

The three northernmost regions are the [[Far North Region (Cameroon)|Far North]] ({{lang|fr|''Extr<U+00EA>me Nord''}}), [[North Region (Cameroon)|North]] ({{lang|fr|''Nord''}}), and [[Adamawa Region|Adamawa]] ({{lang|fr|''Adamaoua''}}). Directly south of them are the [[Centre Region (Cameroon)|Centre]] ({{lang|fr|''Centre''}}) and [[East Region (Cameroon)|East]] ({{lang|fr|''Est''}}). The [[South Region (Cameroon)|South Province]] ({{lang|fr|''Sud''}}) lies on the Gulf of Guinea and the southern border. Cameroon's western region is split into four smaller regions: the [[Littoral Region (Cameroon)|Littoral]] ({{lang|fr|''Littoral''}}) and [[Southwest Region (Cameroon)|Southwest]] ({{lang|fr|''Sud-Ouest''}}) regions are on the coast, and the [[Northwest Region (Cameroon)|Northwest]] ({{lang|fr|''Nord-Ouest''}}) and [[West Region (Cameroon)|West]] ({{lang|fr|''Ouest''}}) regions are in the western grassfields.<ref name=unhchr/>

At {{convert|475442|km2|sqmi}}, Cameroon is the world's 53rd-largest country.<ref name="Demographic Yearbook"/> It is comparable in size to [[Papua New Guinea]] and somewhat larger than the U.S. state of California.<ref name="CIA"/><ref name=Area/> The country is located in [[Central Africa|Central]] and West Africa on the [[Bight of Bonny]], part of the [[Gulf of Guinea]] and the Atlantic Ocean.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.international.ucla.edu/africa/countries/|accessdate=12 April 2013|title=Country Profiles|publisher=UCLA African Studies Center}}</ref> Cameroon lies between latitudes [[1st parallel north|1<U+00B0>]] and [[13th parallel north|13<U+00B0>N]], and longitudes [[8th meridian east|8<U+00B0>]] and [[17th meridian east|17<U+00B0>E]].

Tourist literature describes Cameroon as "Africa in miniature" because it exhibits all major climates and vegetation of the continent: coast, desert, mountains, rainforest, and savanna.<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 16.</ref> The country's neighbours are Nigeria to the west; [[Chad]] to the northeast; the [[Central African Republic]] to the east; and [[Equatorial Guinea]], Gabon, and the [[Republic of the Congo]] to the south.<ref name="CIA"/>

Cameroon is divided into five major geographic zones distinguished by dominant physical, climatic, and vegetative features. The coastal plain extends {{convert|15|to|150|km|mi|0}} inland from the Gulf of Guinea<ref name=Fomensky/> and has an average elevation of {{convert|90|m|ft|0}}.<ref>[[#Neba|Neba]] 14.</ref> Exceedingly hot and humid with a short [[dry season]], this belt is densely forested and includes some of the [[Debundscha|wettest places]] on earth, part of the [[Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests]].<ref>[[#Neba|Neba]] 28.</ref><ref name=Extremes/>

The southern plateau rises northward to the grassy, rugged [[Adamawa Plateau]]. This feature stretches from the western mountain area and forms a barrier between the country's north and south. Its average elevation is {{convert|1100|m|ft|0}},<ref name="Neba 16"/> and its average temperature ranges from {{convert|22|C|F|1}} to {{convert|25|C|F}} with high rainfall between April and October peaking in July and August.<ref name=Gwanfogbe/><ref>[[#Neba|Neba]] 29.</ref> The [[East Sudanian savanna|northern lowland region]] extends from the edge of the Adamawa to Lake Chad with an average elevation of {{convert|300|to|350|m|ft|0}}.<ref name="Neba 17"/> Its characteristic vegetation is savanna scrub and grass. This is an arid region with sparse rainfall and high median temperatures.<ref name=Green/>

Cameroon has four patterns of drainage. In the south, the principal rivers are the [[Ntem River|Ntem]], [[Nyong River|Nyong]], [[Sanaga River|Sanaga]], and Wouri. These flow southwestward or westward directly into the Gulf of Guinea. The [[Dja River|Dja]] and [[Kad<U+00E9><U+00EF> River|Kad<U+00E9><U+00EF>]] drain southeastward into the [[Congo River]]. In northern Cameroon, the [[Benue River|B<U+00E9>nou<U+00E9> River]] runs north and west and empties into the [[Niger River|Niger]]. The [[Logon River|Logone]] flows northward into Lake Chad, which Cameroon shares with three neighbouring countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Country Files: Cameroon|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/T0360E/T0360E04.htm|publisher=UN Food and Agriculture Organization|accessdate=3 March 2013}}</ref>

{{Main|Economy of Cameroon}}

Cameroon's per-capita GDP ([[Purchasing power parity]]) was estimated as US$2,300 in 2008,<ref name="CIA"/> one of the ten highest in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].<ref name="Musa Biya plan"/> Major [[export]] markets include France, Italy, South Korea, Spain, and the United Kingdom.<ref name="CIA"/> Cameroon is aiming to become an emerging country by 2035.

Cameroon has had a decade of strong economic performance, with GDP growing at an average of 4% per year. During the 2004<U+2013>2008 period, public debt was reduced from over 60% of GDP to 10% and official reserves quadrupled to over USD 3&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfw4a.org/cameroon/cameroon-financial-sector-profile.html|title=Cameroon Financial Sector Profile|publisher=MFW4A|accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref> Cameroon is part of the [[Bank of Central African States]] (of which it is the dominant economy),<ref name="Musa Biya plan"/> the [[Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa]] (UDEAC) and the [[Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa]] (OHADA).<ref name="ohada.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.ohada.com/index.php|title=The business law portal in Africa|publisher=OHADA|accessdate=22 March 2009}}</ref> Its currency is the [[CFA franc]].<ref name="CIA"/>

Unemployment was estimated at 30% in 2001, and about a third of the population was living below the international [[poverty threshold]] of US$1.25 a day in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDI_2008_EN_Tables.pdf|work=Human Development Indices|title= Table 3: Human and income poverty|page=35|accessdate=1 June 2009|publisher=UN}}</ref> Since the late 1980s, Cameroon has been following programmes advocated by the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) to reduce poverty, privatise industries, and increase economic growth.<ref name="State Dept"/> The government has taken measures to encourage [[Tourism in Cameroon|tourism]] in the country.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://nl.nabc.nl/Portals/0/docs/Country%20information%20pdf/CAMEROON%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf | title=Cameroon Business Mission Fact Sheet 20010-2011 | publisher=Netherlands-African Business Council | year=2011}}</ref>

Cameroon's natural resources are very well suited to agriculture and arboriculture. An estimated 70% of the population farms, and agriculture comprised an estimated 19.8% of GDP in 2009.<ref name="CIA"/> Most agriculture is done at the subsistence scale by local farmers using simple tools. They sell their surplus produce, and some maintain separate fields for commercial use. Urban centres are particularly reliant on peasant agriculture for their foodstuffs. Soils and climate on the coast encourage extensive commercial cultivation of bananas, cocoa, oil palms, rubber, and tea. Inland on the South Cameroon Plateau, cash crops include coffee, sugar, and tobacco. Coffee is a major cash crop in the western highlands, and in the north, natural conditions favour crops such as cotton, groundnuts, and rice. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Cameroon vulnerable to shifts in their prices.<ref name="CIA"/>

[[File:Fulani herd in the dust.jpg|thumb|A [[Fula people|Fulani]] herder drives his cattle in northern Cameroon.]]

The southern rainforest has vast timber reserves, estimated to cover 37% of Cameroon's total land area.<ref name=awf/> However, large areas of the forest are difficult to reach. Logging, largely handled by foreign-owned firms,<ref name=awf/> provides the government US$60&nbsp;million a year as of 1998, and laws mandate the safe and sustainable exploitation of timber. Nevertheless, in practice, the industry is one of the least regulated in Cameroon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/where_we_work/congo_basin_forests/problems/deforestation/logging/|publisher=WWF|accessdate=12 April 2013|title=Logging in the Green Heart of Africa}}</ref>

Factory-based industry accounted for an estimated 29.7% of GDP in 2009.<ref name="CIA"/> More than 75% of Cameroon's industrial strength is located in [[Douala]] and [[Bonab<U+00E9>ri]]. Cameroon possesses substantial mineral resources, but these are not extensively [[mining in Cameroon|mined]].<ref name="State Dept"/> Petroleum exploitation has fallen since 1986, but this is still a substantial sector such that dips in prices have a strong effect on the economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/pdp/2006/pdp02.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2013|title=Strengthening Transparency in the Oil Sector in Cameroon|author=Coss<U+00E9>, St<U+00E9>phane |publisher=IMF|year=2006}}</ref> Rapids and waterfalls obstruct the southern rivers, but these sites offer opportunities for hydroelectric development and supply most of Cameroon's energy. The Sanaga River powers the largest hydroelectric station, located at Ed<U+00E9>a. The rest of Cameroon's energy comes from oil-powered thermal engines. Much of the country remains without reliable power supplies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.climateparl.net/cpcontent/pdfs/Kribi,%202010-03-27,%20Parlementarians.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2013|title=Harnessing Central Africa's Hydropower Potential|author=Prevost, Yves|publisher=Climate Parliament}}</ref>

[[Transport in Cameroon]] is often difficult. Except for the several relatively good [[toll road]]s which connect major cities (all of them one-lane) roads are poorly maintained and subject to inclement weather, since only 10% of the roadways are tarred.<ref name="CIA"/> Roadblocks often serve little other purpose than to allow police and gendarmes to collect bribes from travellers.<ref>[[#Hudgens|Hudgens and Trillo]] 1036.</ref> Road banditry has long hampered transport along the eastern and western borders, and since 2005, the problem has intensified in the east as the [[Central African Republic]] has further destabilised.<ref name="Musa Gunmen"/>

Intercity bus services run by multiple private companies connect all major cities. They are the most popular means of transportation followed by the rail service ''[[Camrail]]''. Rail service runs from [[Kumba]] in the west to [[B<U+00E9>labo]] in the east and north to [[Ngaound<U+00E9>r<U+00E9>]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtravelguide.net/cameroon/getting-around|accessdate=12 April 2013|publisher=World Travel Guide|title=Getting around Cameroon}}</ref> International airports are located in [[Douala]] and [[Yaound<U+00E9>]], with a third under construction in [[Maroua]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20130509073605/http://www.cameroononline.org/2013/04/03/equipments-for-the-future-maroua-international-airport/|accessdate=12 April 2013|title=Equipment for the Future Maroua International Airport|publisher=Cameroon Online|date=3 April 2013}}</ref> Douala is the country's principal seaport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soschildrensvillages.ca/where-we-help/africa/cameroon/douala/pages/default.aspx|accessdate=12 April 2013|title=SOS Children's Village Douala|publisher=SOS Children's Villages}}</ref> In the north, the B<U+00E9>nou<U+00E9> River is seasonally navigable from Garoua across into Nigeria.<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 68.</ref>

Cameroon has a high level of [[Religion in Cameroon|religious freedom]] and diversity.<ref name="Human Rights Report"/> The predominant faith is [[Christianity]], practiced by about two-thirds of the population, while [[Islam]] is a significant minority faith, adhered to by about one-fifth. In addition, traditional faiths are practiced by many. Muslims are most concentrated in the north, while Christians are concentrated primarily in the southern and western regions, but practitioners of both faiths can be found throughout the country.<ref name=IRFR/> Large cities have significant populations of both groups.<ref name=IRFR/> Muslims in Cameroon are divided into [[Sunnis]], [[Shia]]s, [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadis]], [[Sufi]]s, and [[non-denominational Muslims]]<ref>Pew Forum on Religious & Public life. 9 August 2012. Retrieved 29 October 2013</ref>

People from the North-West and South-West provinces are largely Protestant, and the French-speaking regions of the southern and western regions are largely Catholic.<ref name=IRFR/> Southern ethnic groups predominantly follow Christian or traditional African [[Animism|animist]] beliefs, or a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] combination of the two. People widely believe in witchcraft, and the government outlaws such practices.<ref name=Geschiere/> Suspected witches are often subject to mob violence.<ref name="Human Rights Report"/> The Islamist jihadist group Boko Haram has been reported as operating in North Cameroon.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22538888 Boko Haram timeline: From preachers to slave raiders]. ''BBC''. 15 May 2013. retrieved 19 June 2013</ref>

In the northern regions, the locally dominant Fulani ethnic group is mostly Muslim, but the overall population is fairly evenly divided among Muslims, Christians, and followers of indigenous religious beliefs (called ''[[Kirdi]]'' ("pagan") by the Fulani).<ref name=IRFR/> The [[Bamum people|Bamum]] ethnic group of the West Region is largely Muslim.<ref name=IRFR/> Native traditional religions are practiced in rural areas throughout the country but rarely are practiced publicly in cities, in part because many indigenous religious groups are intrinsically local in character.<ref name=IRFR/>

Traditional arts and crafts are practiced throughout the country for commercial, decorative, and religious purposes.

Traditional housing styles make use of locally available materials and vary from temporary wood-and-leaf shelters of nomadic [[Wodaabe|Mbororo]] to the rectangular mud-and-thatch homes of southern peoples. Dwellings made from materials such as cement and tin are increasingly common.<ref>[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 110<U+2013>3.</ref> [[Contemporary art]] is mainly promoted by independent cultural organizations ([[Doual'art]], [[Africr<U+00E9>a]]) and artist-run initiatives ([[Art Wash]], [[Atelier Viking]], [[ArtBakery]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.postzambia.com/post-read_article.php?articleId=8690|accessdate=12 April 2013|work=The Post|author=Mulenga, Andrew|date=30 April 2010|title=Cameroon's indomitable contemporary art}}</ref>

[[File:Cameroon vs Germany 2003.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] faces [[Germany national football team|Germany]] at [[Zentralstadion]] in Leipzig, 27 April 2003.]]
Cameroonian literature and [[list of Cameroonian films|film]] have concentrated on both European and African themes. Colonial-era writers such as [[Louis-Marie Pouka]] and [[Sankie Maimo]] were educated by European missionary societies and advocated [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] into European culture as the means to bring Cameroon into the modern world.<ref>[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 80<U+2013>1</ref> After World War II, writers such as [[Mongo Beti]] and [[Ferdinand Oyono]] analysed and criticised colonialism and rejected assimilation.<ref name=Fitzpatrick/><ref>[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 77, 83<U+2013>4</ref><ref name=Volet/>

Shortly after independence, filmmakers such as [[Jean-Paul Ngassa]] and [[Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se Sita-Bella]] explored similar themes.<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 119<U+2013>20</ref>[[#West|West]] 20.</ref> In the 1960s, Mongo Beti and other writers explored post-colonialism, problems of African development, and the recovery of African identity.<ref>[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 85<U+2013>6.</ref> Meanwhile, in the mid-1970s, filmmakers such as [[Jean-Pierre Dikongu<U+00E9> Pipa]] and [[Daniel Kamwa]] dealt with the conflicts between traditional and post-colonial society. Literature and films during the next two decades concentrated more on wholly Cameroonian themes.<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 120.</ref>

National policy strongly advocates sport in all forms. Traditional sports include canoe racing and wrestling, and several hundred runners participate in the {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Mount Cameroon Race of Hope]] each year.<ref>[[#West|West]] 127.</ref> Cameroon is one of the few tropical countries to have [[Cameroon at the 2002 Winter Olympics|competed]] in the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]]. However, [[sport in Cameroon]] is dominated by association football (soccer). Amateur football clubs abound, organised along ethnic lines or under corporate sponsors. The [[Cameroon national football team]] has been one of the most successful in Africa since its strong showing in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]. Cameroon has won four [[African Cup of Nations]] titles and the gold medal at the [[Football at the 2000 Summer Olympics <U+2013> Men's tournament|2000 Olympics]].<ref>[[#West|West]] 92<U+2013>3, 127.</ref>
