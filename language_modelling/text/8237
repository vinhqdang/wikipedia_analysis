'''Western Australia''' is [[Australia]]'s largest [[States and territories of Australia|state]] in area, covering the western third of the mainland, and is bordered by [[South Australia]] and the [[Northern Territory]]. It is, after the [[Sakha Republic]] in [[Russia]], the second largest [[subnational entity]] in the world. Despite this the population is only 2,105,800, making up 10% of Australia's total population.

The people of Western Australia are often colloquially referred to as [[Sandgroper (insect)|sandgroper]]s because of the insect found on sand dunes around [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]].<ref>[http://www.museum.wa.gov.au/collections/natscience/invertebrates/sandgropers.asp Western Australian Museum - Sandgroper]</ref>

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Western Australia}}
===Geology===
The bulk of Western Australia consists of the extremely old [[Yilgarn craton]] and [[Pilbara craton]] which merged with the [[Deccan]] of [[India]], [[Madagascar]] and the [[Karoo]] and [[Zimbabwe]] cratons of [[Southern Africa]], in the [[Archean]] Eon to form [[Ur (continent)|Ur]], one of the oldest [[Supercontinent]]s on Earth (3,200-3,000 million years ago). Because the only [[orogeny|mountain-building]] since then has been of the [[Stirling Range]] with the rifting from [[Antarctica]], the land is extremely eroded and ancient, with no part of the state above 1,245 metres (4,085&nbsp;ft) [[Australian Height Datum|AHD]] (at [[Mount Meharry]] in the [[Hamersley Range]] of the [[Pilbara]] region). Most parts of the state form a low [[plateau]] with an average elevation of about 400 metres (1,200&nbsp;ft), very low relief, and no surface runoff. This descends relatively sharply to the coastal plains, in some cases forming a sharp escarpment (as with the Darling Range/[[Darling Scarp]] near Perth).

The extreme age of the landscape has meant that the [[soil]]s are remarkably infertile and frequently [[laterite|laterised]]. Even soils derived from [[granite|granitic]] [[bedrock]] contain an order of magnitude less available [[phosphorus]] and only half as much [[nitrogen]] as soils in comparable climates in other [[continent]]s. Soils derived from extensive [[sand]]plains or [[ironstone]] are even less fertile, being even more devoid of soluble phosphate and also deficient in [[zinc]], [[copper]], [[molybdenum]] and sometimes [[potassium]] and [[calcium]].

[[Image:WAHighways.png|thumb|right|260px|Western Australian cities, towns, settlements and [[List of highways in Western Australia|road network]]]]

The infertility of most of the soils has required heavy inputs of chemical fertilisers, particularly [[superphosphate]], [[insecticide]]s and [[herbicide]]s, which&mdash;with the ensuing damage to [[invertebrate]] and [[bacteria]]l populations, and [[soil compaction|compaction of soils]] through heavy machinery and hoofed mammals&mdash;has done great damage to the fragile soils.  The massive clearing of the land has damaged habitats for native flora and fauna, making the [[Southwest Australia|South West region]] of the state that with the greatest percentage of rare, threatened or endangered flora and fauna in Australia, and it is one of the biodiversity "hot spots" in the world. It has also led to major problems with [[salinity|dryland salinity]] and the loss of fresh water.

===Climate===
The [[Southwest corner of Western Australia|southwest coastal area]] is relatively [[temperate]] and was originally heavily forested, including large stands of the [[karri]], one of the tallest trees in the world. This agricultural region of Western Australia is in the top nine terrestrial habitats for terrestrial [[biodiversity]], with a higher proportion of [[endemic species]] than most other equivalent regions. Thanks to the offshore [[Leeuwin Current]] the area numbers in the top six regions for marine biodiversity, containing the most southerly [[coral reef]]s in the world. 

Annual rainfall varies from 300 millimetres (12&nbsp;[[Inch|in]]) at the edge of the [[Wheatbelt (Western Australia)|Wheatbelt]] region to 1,400 millimetres (55&nbsp;in) in the wettest areas near Northcliffe, but in the months of November to March evaporation exceeds rainfall, and it is generally very dry. Plants must be adapted to this as well as the extreme poverty of all soils. A major reduction in rainfall has been observed, with a greater number of rainfall events in the summer months.

The central four-fifths of the state is [[semi-arid]] or [[desert]] and is lightly inhabited with the only significant activity being [[mining]]. Annual rainfall averages about 200 to 250 millimetres (8&ndash;10&nbsp;in) but is very erratic because most of it is produced in torrential falls by [[tropical cyclone|cyclones]] in the summer months that are often unreliable.

An exception to this is the northern [[tropical]] regions. The [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] has an extremely hot [[monsoon]]al climate with average annual rainfall ranging from 500 to 1,500 millimetres (20&ndash;60&nbsp;in), but there is a very long almost rainless season from April to November. Eighty-five percent of the state's [[runoff (water)|runoff]] occurs in the Kimberley, but because it occurs in violent [[flood]]s and because of the insurmountable poverty of the generally shallow soils, the only development has taken place along the [[Ord River]].

Snow is only a regular occurrence on the [[Stirling Range]] near [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]], as it is the only mountain range far enough south and with sufficient elevation. More rarely, snow can fall on the [[Porongurup National Park|Porongurup Range]]. Snow outside these areas is a major event; it usually occurs in hilly areas of southwestern Australia. The most widespread low-level snow occurred on [[26 June]] [[1956]] when snow was reported in the [[Perth Hills]], as far north as [[Wongan Hills, Western Australia|Wongan Hills]] and as far east as [[Salmon Gums, Western Australia|Salmon Gums]]. However, even in the Stirling Range, snowfalls rarely exceed 5 cm (2 in) and rarely settle for more than one day.<ref>[http://www.feargod.net/wa-snow1.php Snow in Western Australia: About Snow in WA], retrieved [[4 February]] [[2007]]</ref>

The highest observed maximum temperature of 50.5&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (122.9&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) occurred at [[Mardie, Western Australia|Mardie]], [[Pilbara]], 61.6&nbsp;kilometres (38.3&nbsp;mi) from [[Barrow Island, Western Australia|Barrow Island]] on [[19 February]] [[1998]]. The lowest minimum temperature was -6.7&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (19.9&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) at [[Booylgoo Springs, Western Australia|Booylgoo Springs]], 187.3&nbsp;kilometres (116.4&nbsp;mi) from [[Meekatharra, Western Australia|Meekatharra]] on [[12 July]] [[1969]].<ref>http://members.iinet.net.au/~jacob/worldtp.html</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Western Australia|Aboriginal history of Western Australia}}
[[Image:John Forrest 1898.jpg|thumbnail|170px|[[John Forrest]] was the first Premier of Western Australia]]

The first inhabitants of Australia arrived from the north approximately 40,000 to 60,000 years ago. Over thousands of years they eventually spread across the whole landmass. These [[Indigenous Australians]] were well established throughout Western Australia by the time European ships started accidentally arriving en-route to Batavia (now [[Jakarta]]) in the early seventeenth century.

The first European to visit Western Australia was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] explorer, [[Dirk Hartog]] who on [[26 October]] [[1616]] landed at (what is now known as) Cape Inscription, Dirk Hartog Island. For the rest of the 17th century there were many other Dutch travellers who also, usually unintentionally, encountered the coast. By the late 18th century, [[Great Britain|British]] and [[France|French]] sailors had also begun to explore the Western Australian coast.

The origins of the present state began with the establishment of a British settlement at [[King George Sound]] in 1826 (later named [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] from 1832). The settlement was founded in response to concern about the possibility of a French colony being established on the coast of Western Australia.

In 1829, the [[Swan River Colony]] was established on the Swan River by Captain [[James Stirling (Australian governor)|James Stirling]]. By 1832, the British settler population of the colony had reached around 1,500. The two separate townsites of the colony developed slowly into the port city of [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] and the Western Australian capital city Perth. 

Population growth was very slow until significant discoveries of [[gold]] were made in the 1890s around [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|Kalgoorlie]].

In 1887, a new constitution including the right of self-governance was drafted and in 1890, the act granting [[self-governing colony|self-government]] to the colony was passed by the [[British House of Commons]]. [[John Forrest]] became the first [[Premier of Western Australia]].

In 1896, the [[Western Australian Parliament]] authorised the raising of a loan to construct a pipeline to cart five million gallons of water per day to the goldfields of Western Australia. The pipeline is known as the [[Goldfields Water Supply Scheme]], and it was completed in 1903. [[C.Y. O'Connor]], who was Western Australia<U+2019>s first engineer-in-chief, designed and constructed what is still considered today<U+2019>s longest water main.  It carries water 530 km (330 miles) from [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] to [[Kalgoorlie]]. Many historians attribute Western Australia<U+2019>s growth to the pipeline.<ref >{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A110059b.htm |title=''O'Connor, Charles Yelverton (1843-1902)''  |author=Tauman, Merab Harris |work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], Volume 1 |publisher=[[Melbourne University Press|MUP]] |year=1988 |pages=pp 51<U+2013>54 |accessdate=12 July 2008}}</ref>

Following a campaign led by Forrest, residents of the Colony voted in favour of the [[Federation of Australia]] and became a State of Australia on [[1 January]] [[1901]].

==Demographics==
[[Image:Swan River,Perth,Western Australia.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Western Australia's capital city, [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], on the Swan River, home to three quarters of the state's population]]

The first inhabitants of what is now Western Australia were [[Indigenous Australians]], from a wide variety of language and kin groups &mdash; for example, the [[Nyungah]] in the southwest, the [[Wongai]] in the central desert, the [[Malkana]] in [[Shark Bay]]. These groups retain significant presences throughout the state and, in some areas &mdash; e.g., the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] &mdash; continue to form the majority of the local population.

[[Europe]]ans began to settle permanently in 1826 when [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] was founded by the British to forestall French claims to the western third of the continent. Perth was founded as the [[Swan River Colony]] in 1829 by [[British people|British]] and [[Irish Australian|Irish]] settlers, though the outpost languished, eventually requesting [[Convictism in Australia|convict]] labour to augment its population. Even with this, Western Australia did not receive significant flows of [[Immigration to Australia|migrants]] from [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Ireland]] or elsewhere in the [[British Empire]] until the early twentieth century when local projects &mdash; such as the Group Settlement Scheme of the 1920s which encouraged farmers to settle the southwest &mdash; increased awareness of Australia's western third as a destination for colonists. Western Australia also benefitted demographically from a mining boom in the [[Goldfields-Esperance|Goldfields]] underpinned by interstate migration from the 1890s onward.

[[Image:WAflag.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Western Australian flag at the State War Memorial, Kings Park]]

Led by migrants from the British Isles, Western Australia's population developed exponentially during the twentieth century, though at a much slower pace than other parts of Australia. Nonetheless, like the eastern states, Western Australia received large numbers of [[Italian Australian|Italians]], [[Croatian Australian|Yugoslavs]] and [[Greek Australian|Greeks]] after [[World War II]]. Despite this, settlers from Britain have contributed the greatest number of migrants to this day, and Western Australia &mdash; particularly Perth &mdash; has the highest proportion of British-born of any state: 10.9% in 2001, compared to a national average of 5.3%. This group is heavily concentrated in certain parts of the [[metropolitan area]] such as [[Joondalup, Western Australia|Joondalup]] where they account for a quarter of the population.

In terms of ethnic groups, 2001 census data reveal that Western Australia is highly diverse: the largest single group was those reporting English ancestry or ethnicity, accounting for 733,783 responses (32.7%), followed by Australian with 624,259 (27.8%), [[Irish Australian|Irish]] with 171,667 (7.6%), [[Italian Australian|Italian]] with 96,721 (4.3%), [[Scottish people|Scottish]] with 62,781 (2.8%), [[German Australian|German]] with 51,672 (%) and [[Chinese Australian|Chinese]] with 48,894 responses (2.2%). There were 58,496 Indigenous Australians in Western Australia in 2001, forming 3.1% of the population.

In terms of birthplace, according to the 2006 census <ref>[http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation/prenav/ViewData?&action=401&tabname=Summary&areacode=5&issue=2006&producttype=QuickStats&textversion=true&navmapdisplayed=true&&breadcrumb=PLD& 2006 Census QuickStats: Western Australia, October 2007]</ref> 27.1% of the population were born overseas &mdash; higher than the Australian average of 22.2%. 8.9% of West Australians were born in [[England]], 2.4% were born in [[New Zealand]], 1.2% were born in [[Scotland]], 1.1% were born in [[South Africa]], and 1.1% were born in [[Italy]].

Perth's metropolitan area had an estimated population of 1.50 million in 2006 which was almost three quarters of the state's population. The Perth metropolitan area has grown to include the port of [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] and the town of [[Rockingham, Western Australia|Rockingham]]. Other important or well-known centres include [[Mandurah, Western Australia|Mandurah]], [[Bunbury, Western Australia|Bunbury]] (the fastest growing city/town in Australia as of 2008), [[Kalgoorlie]], [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]], [[Geraldton, Western Australia|Geraldton]], [[Port Hedland, Western Australia|Port Hedland]] and [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]], but these are all relatively small cities or towns.

==Economy==
{{seealso|Mining in Western Australia}}
[[Image:HayStreetPerth01 gobeirne.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hay Street, Perth]]
[[Image:Aerial view of Fremantle.JPG|thumbnail|right|250px|Aerial view of Fremantle Harbour, a major port in WA]]

Western Australia has the highest per capita output of any Australian state, with an economy that has been largely based on the extraction and export of mining and [[petroleum]] commodities, especially, [[iron]], [[alumina]], [[natural gas]], [[nickel]] and [[gold]]. Western Australia is a leading alumina extractor, producing more than 20% of the world's [[alumina]]. It is also the world's third-largest iron ore producer, producing around 15% of the world's total iron ore output. Western Australia extracts up to 75% of Australia's 240 tonnes of [[gold]]. Diamonds are extracted at [[Argyle diamond mine]] in the North West. [[Lignite|Coal]] is mined at [[Collie, Western Australia|Collie]] and used for domestic power production.

Western Australia's economy recently has benefited from an unprecedented amount of foreign demand for resources, particularly from [[China]]. This has contributed to strong [[Gross state product|GSP]] growth.<ref>[http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@archive.nsf/log?openagent&5220001_Annual_Gross_State_Product_All_States.xls&5220.0&Time%20Series%20Spreadsheet&EA12DD28F5551158CA257221001A0D89&0&2005-06%20Reissue&13.11.2006&Latest 5220.0 Gross state product, Chain volume measures and current prices]</ref> Perth has emerged as a significant administration centre for businesses in the mineral and oil and gas industries.

Agricultural exports are also important (amounting to approximately 3% of GSP), especially wheat, barley and sheep products such as wool and meat. Approximately 50% of Australia's live cattle exports come from Western Australia. In recent years, [[Tourism in Australia|tourism]] has grown in importance, with the majority of visitors coming from the United Kingdom and Ireland, [[Singapore]], [[Japan]] and [[Malaysia]].

Western Australia, with about 10% of Australia's population, has historically generated approximately 30% of Australia's export revenues, however the recent commodities boom has pushed this figure to now exceed 40%. The state generates more export income than [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (Australia's two most populous states) combined. High incomes, strong corporate activity, lower unemployment, mineral revenue and a younger population mean that Western Australia provides a significant financial subsidy to all other states. The economic boom in Western Australia is so strong that a significant labour shortage has emerged. The state government has launched an appeal for more people to move to the growing state at [http://www.gowestnow.com www.gowestnow.com]. Very high levels of job vacancies have emerged and unless skilled workers can be found, the state government fears that significant economic opportunities may be lost. According to the 2006 census<ref>[http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation/prenav/ViewData?&action=401&tabname=Summary&areacode=5&issue=2006&producttype=QuickStats&textversion=true&navmapdisplayed=true&&breadcrumb=PLD&#Income 2006 Census QuickStats: Western Australia, October 2007]</ref>, the median individual income was A$500 per week in Western Australia (compared to A$466 in Australia as a whole). The median family income was A$1246 per week (compared to A$1171 for Australia). 

This boom has also caused a massive rise in property values. Average residential property increased in value by over 40% in 2006, however values have remained rather flat in 2007. Perth property is now the second most valuable in Australia behind [[Sydney]]. Large projects continue to fuel the economy, and population growth continues to push rental prices up.

Significant refining and manufacturing industries are located within the state and are continuing to grow strongly with the state's booming economy. These include [[Liquified natural gas]] production mainly for export to Asia, petrochemicals and fertilizer production in the North West Shelf region. In September 2007, [[Hu Jintao]], the president of China, visited Western Australia and committed to the purchase of AUD$45 billion worth of gas over a lengthy period. This is the largest export contract Australia has ever had.

A major heavy industrial area is located south of Perth at [[Kwinana]]. Oil refining is conducted here along with an [[iron]] plant owned by Rio Tinto. Alumina and [[nickel]] are also produced in Kwinana. Shipbuilding is conducted at [[Austal Ships|Austal]] yards in [[Henderson, Western Australia|Henderson]] south of Fremantle. Several heavy and light engineering and metal fabrication factories are located in Perth catering for the demands of the mining industry. Other light industries include cement and building product manufacturing, flour milling, food processing, animal feed production, automotive body building, printing and boat building.

Several major along with smaller specialised breweries are located mainly in Perth including Swan Brewery at Canning Vale, Carlton United Brewing at Mosman Bay others include Little Creatures Brewery in Fremantle and Gage Roads Brewery also Fremantle. Western Australia also has major wine producing regions in the South West located in the [[Margaret River]] region and Swan Valley. Several wineries produce wine for local consumption and international export.

Western Australia has a significant fishing industry that produces fish for local consumption and foreign export including Western [[Rock Lobsters]], prawns, crabs, shark and tuna. Processing is conducted along the west coast. Whaling ceased at [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] in 1978.

Perth is a centre for banking and finance and includes state head offices for all major banks, [[Commonwealth Bank|Commonwealth]], [[National Australia Bank]], [[Westpac]] and [[Australia and New Zealand Banking Group|ANZ]]. It is also home to the Head Office of [[Woodside Petroleum]] and has major offices for [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]], BHP and [[Western Mining Corporation]]. Perth is Australia's main centre for mining and oil and gas administration.  Several insurance companies have large offices in Perth including [[AXA]], [[Aviva]], [[AMP Limited|AMP]] and [[SGIO]].
[[Image:Kalgoorlie Super Pit.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kalgoorlie Super Pit, Australia's largest open-cut gold mine]]
Since Perth is the only major capital city in Australia in which it is possible to contact Europe during normal business hours and is in the same time zone as [[Singapore]], [[Manila]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Beijing]] and [[Seoul]], Perth does an enormous amount of trading between the close of North American and the opening of European Stock Exchanges, and with Asia. 
Perth has the biggest retail sector in the state with retail outlets being found mainly in Hay, Murray and Wellington Streets. Several large shopping malls are located in the suburbs at Garden City, Karrinyup, Morley and Cannington. Department stores include [[Myer]] and [[David Jones Limited|David Jones]]. Fremantle is also a retail centre catering for local and tourist needs.

==Government==
{{main|Government of Western Australia}}
[[Image:WAGovernmentHouse1crop gobeirne.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Government House, Western Australia]]

Western Australia was granted self-government in 1889 with a bicameral House of Parliament, located in Perth, consisting of the [[Western Australian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] (or ''lower house''), which has 57 members; and the [[Western Australian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] (or ''upper house''), which has 34 members. Suffrage is universal and compulsory for Australian citizens residing in Western Australia over 18 years of age.

With the federation of the Australian colonies in 1901, Western Australia became a state within Australia's [[Federation|federal]] structure; this involved ceding certain powers to the Commonwealth (or Federal) government in accordance with the Constitution; all powers not specifically granted to the Commonwealth remained solely with the State, however over time the Commonwealth has effectively expanded its powers through increasing control of taxation and financial distribution.

Whilst the sovereign of Western Australia is the Queen of Australia ([[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]), and executive power nominally vested in her State representative the [[Governor of Western Australia|Governor]] (currently [[Ken Michael]]), executive power is effectively administered by the premier and ministers. The premier is [[Alan Carpenter]] and ministers are drawn from the party or coalition of parties holding a majority of seats in the lower house of Parliament, (currently Labor).

===Secession===
{{main|Secessionism in Western Australia}}
Secessionism has been a recurring feature of Western Australia's political landscape since shortly after European settlement in 1826. Western Australia was the most reluctant participant in the [[Federation of Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]].<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MULR/2000/40.html Review Essay, New Federation History, Melbourne University Law Review] www.austlii.edu.au </ref> Western Australia did not participate in the earliest federation conference. Longer-term residents of Western Australia were generally opposed to federation; however, the discovery of gold brought many immigrants from other parts of Australia. It was these residents, primarily in Kalgoorlie but also in Albany who voted to join the Commonwealth, and the proposal of these areas being admitted separately was considered.

In a referendum in April 1933, 68% of voters voted for the state to leave the Commonwealth of Australia with the aim of returning to the [[British Empire]] as an autonomous territory. The State Government sent a delegation to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]], but the British Government refused to intervene and therefore no action was taken to implement this decision.

For social and cultural reasons the concept of secession is unlikely to be seriously considered in the future, even though  commentators occasionally raise the idea for economic reasons.

==Ecology==
[[Image:Black Swans.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[Black Swan]] is the state bird of Western Australia]]
[[Image:Kangaroo Paw.JPG|thumb|right|150px|The [[Anigozanthos manglesii|Red and Green Kangaroo Paw]] is the floral emblem of Western Australia]]

Western Australia is home to around [[List of Western Australian birds|540 species of birds]] (depending on the taxonomy used). Of these around 15 are [[endemic species|endemic]] to the state. The best areas for birds are the southwestern corner of the state and the area around Broome and the Kimberley.

In the southwest region are some of the largest numbers of plant species for its area in the world.

[[William Henry Harvey]] published a five-volume ''Phycologia Australia'' which was issued in parts between 1858 and 1863. He earned the title of ''father of Australian Phycology''. His main collection is in the [[herbarium]] of [[Trinity College Dublin]], there is also a large collection of his [[specimens]] in the [[Ulster Museum]], Belfast.

==Education==
Education in Western Australia consists of one year of pre-school at age 5, followed by seven years of primary school education. At age 13, students begin five years of secondary education. The final two years of secondary education are currently changing to compulsory. All students who completed Year 10 in 2005 are now required to undertake further studies in Year 11. Students are required to complete the year in which they turn 16 (usually Year 11).

Commencing in 2008 all students will be required to complete 12 years of study before leaving school. Students will have the option to study at a [[Technical and Further Education|TAFE]] college in their eleventh year or continue through high school with a vocational course or a specific University entrance course.

The universities in Western Australia are [[Curtin University of Technology]], [[Murdoch University]], [[Edith Cowan University]], [[University of Notre Dame Australia|University of Notre Dame]] and the [[University of Western Australia]].

==Media==
===Print===
Western Australia has two daily newspapers: the independent tabloid ''[[The West Australian]]'', ''Countryman'' and ''[[The Kalgoorlie Miner]]''.  Also published is one Sunday tabloid newspaper, [[News Corporation]]'s ''[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|The Sunday Times]]''.There are also 17 weekly ''[[Community Newspapers]]'' with distribution from Yanchep in the North to Mandurah in the South.However, the interstate broadsheet publication ''[[The Australian]]'' is also available, although with sales per capita lagging far behind those in other states. With the advent of the Internet, other online publications from around the world are now easily accessible. Some, like the New South Wales based ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''The Australian'' which provide free access to their sites, are becoming increasingly popular.

===Television===
Metropolitan Perth has six broadcast television stations;
