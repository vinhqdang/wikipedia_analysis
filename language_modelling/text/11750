'''Healthcare in Taiwan''' is administrated by the [[Department of Health (Republic of China)|Department of Health]] of the [[Executive Yuan]]. As with other [[Developed country|developed economies]], Taiwanese people are well-nourished but face such health problems as chronic [[obesity]] and [[heart disease]].<ref name=cp/> In 2002 [[Taiwan]] had nearly 1.6 physicians and 5.9 hospital beds per 1,000 population.<ref name=cp>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Taiwan.pdf|title=Taiwan country profile|publisher=[[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]]|date=March 2005|accessdate=2008-05-04}} ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''</ref> In 2002, there were a total 36 hospitals and 2,601 clinics in the country.

The current health care system in [[Taiwan]], known as '''National Health Insurance''' (NHI), was instituted in 1995. NHI is a [[Single-payer health care|single-payer]] compulsory social insurance plan which centralizes the disbursement of health-care funds. The system promises equal access to health care for all citizens, and the population coverage had reached 99% by the end of 2004.<ref>Fanchiang, Cecilia.[http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/site/Tj/ct.asp?xItem=20439&CtNode=122 "New IC health insurance card expected to offer many benefits"], ''Taiwan Journal, January 2nd, 2004'' Accessed March 28, 2008</ref> NHI is mainly financed through premiums, which are based on the payroll tax, and is supplemented with out-of-pocket payments and direct government funding. In the initial stage, fee-for-service predominated for both public and private providers. Most health providers operate in the private sector and form a competitive market on the health delivery side. However, many health care providers took advantage of the system by offering unnecessary services to a larger number of patients and then billing the government. In the face of increasing loss and the need for cost containment , NHI changed the payment system from fee-for-service to a global budget, a kind of prospective payment system, in 2002.

==Health care reform==
Taiwan started its health reform in the 1980s after experiencing two decades of economic growth.<ref name = sick>{{cite web | title = FRONTLINE: Sick Around the World | publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service]] | first = T.R.| last = Reid | url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/sickaroundtheworld/ | year=2008}}</ref> In 1987, the government did away with the [[martial law]] which mobilized the governmental departments. The government set up a planning commission and looked abroad to study other countries<U+2019> health care systems. Taiwan looked at more than ten countries and combined their best qualities to form their own unique system. In 1995, Taiwan formed the National Health Insurance (NHI) model. In a 2009 interview, Dr. Michael Chen, Vice President and CFO of Taiwan's National Health Insurance Bureau explained that one of the models investigated was the United States and that fundamentally, NHI "is modeled after (U.S.) Medicare. And there are so many similarities - other than that our program covers all of the population, and Medicare covers only the elderly. It seems the way to go to have social insurance."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.pnhp.org/news/2009/april/jonathan_cohn_interv.php|title=Jonathan Cohn interviews Taiwan's Dr. Michael Chen: The Case for Single-Payer Health Care (Transcript)}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web  |title=TRNtv:Jonathan Cohn interviews Taiwan's Dr. Michael Chen (Video)|url=http://player.theplatform.com/ps/player/pds/Knmmuhlp3e?pid=Vq2Q_9LKk_AhPrGSWCgdcBmcX6CwnZQn |accessdate=11 September 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> NHI delivers universal coverage offered by a government-run insurer. The working population pays premiums split with their employers, others pay a flat rate with government help and the poor or veterans are fully subsidized. Taiwan<U+2019>s citizens no longer have to worry about going bankrupt due to medical bills.<ref name=NPRart>{{cite news |title = Taiwan Takes Fastrack to Universal Health Care| url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89651916| publisher = All Things Considered, NPR| date = 2008-04-15 | accessdate = 2008-10-05}}</ref>

Under this model, citizens have free range to choose hospitals and physicians without using a gatekeeper and do not have to worry about waiting lists. NHI offers a comprehensive benefit package that covers preventive medical services, prescription drugs, [[Dentistry|dental]] services, [[Chinese medicine]], home nurse visits and many more. Working people do not have to worry about losing their jobs or changing jobs because they will not lose their insurance. Since NHI, the previously uninsured have increased their usage of medical services. Most preventive services are free such as annual checkups and maternal and child care. Regular office visits have co-payments as low as US $5 per visit. Co-payments are fixed and unvaried by the person<U+2019>s income.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = [[Health Affairs]] | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 77&ndash;88 | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.22.3.77 | title = Does Universal Health Insurance Make Health Care Unaffordable?

By 2001, 97 percent of the population were enrolled in the program. Every enrollee has a Health IC [[smart card]]. This credit-card-size card only contains 32 [[kilobytes]] of memory that includes provider and patient profiles to identify and reduce [[False_insurance_claims#Health_insurance_fraud|insurance fraud]], overcharges, duplication of services and tests.<ref>{{cite web|last=Chen|first=Yuh-Ning|title=Taiwan<U+2019>S Health IC Smart Card Security and Privacy Policy|accessdate=2008-03-16|date=September 2003|url=http://www.martsoft.com/reference/healthcare/tw_nhi_2003Sep.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> The physician puts the card into a reader and the patient<U+2019>s medical history and prescriptions come up on a computer screen. The insurer is billed the medical bill and it is automatically paid. Taiwan<U+2019>s single-payer insurer monitors standards, usage and quality of treatment for diagnosis by requiring the providers to submit a full report every 24 hours. This improves quality of treatment and limits physicians from over prescribing medications as well as keeps patients from abusing the system.<ref name=NPRart/>

Patients and [[Physician|doctors]] alike are satisfied with NHI. However, [[Physician|doctors]] have been more dissatisfied because fee premiums are controlled by the system as well as selection of services provided under the system. Also, doctors could be heavily penalized for a wide variety of reasons such as seeing too many patients or offering too much services even if patients and services were valid. Although patients' satisfaction has been in the 70 percent range. This system has led to protests by health care providers. At the beginning of 2006, satisfaction decreased to the mid-60 percent range because the program needed more money to cover its services. Since then, satisfaction has gone back to the 70 percent range. Enrollees are satisfied with more equal access to health care, have greater financial risk protection and have [[Equity (economics)|equity]] in health care financing.<ref name=NPRart/>

Taiwan has the lowest administration cost in the world of 2 percent.<ref name=NPRart/> Before NHI, Taiwan spent 4.7 to 4.8 percent on health care. A year after NHI, it increased spending to 5.39 percent. Prior to NHI, the average annual rate of increase every year was around 13 percent. Now, the annual rate of increase is around 5 percent.<ref name = sick/> Taiwan spends a little over 6 percent in GDP and less than US $900 per person.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/ian_williams/2007/10/taiwan_gets_healthy.html | date = 2007-10-07 | title = Taiwan gets healthy | author = Ian Williams | publisher = [[The Guardian]]}}</ref>

==Problems==
Even with all their success in their health care system, Taiwan has suffered some misfortunes. The government is not taking in enough money to cover the services it provides, so it is borrowing money from banks.<ref>{{cite news | author = Reid, T.R. | title = Taiwan Takes Fast Track to Universal Health Care | publisher = [[National Public Radio]] | date = 2008-04-15 | url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89651916}}</ref> The revenue base is capped so it does not keep pace with the increase in national income. Premiums are regulated by politicians<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lee, Lung-Sheng | title = Is the Multi-HMO System a Promising Candidate for National Health Insurance Reform in Taiwan? | journal = B>Quest | year = 1999 | url =http://www.westga.edu/~bquest/1999/hmo.html}}</ref> and they are afraid to raise premiums because of voters. The country is slow at adopting technology except for drugs. There is a low doctor-to-population ratio resulting in too many patients depending on too few doctors. Patients visit the doctor more frequently causing doctors to keep visits short to about 2 to 5 minutes per patient.<ref>{{cite news | author = Gunde, Richard | title = Healthcare in Taiwan: Opportunities and Success | publisher = [[UCLA]] | date = 2004-09-30 | url = http://www.international.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=15333}}</ref> There is no system to regulate systematic reporting of clinical performance, patient outcomes and adverse events.

== Health information technology==
Taiwan began implementing its health information network in the 1980s and continues to invest in HIT today, perfecting existing systems and incorporating new applications. Leaders in Taiwan acknowledge that HIT not only helps to provide efficient and safe medical care but will also play a significant role in sustaining the economy<U+2019>s national health insurance system. Currently, all hospitals and most clinics are connected to the Bureau of National Health Insurance through (BNHI) a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for e-claim purposes. Additionally, all residents use health smart cards that contain limited EHRs{{fact}}
