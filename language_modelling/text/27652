The '''European Commission''' (formally the '''Commission of the European Communities''') is the [[executive (government)|executive branch]] of the [[European Union]]. The body is responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, upholding the [[Treaties of the European Union|Union's treaties]] and the general day-to-day running of the Union.<ref name="Europa Institutions">{{cite web|title=Institutions of the EU: The European Commission|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref>

The Commission operates in the method of [[cabinet government]], with 27 [[European Commissioner|Commissioners]]. There is one Commissioner per [[European Union member state|member state]], though Commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state. One of the 27 is the [[President of the European Commission|Commission President]] (currently [[Jos<U+00E9> Manuel Dur<U+00E3>o Barroso]]) appointed by the [[European Council]] with the approval of the [[European Parliament]]. The present [[Barroso Commission]] took office in late 2004 and should serve a five-year term.<ref name="Europa Institutions"/>

The term "Commission" can mean either the college of Commissioners mentioned above, or the larger [[Institutions of the European Union|institution]]; including the administrative body of about 25,000 [[European Civil Service|European civil servants]] who are in departments called [[Directorate-General|Directorates-General]]. It is primarily based in the [[Berlaymont building]] of [[Brussels]] and its internal [[working language]]s are [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]].<ref name="Europa Institutions"/>
{{Politics of the European Union}}

==History==
{{main|History of the European Union}}
The European Commission derives from one of the five key institutions created in the [[supranational]] European Community system, following the proposal of [[Robert Schuman]], French Foreign Minister, on 9 May 1950. Originating in 1951 as the High Authority in the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], the Commission has undergone numerous changes in power and composition under various Presidents, involving three Communities.<ref name="ENA commission history">{{cite web|title = European Commission|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=3202|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref>

===Establishment===
The first Commission originated in 1951 as the nine-member "[[High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community|High Authority]]" under President [[Jean Monnet]] (see [[Monnet Authority]]). The High Authority was the [[supranational]] administrative executive of the new [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC). It took office first on 10 August 1952 in Luxembourg. In 1958 the [[Treaties of Rome]] had established two new communities alongside the ECSC: the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) and the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (Euratom). However their executives were called "Commissions" rather than "High Authorities".<ref name="ENA commission history"/> The reason for the change in name was the new relationship between the executive and the [[Council of the European Union|Council]]. Some states such as [[France]] expressed reservations over the power of the High Authority and wished to limit it giving more power to the Council rather than the new executives.<ref name="ENA Council history">{{cite web|publisher = [[European NAvigator]]|title = Council of the European Union|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=5604|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}</ref> 

[[Louis Armand]] led the [[Armand Commission|first Commission of Euratom]]. [[Walter Hallstein]] led the [[Hallstein Commission|first Commission of the EEC]], holding the first formal meeting on 16 January 1958 at the [[Castle of the Valley of the Duchess]]. It achieved agreement on a contentious cereal price accord as well as making a positive impression upon third countries when it made its international debut at the [[Kennedy Round]] of [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) negotiations.<ref name="LSE Chair">{{cite web|last=Ludlow|first=N|year=2006|publisher=[[London School of Economics]]|title = De-commissioning the Empty Chair Crisis: the Community institutions and the crisis of 1965-6|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2422/01/Decommisioningempty.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-09-24}}</ref> Hallstein notably began the consolidation of [[Law of the European Union|European law]] and started to have a notable impact on national legislation. Little heed was taken of his administration at first but, with help from the [[European Court of Justice]], his Commission stamped its authority solidly enough to allow future Commissions to be taken more seriously.<ref>{{cite book| last = Eppink | first = Derk-Jan | authorlink = Derk Jan Eppink |  coauthors = Ian Connerty (translator) | title = Life of a European Mandarin: Inside the Commission | publisher = Lannoo | edition = 1st edition  | location = Tielt, Belgium | year = 2007 | pages = p.221&ndash;2 | isbn = 978-9020970227 }}</ref> However, in 1965 accumulating differences between the French government of [[Charles de Gaulle]] and the other member states (over British entry, direct elections to Parliament, the [[Fouchet Plan]] and the budget) triggered the [[Hallstein Commission#Empty chair crisis|"empty chair" crisis]] ostensibly over proposals for the [[Common Agricultural Policy]]. Although the institutional crisis was solved the following year, it cost Etienne Hirsch his presidency of Euratom and later Walter Hallstein the EEC presidency despite otherwise being viewed as the most 'dynamic' leader until [[Jacques Delors]].<ref name="LSE Chair"/>

===Early development===
The three bodies co-existed until 1 July 1967 where, by means of the [[Merger Treaty]], they were combined into a single administration under President [[Jean Rey (politician)|Jean Rey]].<ref name="ENA commission history"/> Due to the merger the [[Rey Commission]] saw a temporary increase to fourteen members, although all future Commissions were reduced back down to nine following the formula of one member for small states and two for larger states.<ref name="ENA composition">{{cite web|title = Composition|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=3276|accessdate=2007-10-17}}</ref> The Rey Commission completed the Community's [[customs union]] in 1968 and campaigned for a more powerful, elected, [[European Parliament]].<ref name="Meet Rey">{{cite web|title = Discover the former Presidents: The Rey Commission|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/president/history/rey/index_en.htm|accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref> Despite Rey being the first President of the combined communities,  Hallstein is seen as the first President of the modern Commission.<ref name="ENA commission history"/>

The [[Malfatti Commission|Malfatti]] and [[Mansholt Commission]]s followed with work on monetary co-operation and the first [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]] to the north in 1973.<ref name="Meet Mansholt">{{cite web|title = Discover the former Presidents: The Mansholt Commission|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/president/history/mansholt/index_en.htm|accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref><ref name="Meet Malfatti">{{cite web|title = Discover the former Presidents: The Malfatti Commission|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/president/history/malfatti/index_en.htm|accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref> With that enlargement the Commission's membership increased to thirteen under the [[Ortoli Commission]] (the [[United Kingdom]] as a large member was granted two Commissioners), which dealt with the enlarged community during economic and international instability at that time.<ref name="ENA composition"/><ref name="Meet Ortoli">{{cite web|title = Discover the former Presidents: The Ortoli Commission|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/president/history/ortoli/index_en.htm|accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref> The external representation of the Community took a step forward when President [[Roy Jenkins]] became the first President to attend a [[G8]] summit on behalf of the Community.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.deljpn.ec.europa.eu/union/showpage_en_union.external.g8.php| title = EU and the G8| accessdate = 2007-09-25| publisher = European Commission}}</ref> Following the [[Jenkins Commission (EU)|Jenkins Commission]], [[Gaston Thorn]]'s [[Thorn Commission|Commission]] oversaw the Community's enlargement to the south, in addition to beginning work on the [[Single European Act]].<ref name="Meet Thorn">{{cite web|title = Discover the former Presidents: The Thorn Commission|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/president/history/thorn/index_en.htm|accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref>

===Delors and Santer===
One of the most notable Commissions was that headed by [[Jacques Delors]] (the [[Delors Commission]]), with later Presidents failing to achieve the same degree of personal recognition. Delors was seen as giving the Community a sense of direction and dynamism.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Burson-Marsteller]]|title=The new Commission - some initial thoughts|year=2004|url=http://www.bmbrussels.be/box_bmnewcomm.php|accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> Delors and his team are also considered as the "[[founding father]]s of the [[euro]]".<ref name="Meet Delors">{{cite web|title = Discover the former Presidents: The Delors Commission|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/president/history/delors/index_en.htm|accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref> The [[International Herald Tribune]] noted the work of Delors at the end of his second term in 1992: "Mr. Delors rescued the European Community from the doldrums. He arrived when Europessimism was at its worst. Although he was a little-known former French finance minister, he breathed life and hope into the EC and into the dispirited Brussels Commission. In his first term, from 1985 to 1988, he rallied Europe to the call of the single market, and when appointed to a second term he began urging Europeans toward the far more ambitious goals of economic, monetary and political union."<ref name="IHT Delors quote">{{cite web|last=Merritt|first=Giles|title =A Bit More Delors Could Revamp the Commission|publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=[[1992-01-21]]|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1992/01/21/edgi_0.php|accessdate=2007-10-17}}</ref>

The successor to Delors was [[Jacques Santer]]. However the entire [[Santer Commission]] was forced to resign in 1999 by the Parliament following allegations of fraud. That was the first time a Commission had been forced to resign ''en masse'' and represented a shift towards the Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|last = Topan|first=Angelina|title = The resignation of the Santer-Commission: the impact of 'trust' and 'reputation' |date=[[2002-09-30]]|publisher=European Integration Online Papers|url=http://eiop.or.at/eiop/pdf/2002-014.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref> However the Santer Commission did carry out work on the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] and the euro.<ref name="Meet Santer">{{cite web|title = Discover the former Presidents: The Santer Commission|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/president/history/santer/index_en.htm|accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref>

===Recent commissions===
Following Santer, [[Romano Prodi]] took office. The Amsterdam Treaty had increased the Commission's powers and Prodi was dubbed by the press as something akin to a [[Prime Minister]].<ref>{{cite web|last=James|first=Barry|title=Prodi to Have Wide, New Powers as Head of the European Commission|publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=[[1999-04-16]]|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1999/04/16/eu.2.t_0.php|accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Rossant|first=John|title=Commentary: Romano Prodi: Europe's First Prime Minister?

In 2004 [[Jos<U+00E9> Manuel Barroso]] became President, however the Parliament once again asserted itself in objecting to the proposed membership of the [[Barroso Commission]]. Due to the opposition Barroso was forced to reshuffle his team before taking office.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tobais|first=Troll|title =<U+201C>We have to democratise procedures<U+201D>|date=[[2004-11-02]]|publisher=Caf<U+00E9> Babel|url=http://www.cafebabel.com/en/article.asp?T=T&Id=2620|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref> The Barroso Commission was also the first full Commission since the enlargement in 2004 to 25 members and hence the number of Commissioners at the end of the Prodi Commission had reached 30. As a result of the increase in states, the Amsterdam Treaty triggered a reduction in Commissioners to one Commissioner per state, rather than two for the larger states.<ref name="ENA composition"/>

==Powers and functions==
[[Image:Jos<U+00E9> Manuel Barroso MEDEF 2.jpg|thumb|Incumbent [[Jos<U+00E9> Manuel Barroso|President Barroso]]]]

The Commission was set up from the start to act as an independent supranational authority separate from governments; it has been described as "the only body paid to think European".<ref name="Day">{{cite web|title = Interview with European Commission Secretary-General Catherine Day|publisher=EurActiv|date=[[2006-09-25]]|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/future-eu/interview-european-commission-secretary-general-catherine-day/article-158149 |accessdate = 2007-06-17}}</ref> The members are proposed by their member state governments, one from each, however they are bound to act independently{{ndash}} neutral from other influences such as those governments which appointed them. This is in contrast to the [[Council of the European Union|Council]], which represents governments, and the [[European Parliament|Parliament]], which represents [[EU citizen|citizens]] and the Economic and Social Committee, which the treaty says represents 'organised civil society'.<ref name="Europa Institutions"/> 

===Executive power===
Executive power of the Union is held by the Council: it confers on the Commission such powers for it to exercise. However, the Council may withdraw these powers, exercise them directly, or impose conditions on their use.<ref>{{cite web|title=Executive body|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=3312 |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Implementing powers of the Council of the European Union|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=5625 |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> Powers are outlined in Articles 211<U+2013>219 of the EC treaty<ref>{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = Consolidated version of the Treaty Establishing the European Community|url=http://europa.eu/eur-lex/en/treaties/dat/C_2002325EN.003301.html|accessdate = 2007-06-17}}</ref> and are more restricted than most national executives, in part due to  the Commission's lack of power over areas like [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|foreign policy]]{{ndash}} that power is held by the [[European Council]], which some analyses have described as another executive.<ref name="dragoman"/>

Considering that under the [[Lisbon Treaty]] the European Council would become a formal institution with the power of appointing the Commission, it could be said that the two bodies hold the executive power of the Union (the European Council also holds individual national executive powers). However, it is the Commission which currently holds executive powers over the [[European Community]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bermann|first=George|title=Executive Power in the New European Constitution|year=2004|url=http://www.jeanmonnetprogram.org/papers/04/040501-13.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[New York University]]|accessdate = 2006-06-18}}</ref><ref name="dragoman">{{cite web|last=Stark|first=Christine|publisher = Dragoman|title = Evolution of the European Council: The implications of a permanent seat|date=[[2002-09-04]]|url=http://www.dragoman.org/ec/belfast-2002.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-07-10}}</ref> The [[government]]al powers of the Commission have been such that some such as former [[Belgian Prime Minister]] [[Guy Verhofstadt]] have suggested changing its name to the "European Government", calling the present name of commission: ''"ridiculous"''.<ref>{{cite book| last = Verhofstadt| first =Guy| title =The United States of Europe| publisher =Federal Trust| year =2006| location =[[London]]| pages =69| isbn =1-903403-86-3}}</ref>

===Legislative initiative===
The Commission differs from the other institutions in that it alone has [[legislative initiative]] in the 'pillars' of the European Union, meaning only the Commission can make formal proposals for legislation{{ndash}} [[bill (proposed law)|bills]] cannot formally originate in the legislative branch. It shares this right with the Council over the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|CFSP pillar]], but has no right over [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters]]. In the Community however, Council and Parliament are able to request legislation; in most cases the Commission initiates the basis of these proposals, this monopoly is designed to ensure coordinated and coherent drafting of [[Law of the European Union|Union law]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = Glossary: Right of initiative|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/initiative_right_en.htm |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|title = The Commission's right of initiative|url=http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/02/cv00/00230en2.pdf |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> This monopoly has been challenged by some who claim the Parliament should also have the right, with most national parliaments holding the right in some respects.<ref>{{cite web|last = Murray|first=Alasdair|title = Reform not or languish later|publisher=[[Centre for European Reform]]|date=[[2002-09-30]]|url=http://www.cer.org.uk/articles/murray_parl_0902.html |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> Under the Lisbon Treaty, EU citizens would also be able to request the Commission to legislate in an area via a petition carrying one million signatures, but it would not be binding.<ref>{{cite web|last = Wallis |first = Diana| authorlink =Diana Wallis|last2=Picard|first2=Severine|title = The Citizens' Right of Initiative in the European Constitution: A Second Chance for Democracy|url=http://www.eumap.org/journal/features/2005/demodef/wallis |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref>

The Commission's powers in proposing law have usually centred on economic regulation. It has put forward a large number of regulations based on a "[[precautionary principle]]". This means that pre-emptive regulation takes place if there is a credible hazard to the environment or human health: for example on tackling [[climate change]] and restricting [[genetically modified organisms]]. This is opposed to weighting regulations for their effect on the effect on the economy. Thus, the Commission have produced stricter regulations than other countries. Due to the size of the European market this has made the Commission the ''de facto'' regulator of the global market.<ref>{{cite web|publisher = [[The Economist]]|date=[[2007-09-20]]|title = Brussels rules OK|url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9832900|accessdate = 2007-10-22}}</ref>

Recently the Commission has moved into creating [[Law of the European Union#Criminal law|European criminal law]]. In 2006, a [[2006 C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire toxic waste spill|toxic waste spill off the coast of C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire]], from a European ship, prompted the Commission to look into legislation against toxic waste. Some EU states at that time did not even have a crime against shipping toxic waste leading to the Commissioners [[Franco Frattini]] and [[Stavros Dimas]] to put forward the idea of "ecological crimes". Their right to propose criminal law was challenged in the [[European Court of Justice]] but upheld. As of 2007, the only other criminal law proposals which have been brought forward are on the [[Proposed directive on criminal measures aimed at ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights|intellectual property rights directive]],<ref name="E!Sharp0507 Legal">{{cite news|last=Charter|first=David|coauthors=|title=A new legal environment|work=E!Sharp|pages=23&ndash;5|publisher=People Power Process|year=2007|url=|accessdate=}}.</ref> and on an amendment to the 2002 counter-terrorism framework decision, outlawing terrorism<U+2011>related incitement, recruitment (especially via the internet) and training.<ref>{{cite web|publisher = European Commission|date=[[2007-11-06]]|title = Counter<U+2011>terrorism <U+2013> EU steps up a gear|url=http://ec.europa.eu/news/justice/071106_1_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-11-21}}</ref>

===Enforcement===
Once legislation is passed by the Council and Parliament, it is the Commission's responsibility to ensure it is implemented. It does this through the member states or through its [[Agencies of the European Union|agencies]]. In adopting the necessary technical measures, the Commission is assisted by committees made up of representatives of member states (a process known in jargon as "[[comitology]]").<ref>{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = Glossary: Comitology|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/comitology_en.htm |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> Furthermore, the Commission is responsible for the implementation of the [[EU budget]]; ensuring, along with the [[Court of Auditors]], that EU funds are correctly spent.

In particular the Commission has a duty to ensure the treaties and law are upheld, potentially by taking member states or other institutions to the [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]] in a dispute. In this role it is known informally as the "guardian of the treaties".<ref name = "oispex">{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = The European Commission|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> Finally, the Commission provides some [[foreign relations of the European Union|external representation]] for the Union, alongside the member states and the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]], representing the Union in bodies such as the [[World Trade Organisation]]. It is also usual for the President to attend meetings of the [[G8]].<ref name = "oispex"/>

==College==
The Commission is composed of a college of "[[European Commissioner|Commissioners]]", 27 members in all, including the President and vice-presidents. Even though each member is appointed by a national government, one per state, they do not represent their state in the Commission<ref name="bbc examine">{{cite web|last =Lungescu|first=Oana|publisher=[[BBC News]]|title =Examining the EU executive|date=[[2004-07-23]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/letter_from_america/3921303.stm|accessdate = 2007-09-18}}</ref> (however in practice they do occasionally press for their national interest<ref>{{cite book| last = Eppink | first = Derk-Jan | authorlink = Derk Jan Eppink |  coauthors = Ian Connerty (translator) | title = Life of a European Mandarin: Inside the Commission | publisher = Lannoo | edition = 1st edition  | location = Tielt, Belgium | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-9020970227 | pages = p.119 }}</ref>). Once proposed, the President delegates portfolios between each of the members. The power of a Commissioner largely depends upon their portfolio, and can vary over time. For example, the [[European Commissioner for Education, Training, Culture and Youth|Education Commissioner]] has been growing in importance, in line with the rise in the importance of education and culture in European policy-making <ref>See paragraphs 7, 8 & 13 of the Presidency conclusions of the European Council on 13/14 March 2008, http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/ec/99410.pdf</ref>. Another example is the [[European Commissioner for Competition|Competition Commissioner]], who holds a highly-visible position with global reach.<ref name="bbc examine"/> Before the Commission can assume office, the college as a whole must be approved by the Parliament.<ref name="Europa Institutions"/> Commissioners are supported by their [[Cabinet (European Commission)|personal cabinet]] who give them political guidance, while the [[European Civil Service|Civil Service]] (the DGs, see below) deal with technical preparation.<ref>{{cite book| last = Eppink | first = Derk-Jan | authorlink = Derk Jan Eppink |  coauthors = Ian Connerty (translator) | title = Life of a European Mandarin: Inside the Commission | publisher = Lannoo | edition = 1st edition  | location = Tielt, Belgium | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-9020970227 | pages = p.109 }}</ref>

===Appointment===
[[Image:European Commission Room (Open Day) 1.jpg|right|thumb|Floor 13 of the Berlaymont, Commission's meeting room]]
The [[President of the European Commission|President of the Commission]] is first nominated by the European Council; that nominee is then officially elected by the [[European Parliament]]. The candidate selected by the Council has often been a leading national politician but this is not a requirement. In 2004, the proposed Constitution had included a provision that the choice of President must take into account the latest [[Elections in the European Union|Parliamentary elections]]. That provision was not in force in the nomination in 2004, but the centre-right parties of the EU pressured for a candidate from their own ranks. In the end, a right-wing candidate was chosen: [[Jos<U+00E9> Manuel Barroso]] of the [[European People's Party]].<ref>{{cite web|last =|first=|title =Choosing a New EU Commission President| publisher =[[Deutsche Welle]]]|date=[[2004-06-16]]|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,1237192,00.html|accessdate = 2007-08-27}}</ref>

There are further criteria influencing the choice of the Council, these include: which area of Europe the candidate comes from, favoured as Southern Europe in 2004; the candidate's political influence, credible yet not overpowering members; language, proficiency in [[French language|French]] considered necessary by France; and degree of integration, their state being a member of both the [[eurozone]] and the [[Schengen Agreement]].<ref>{{cite web|last =Fuller|first=Thomas|title =Portuguese premier wants to unite bloc: Barroso nominated to head EU executive| publisher =[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=[[2004-06-30]]|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/06/30/eu_ed3__5.php|accessdate = 2007-07-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last =Stuart|first=Paul|title =Portugal<U+2019>s Prime Minister Barroso nominated as European Commission president| publisher =World Socialist Web Site|date=[[2004-07-21]]|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2004/jul2004/port-j21.shtml|accessdate = 2007-07-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last =|first=|title =Jos<U+00E9> Manuel Dur<U+00E3>o Barroso: The New Commission President| publisher =Grayling|year=2004|url=http://www.graylingbrussels.com/Vote4CommissionPresident/index.php?page=barossoprofile|accessdate = 2007-07-01}}</ref>

In 2004, this system produced a number of candidates<ref>{{cite web|last =|first=|title =Commission president: Key candidates| publisher =[[BBC News]]|date=[[2004-06-27]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3816901.stm|accessdate = 2007-07-01}}</ref> and was thus criticised by some MEPs: following the drawn-out selection, the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats|ALDE group]] leader [[Graham Watson]] described the procedure as a "[[Justus Lipsius building|Justus Lipsius]] carpet market" producing only the "lowest common denominator"; while [[European Greens<U+2013>European Free Alliance|Green-EFA]] co-leader [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]] asked Barroso after his first speech "If you are the best candidate, why were you not the first?"<ref>{{cite web|last =Cohn-Bendit|first=Daniel|title = Nomination of Commission President handled "in a most unsatisfactory way"| publisher =[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]] |year=2004|url=http://www.grahamwatsonmep.org/news/000025.html|accessdate = 2007-07-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last =Watson|first=Graham|title =Statement by the President-designate of the Commission| publisher =Graham Watson MEP website|date=[[2004-07-21]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+CRE+20040721+ITEM-006+DOC+XML+V0//EN&language=EN|accessdate = 2007-07-01}}</ref>

Following their appointment, the President appoints a number of [[Vice-President of the European Commission|Vice-Presidents]] among the [[European Commissioner|Commissioners]]. At present there are five, with [[Margot Wallstr<U+00F6>m]] as the current "First" Vice President. For the most part, the position grants little extra power to Vice-Presidents, except the first Vice-President who stands in for the President when he is away.<ref name="bbc examine"/>

===Political styles===
The present Commission, the [[Barroso Commission]], took office in late 2004 after being delayed by objections from the Parliament which forced a reshuffle. In 2007 the Commission increased from 25 to 27 members with the accession of [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] who each appointed their own Commissioners. With the increasing size of the Commission, President Barroso has adopted a more Presidential style of control over the college, which has earned him some criticism.<ref>{{cite web|last = Beunderman |first=Mark|publisher=EU Observer|title = EU commission sees civil servants' power grow|date=[[2007-02-22]]|url=http://euobserver.com/843/23553 |accessdate = 2007-02-27}}</ref>

However, despite Barroso being a more presidential and high profile figure than his predecessors, the Commission has begun to lose ground to the larger member states as countries such as France, the UK and Germany seek to sideline its role. This might have increased with the creation of the [[President of the European Council]] under the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], which has not been ratified.<ref>{{cite web|last = Iey Berry |first=Peter Sain |publisher=EU Observer|title = [Comment] Power is slipping from the commission to the council |date=[[2008-01-18]]|url=http://euobserver.com/9/25484 |accessdate = 2008-01-18}}</ref> Furthermore, there has also been a greater degree of [[European Commissioner#Politicisation|politicisation within the Commission]], this being welcomed by Commissioner Wallstr<U+00F6>m as necessary for citizens' engagement in European affairs.<ref>{{cite web|last = Mahony |first=Honor|publisher=EU Observer|title = Brussels struggles with communication policy|date=[[2007-05-07]]|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24016 |accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref>

==Organisation==
{{see|European Civil Service}}
The Commission is primarily based in Brussels, with the President's office and the Commission's meeting room based on the 13th floor of  the [[Berlaymont]] building. The Commission also operates out of [[Brussels and the European Union|numerous other buildings in Brussels]] and [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]].<ref name="Europa Institutions"/><ref>{{cite web|last =Castle|first=Stephen|publisher=[[The Independent]]|title=After 13 years of hold-ups and incompetence, the EU's 'Berlaymonster' rises like a phoenix|date=[[2004-08-05]]|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article50224.ece|accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> When the Parliament is meeting in Strasbourg, the Commissioners also meet there in the [[Seat of the European Parliament in Strasbourg#Winston Churchill and Salvador de Madariaga|Winston Churchill building]] to attend the Parliament's debates.<ref>{{cite book| last = Eppink | first = Derk-Jan | authorlink = Derk Jan Eppink |  coauthors = Ian Connerty (translator) | title = Life of a European Mandarin: Inside the Commission | publisher = Lannoo | edition = 1st edition  | location = Tielt, Belgium | year = 2007 | pages = p.213 | isbn = 978-9020970227 }}</ref> The Commission is divided into departments known as [[Directorate-General|Directorates-General]] (DGs) that can be likened to departments or [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]]. Each covers a specific policy area or service such as External relations or Translation and is headed by Director-General who is responsible to a Commissioner. A Commissioner's portfolio can be supported by numerous DGs, they prepare proposals for them and if approved by a majority of Commissioners it goes forward to Parliament and Council for consideration.<ref>{{cite web|title = Eurojargon|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/abc/eurojargon/index_en.htm|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref><ref name="Europa Institutions"/> There has been criticism from a number of people that the highly fragmented DG structure wastes a considerable about of time in [[turf war]]s as the different departments and Commissioners compete with each other. Furthermore the DGs can exercise considerable control over a Commissioner with the Commissioner having little time to learn to assert control over their staff.<ref name="LEM">{{cite web|last=Amies|first=Nick|title = Former EU Mandarin Spills the Beans on Commission Intrigue|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=[[2007-09-21]]|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2790009,00.html|accessdate=2007-10-17}}</ref><ref name="Press Releases"/>

According to figures published by the Commission, 23,043 persons were employed by the Commission as officials and temporary agents in April 2007. In addition to these, 9019 "external staff" (e.g. Contractual agents, detached national experts, young experts etc) were employed. The single largest DG is the [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Translation]], with a 2186-strong staff, while the largest group by nationality is [[Belgium|Belgian]] (21.4%), probably due to a majority (16,626) of staff being based in the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Civil Service: Staff figures|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/civil_service/about/figures/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref> The [[European Civil Service|Commission's civil service]] is headed by a [[Secretary-General of the European Commission|Secretary General]], currently [[Catherine Day]].<ref name="Day"/>

===Press===
[[Image:Berlaymont Press Room.jpg|thumb|Press Room in the Berlaymont]]

Communication with the press is handled by the [[Directorate-General Communication (European Commission)|Directorate-General Communication]]. The Commission's chief [[spokesperson]] is Johannes Laitenberger who takes the midday [[Mass media|press]] briefings, commonly known as the "Midday Presser". It takes place every weekday in the Commission's press room at the Berlaymont where journalists may ask questions of Commission officials on any topic and legitimately expect to get an "on the record" answer for live TV. Such a situation is unique in the world.<ref>{{cite web|last =Lynam|first=Joe|title=The peculiar world of the European Union|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2007-04-01]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6496813.stm|accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> There is a greater number of press corps in Brussels than [[Washington D.C.]]; media outlets in every Union member-state have a Brussels [[correspondent]].<ref>{{cite journal|last = Parker|first = John|title = A tale of two cities|journal = E!Sharp magazine|pages = 42<U+2013>44|date = January &ndash; February 2007|publisher = Encompass Publications }}</ref>

It has been noted by one researcher that the press releases issued by the Commission are uniquely political. A release often goes through several stages of drafting which emphasises the role of the Commission and is used "for justifying the EU and the commission" increasing their length and complexity. Where there are multiple departments involved a press release can also be a source of competition between areas of the Commission and Commissioner's themselves. This also leads to an unusually high number of press releases, 1907 for 2006, and is seen as a unique product of the EU's political set-up.<ref name="Press Releases">{{cite web|last =Mahony|first=Honor|title=EU carefully manages PR through 1000s of press releases|publisher=EU Observer|date=[[2007-10-17]]|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24971|accessdate=2007-10-17}}</ref>

==Legitimacy==
It is argued by some that the method of appointment for the Commission increases the [[democratic deficit in the European Union]].<ref>{{cite web|last =Mulvey|first=Stephan|title = The EU's democratic challenge| publisher =[[BBC News]]|date=[[2003-11-21]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3224666.stm |accessdate = 2007-08-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last =|first=|title = Democratic deficit| publisher =[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/democratic_deficit_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-08-27}}</ref> While the Commission is the executive branch, the candidates are chosen primarily by the 27 national governments, meaning it is hard for the Commission to be thrown out directly by the voters. The legitimacy of the Commission is mainly drawn from the vote of approval that is required from the Parliament along with Parliament's power to sack the body, however there has been less than 50% turnout in the Parliament's elections [[European Parliament election, 1999|since 1999]]. While that figure may be higher than that of some national elections, including those of the [[United States Congress]], the fact that there are no elections for the position Commission President, unlike in the United States, makes the post less legitimate in the eyes of the public.<ref>{{cite web|last =Mulvey|first=Stephen|title = The EU's democratic challenge| publisher =[[BBC News]]|date=[[2003-11-21]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3224666.stm |accessdate = 2007-06-17}}</ref> A further problem is the lack of a coherent electorate, even though democratic structures and methods are developing there is not such a mirror in creating a European [[civil society]].<ref>{{cite web|last =Lamming|first=Richard|title = The democratic credentials of the new European Union: does the Constitution increase the EU's democratic legitimacy?| publisher =[[Federal Union]]|date=[[2004-09-10]]|url=http://www.federalunion.org.uk/europe/democraticcredentials.shtml |accessdate = 2007-06-17}}</ref> The new [[Treaty of Lisbon]] might have gone some way to resolving the deficit in creating greater democratic controls on the Commission, including enshrining the procedure of linking elections to the selection of the Commission president, but at present it cannot be implemented because of the [[Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland Bill, 2008|Irish No-Vote]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = Glossary: Democratic deficit|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/democratic_deficit_en.htm |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> Under the plans of Vice President Wallstr<U+00F6>m, [[European political parties]] would gain greater prominence and could lead to the Commission President being elected via the [[Elections in the European Union|Parliament's elections]].<ref>{{cite web|last = Mahony |first=Honor|title = European politics to get more political| publisher =EU Observer|date=[[2007-06-27]]|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24370 |accessdate = 2007-06-27}}</ref>

The alternative viewpoint on the Commission states that the policy areas in which it has power to initiate legislation are ill suited to an institution accountable to electoral pressures. In this respect the Commission has been compared with institutions such as independent [[Central Bank]]s which deal with technical areas of policy that are of little electoral salience. This argument is by no means universally accepted, because many areas of EU policy affect the lives and livelihoods of ordinary people throughout member nations of the EU and it is a principle of [[Democracy|democratic government]] that citizens of voting age have the right to express an opinion on government policies through the [[Election|ballot box]]. In addition some defenders of the Commission point out that legislation must be approved by the Council in all areas (the ministers of member states) and the European Parliament in some areas before it can be adopted, thus the amount of legislation which is adopted in any one country without the approval of its government is limited.<ref>{{cite journal |quotes= |last=Majone |first=Giandomenico |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |month= |title=Perils of Parliamentarization |journal=Governance |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=375 |id= |url= |accessdate= }}</ref>

==Research funded by the European Commission==
The European Commission funds or sponsors a number of researches in the European Union, via a variety of research programmes and instruments <ref>{{cite web|title = CORDIS: Community Research & Development Information Service| url=http://cordis.europa.eu/}}</ref>.
For instance, the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development ([[Seventh Framework Programme|FP7]]) is the European Union<U+00B4>s chief instrument for funding research over the period 2007 to 2013.

==Future of the Commission==
The proposed [[Lisbon Treaty]], which currently may not be ratified by its 2009 deadline due to a [[Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland Bill, 2008|referendum]] in which the people of Ireland voted 'No' to the Treaty, largely retains the reforms outlined in the rejected [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|Constitutional Treaty]].<ref>{{cite web|last = Council of the European Union|title = Brussels European Council 21/22 June 2007: Presidency Conclusions |date=[[2007-06-20]]|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/ec/94932.pdf|accessdate = 2007-06-22 }}</ref><ref name="refdotie"> Results of the Irish Referendum on The Lisbon Treaty[http://www.referendum.ie/home/]</ref> The constitution's reforms proposed a number of changes, notably the number of Commissioners would be reduced; from 2014 only two out of three member-states would have the right to representation. The representation would be rotated equally between all states and  no state would have more than one in any single Commission. The Commission would also include the new [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]]<ref>Had the draft Constitution been passed, the High Representative would have been called the "Union Foreign Minister"{{ndash}} the first time a member of the Commission held the common national title of "Minister".</ref> , as one of the Vice Presidents, replacing the [[European Commissioner for External Relations|External Relations Commissioner]]. In the appointment of the Commission, the most recent European elections would have to be taken into account. It is thought this would create a stronger link between the elections and the Commission, however the President would still be proposed by the Council. Although when the Parliament votes on the Commission, the treaty changes the term "approve" to "elect" in referring to the vote: it is unknown yet if this will produce practical change.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Union's institutions: Commission|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/commission_en.htm|accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref>
