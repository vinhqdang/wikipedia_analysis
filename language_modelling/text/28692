The '''Tang Dynasty''' ({{zh-cp|c=[[wikt:<U+5510><U+671D>|<U+5510><U+671D>]]|p=T<U+00E1>ng Ch<U+00E1>o}}; [[Middle Chinese]]: dh<U+0251>ng)<ref name="Karlgren">Karlgren, ''Grammata serica recensa'', 1996.</ref> (June 18, 618 &ndash; June 4, 907) was an [[Dynasties in Chinese history|imperial dynasty of China]] preceded by the [[Sui Dynasty]] and followed by the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period]]. It was founded by the [[Li (<U+674E>)]] family, who seized power during the decline and collapse of the Sui Empire. The dynasty was interrupted briefly by the Second Zhou Dynasty (October 16, 690 &ndash; March 3, 705) when Empress [[Wu Zetian]] seized the throne, becoming the first and only Chinese [[Queen regnant|empress regnant]], ruling in her own right.

The Tang Dynasty, with its capital at [[Chang'an]] (present-day [[Xi'an]]), the most populous city in the world at the time, is regarded by historians as a high point in [[China|Chinese]] civilization<U+2014>equal to or surpassing that of the earlier [[Han Dynasty]]<U+2014>as well as a golden age of cosmopolitan culture. Its territory, acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers, was greater than that of the Han period, and rivaled that of the later [[Yuan Dynasty]] and [[Qing Dynasty]]. The enormous [[Grand Canal of China]], built during the previous Sui Dynasty, facilitated the rise of new urban settlements along its route as well as increased trade between mainland Chinese markets. The canal is to this day the longest in the world. In two censuses of the 7th and 8th centuries, the Tang records stated that the  population (by number of registered households) was about 50 million people.<ref name="ebrey 2006 91"/><ref name="ebrey cambridge 111">Ebrey (1999), 111.</ref><ref name="ebrey cambridge 141">Ebrey (1999), 141.</ref>{{Cref|a}} However, even when the central government was breaking down and unable to compile an accurate census of the population in the 9th century, it is estimated that the population in that century had grown to the size of about 80 million people.<ref>Du, p. 37</ref><ref name="fairbank 106">Fairbank, 106.</ref> With its large population base, the dynasty was able to raise professional and conscripted armies of hundreds of thousands of troops to contend with nomadic powers in dominating [[Inner Asia]] and the lucrative trade routes along the [[Silk Road]]. [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|Various kingdoms and states paid tribute]] to the Tang court, while the Tang also conquered or subdued several regions which it indirectly controlled through [[Ancient China's Protectorate System|a protectorate system]]. Besides political hegemony, the Tang also exerted a powerful cultural influence over neighboring states such as those in [[Korea]] and [[Japan]].

In [[History of China|Chinese history]], the Tang Dynasty was largely a period of progress and stability, except during the [[An Shi Rebellion]] and the decline of central authority in the latter half of the dynasty. Like the previous Sui Dynasty, the Tang Dynasty maintained a [[civil service]] system by [[Scholar-bureaucrats|drafting officials]] through [[Imperial examinations|standardized examinations]] and recommendations to office. This civil order was undermined by the rise of regional military governors known as [[jiedushi]] during the 9th century. [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]] flourished and further matured during the Tang era; it is considered the greatest age for [[Chinese poetry]].<ref name="Yu 71 87">Yu, 73<U+2013>87.</ref> Two of China's most famous historical poets, [[Du Fu]] and [[Li Bai]], belonged to this age, as well as the poets [[Meng Haoran]], [[Du Mu]], and [[Bai Juyi]]. Many famous visual artists lived during this era, such as the renowned painters [[Han Gan]], [[Zhang Xuan]], and [[Zhou Fang (Tang Dynasty)|Zhou Fang]]. There was a rich variety of [[Chinese historiography|historical literature]] compiled by scholars, as well as encyclopedias and books on geography. There were many notable innovations during the Tang, including the development of [[woodblock printing]], the [[escapement]] mechanism in [[horology]], the government compilations of ''[[materia medica]]s'', improvements in [[cartography]] and the application of hydraulics to power [[air conditioning]] [[Fan (mechanical)|fans]]. The religious and philosophical ideology of [[Buddhism]] became a major aspect of Chinese culture, with [[Chinese Buddhism|native Chinese sects]] becoming the most prominent. However, Buddhism would eventually be persecuted by the state and would decline in influence. Although the dynasty and central government were in decline by the 9th century, art and culture continued to flourish. The weakened [[central government]] largely withdrew from managing the [[Economic history of China|economy]], but the country's mercantile affairs stayed intact and commercial trade continued to thrive regardless.

Li Yuan ruled until 626 before being forcefully deposed by his son Li Shimin, Prince of Qin. Li Shimin had commanded troops since the age of 18, had prowess with a [[Bow (weapon)|bow]], [[Chinese swords|sword]], [[lance]], and was known for his effective [[cavalry]] charges.<ref name="ebrey 2006 91"/><ref name="graff 2000 80">Graff (2000), 80.</ref> Fighting a numerically superior army, he defeated [[Dou Jiande]] (573&ndash;621) at [[Luoyang]] in the [[Battle of Hulao]] on May 28, 621.<ref name="adshead 40 42">Adshead, 40&ndash;42.</ref><ref>Graff (2000), 78, 82, 85&ndash;86, & 95.</ref> In a violent elimination of royal family due to fear of assassination, Li Shimin ambushed and killed two of his brothers, [[Li Yuanji]] (b. 603) and [[Crown Prince]] [[Li Jiancheng]] (b. 589) in the [[Incident at Xuanwu Gate]] on July 2, 626.<ref name="adshead 42"/> Shortly thereafter, his father abdicated in his favor and Li Shimin ascended the throne.

===Administration and politics===

[[Image:Sui Yangdi Tang.jpg|thumb|left|[[Portrait painting]] of [[Emperor Yang of Sui]], commissioned in 643 by [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Taizong]], painted by [[Yan Liben]] (600&ndash;673)]]
====Initial reforms====
Taizong set out to solve internal problems within the government which had constantly plagued past dynasties. Building upon the Sui [[legal code]], he issued [[Tang Code|a new legal code]] that subsequent Chinese dynasties would model theirs upon, as well as neighboring polities in [[Vietnam]], [[Korea]], and [[Japan]].<ref name="ebrey 2006 91"/> The earliest law code to survive though was the one established in the year 653, which was divided into 500 articles specifying different crimes and penalties ranging from ten blows with a light stick, one hundred blows with a heavy rod, exile, penal servitude, or execution.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 111 112">Ebrey (1999), 111&ndash;112.</ref> The legal code clearly distinguished different levels of severity in meted punishments when different members of the social and political hierarchy committed the same crime.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 112">Ebrey (1999), 112.</ref> For example, the severity of punishment was different when a servant or nephew killed a master or an uncle than when a master or uncle killed a servant or nephew.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 112"/>  The Tang Code was largely retained by later codes such as the early [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368&ndash;1644) code of 1397,<ref>Andrew & Rapp, 25.</ref> yet there were several revisions in later times, such as [[Society of the Song Dynasty#Women: legality and lifestyles|improved property rights for women]] during the [[Song Dynasty]] (960&ndash;1279).<ref>Ebrey (1999), 158.</ref><ref>Bernhardt, 274<U+2013>275.</ref>

The Tang had three departments (<U+7701>, ''sh<U+011B>ng''), which were obliged to draft, review, and implement policies respectively. There were also six ministries (<U+90E8>, ''b<U+00F9>'') under the administrations that implemented policy, each of which was assigned different tasks. [[Three Departments and Six Ministries|These divisional state bureaus]] included the personnel administration, finance, rites, military, justice, and public works<U+2014>an administrative model which would last until the fall of the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644&ndash;1912).<ref name="fairbank 78">Fairbank, 78.</ref> Although the founders of the Tang related to the glory of the earlier [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC&ndash;220 AD), the basis for much of their administrative organization was very similar to the previous [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]].<ref name="ebrey 2006 91"/> The [[Northern Zhou]] (557&ndash;581) divisional militia ([[Fubing system|fubing]]) was continued by the Tang government, along with farmer-soldiers serving in rotation from the capital or frontier in order to receive appropriated farmland. The [[equal-field system]] of the [[Northern Wei|Northern Wei Dynasty]] (386&ndash;534) was also kept, although there were a few modifications.<ref name="ebrey 2006 91"/>

[[Image:Gilt silver eared cup.jpg|thumb|Tang era [[gilding|gilt]]-[[silver]] ear cup with flower motif]]
Although the central and local governments kept an enormous number of records about land property in order to assess taxes, it became common practice in the Tang for literate and affluent people to create their own private documents and signed [[contract]]s.<ref name="brook 59">Brook, 59.</ref> These had their own signature and that of a witness and scribe in order to prove in court (if necessary) that their claim to property was legitimate.<ref name="brook 59"/> The prototype of this actually existed since the ancient Han Dynasty, while contractual language became even more common and embedded into Chinese literary culture in later dynasties.<ref name="brook 59"/>

The center of the political power of the Tang was the capital city of [[Chang'an]] (modern [[Xi'an]]), where the emperor maintained his large palace quarters, and entertained political emissaries with music, sports, [[Acrobatics|acrobatic]] stunts, poetry, paintings, and [[Pear Garden|dramatic theater performances]]. The capital was also filled with incredible amounts of riches and resources to spare. When the Chinese [[prefecture|prefectural]] government officials traveled to the capital in the year 643 to give the annual report of the affairs in their districts, Emperor Taizong discovered that many had no proper quarters to rest in, and were renting rooms with merchants.<ref name="Benn 59">Benn, 59.</ref> Therefore, Emperor Taizong ordered the government agencies in charge of [[Township|municipal]] construction to build every visiting official his own private [[mansion]] in the capital.<ref name="Benn 59"/>

[[Image:Two foreign dignitaries, earthenware with sancai glaze, Tang Dynasty.JPG|thumb|left|Statuettes of two foreign dignitaries dressed in [[Han Chinese clothing|Hanfu]], made of ''[[sancai]]'' glazed earthenware, late 7th to early 8th century]]
====Imperial examinations==== 

Following the Sui Dynasty's example, the Tang abandoned the [[nine-rank system]] in favor of a large [[civil service]] system.<ref name="ebrey 2006 96"/> Students of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] studies were potential candidates for the [[imperial examination]]s, the graduates of which could be appointed as state bureaucrats in the local, provincial, and central government. There were two types of exams that were given, ''mingjing'' ('illuminating the classics examination') and ''jinshi'' ('presented scholar examination').<ref name="ebrey 2006 91 92">Ebrey (2006), 91&ndash;92.</ref>  The ''mingjing'' was based upon the [[Chinese classic texts|Confucian classics]], and tested the student's knowledge of a broad variety of texts.<ref name="ebrey 2006 91 92"/>  The ''jinshi'' tested a student's literary abilities in writing [[essay]]-style responses to questions on matters of governance and politics, as well as their skills in composing [[Chinese poetry|poetry]].<ref name="ebrey 2006 92">Ebrey (2006), 92.</ref>  Candidates were also judged on their skills of deportment, appearance, speech, and level of skill in [[calligraphy]], all of which were subjective criteria that allowed the already wealthy members of society to be chosen over ones of more modest means who were unable to be educated in [[rhetoric]] or fanciful writing skills.<ref name="ebrey 2006 97"/> Indeed there was a disproportionate number of civil officials coming from aristocratic as opposed to non-aristocratic families.<ref name="ebrey 2006 97"/> The exams were open to all male subjects whose fathers were not of the [[Four occupations|artisan or merchant classes]],<ref name="gascoigne gascoigne 95">Gascoigne & Gascoigne, 95.</ref> although having wealth or noble status was not a prerequisite in receiving a recommendation.<ref name="ebrey 2006 97">Ebrey (2006), 97.</ref> In order to promote widespread Confucian education, the Tang government established state-run schools and issued standard versions of the [[Five Classics]] with selected commentaries.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 112"/>

This competitive procedure was designed to draw the best talent into government. But perhaps an even greater consideration for the Tang rulers, aware that imperial dependence on powerful aristocratic families and [[warlord]]s would have destabilizing consequences, was to create a body of career officials having no autonomous territorial or functional [[Base (politics)|power base]]. The Tang law code ensured equal division of inherited property amongst legitimate heirs, allowing a bit of [[social mobility]] and preventing the families of powerful court officials in becoming [[landed nobility]] through [[primogeniture]].<ref name="fairbank 83">Fairbank, 83.</ref> As it turned out, these scholar-officials acquired status in their local communities and in family ties, while they also shared values that connected them to the imperial court. From Tang times until the end of the Qing Dynasty in 1912, [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar-officials]] functioned often as intermediaries between the [[grassroots]] level and the government. Yet the potential of a widespread examination system was not fully realized until the Song Dynasty, where the merit-driven scholar official largely shed his aristocratic habits and defined his social status through the examination system.<ref name = "ebrey 2006 159"/><ref name="fairbank 95">Fairbank, 95.</ref><ref name="adshead 54">Adshead, 54.</ref> As historian Patricia Ebrey states of the Song period scholar-officials:

{{quote|The examination system, used only on a small scale in Sui and Tang times, played a central role in the fashioning of this new elite. The early Song emperors, concerned above all to avoid domination of the government by military men, greatly expanded the civil service examination system and the government school system.|<ref name="ebrey cambridge 145 146">Ebrey (1999), 145&ndash;146.</ref>}}

Nevertheless, the Sui and Tang dynasties institutionalized and set the foundations for the civil service system and this new elite class of exam-drafted scholar-officials.

[[Image:Tang-xuanzong.jpg|thumb|left|[[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] wearing the robes and the hat of a scholar.]]
====Religion and politics====
From the outset, religion played a role in Tang politics. In his bid for power, Li Yuan had attracted a following by claiming descent from the [[Taoism|Daoist]] sage [[Laozi]] (fl. 6th century BC).<ref name="graff 2000 79">Graff (2000), 79.</ref> People bidding for office would have monks from Buddhist temples pray for them in public in return for cash donations or gifts if the person was to be selected. Before the persecution of Buddhism in the 9th century, Buddhism and Daoism were accepted side by side, and [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] (r. 712&ndash;756) invited monks and clerics of both religions to his court.<ref name="ebrey 2006 99"/> At the same time Xuanzong exalted the ancient Laozi by granting him grand titles, wrote commentary on the Daoist ''Laozi'', set up a school to prepare candidates for examinations on Daoist scriptures, and called upon the Indian monk [[Vajrabodhi]] (671&ndash;741) to perform [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] rites to avert a drought in the year 726.<ref name="ebrey 2006 99"/> In 742 Emperor Xuanzong personally held the incense burner during the ceremony of the [[Ceylonese]] monk [[Amoghavajra]] (705&ndash;774) reciting "mystical incantations to secure the victory of Tang forces."<ref name="ebrey 2006 99"/> In addition, if religion played a role in politics, then politics played a role in religion as well. In the year 714, Emperor Xuanzong forbade shops and vendors in the city of Chang'an to sell copied Buddhist sutras, instead giving the Buddhist [[clergy]] of the monasteries the sole right to distribute sutras to the [[laity]].<ref name="Benn, 57">Benn, 57.</ref> In the previous year of 713, Emperor Xuanzong had liquidated the highly lucrative [[Chang'an#Northwestern Chang'an|Inexhaustible Treasury]], which was run by a prominent Buddhist monastery in Chang'an. This monastery collected vast amounts of money, silk, and treasures through multitudes of anonymous people's repentances, leaving the donations on the monastery's premise.<ref name="Benn 61"/> Although the monastery was generous in donations, Emperor Xuanzong issued a decree abolishing their treasury on grounds that their [[History of banking in China|banking]] practices were fraudulent, collected their riches, and distributed the wealth to various other Buddhist monasteries, Daoist abbeys, and to repair statues, halls, and bridges in the city.<ref name="Benn 61">Benn, 61.</ref>

====Taxes and the census====
[[Image:Hangan02.jpg|thumb|250px|''A Man Herding Horses'', by [[Han Gan]] (706&ndash;783), a court artist under Xuanzong]]
The Tang Dynasty government attempted to create an accurate census of the size of their empire's population, mostly for effective taxation and matters of military conscription for each region. The early Tang government established both the grain tax and cloth tax at a relatively low rate for each household under the empire. This was meant to encourage households to enroll for taxation and not avoid the authorities, thus providing the government with the most accurate estimate possible.<ref name="ebrey 2006 91"/> In the census of 609, the population was tallied by efforts of the government at a size of 9 million households, or about 50 million people.<ref name="ebrey 2006 91"/> Again, the Tang census of the year 742 approximated the size China's population to about 50 million people.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 141"/> Patricia Ebrey writes that even if a rather significant number of people had avoided the registration process of the tax census, the population size during the Tang had not grown significantly since the earlier Han Dynasty (the census of the year 2 recording a population of 59 million people in China).<ref name="ebrey 2006 91"/> S.A.M. Adshead disagrees, estimating that there were about 75 million people by 750.<ref name="adshead 72">Adshead, 72.</ref> In the Tang census of the year 754, there were 1,859 cities, 321 [[Prefecture (China)|prefectures]], and 1,538 [[County (China)|counties]] throughout the empire.<ref name="benn 45">Benn, 45.</ref> Although there were many large and prominent cities during the Tang, the rural and agrarian areas comprised the majority of China's population at some 80 to 90 percent.<ref name="Benn 32">Benn, 32.</ref> There was also a dramatic migratory shift of the population from [[Northern and southern China|northern to southern China]], as the North held 75% of the overall population at the dynasty's inception, but by its end was reduced to 50%.<ref name="adshead 75">Adshead, 75.</ref>

Chinese population size would not dramatically increase until the Song Dynasty period, where the population doubled to 100 million people due to extensive rice cultivation in central and southern China, coupled with rural farmers holding more abundant yields of food that they could easily provide the growing market.<ref name="ebrey 2006 156">Ebrey (2006), 156.</ref>

===Military and foreign policy===
{{main|Military history of China|Naval history of China|Jimi system}}

====Protectorates and tributaries==== 
[[Image:Emperor Taizongs horses by Yan Liben.jpg|thumb|250px|A bas-[[relief]] of a soldier and horse with elaborate [[saddle]] and [[stirrup]]s, from the tomb of Emperor Taizong, c. 650]]
The 7th century and first half of the 8th century is generally considered the zenith era of the Tang Dynasty. Emperor Tang Xuanzong brought the [[All under heaven|Middle Kingdom]] to its golden age while the [[Silk Road]] thrived, with sway over [[Indochina]] in the south, and to the west Tang China was master of the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]] (modern-day [[Tajikistan]]) and protector of Kashmir bordering Persia.<ref name="Benn 4"/>

Some of the kingdoms paying tribute to the Tang Dynasty included [[Kashmir region|Kashmir]], [[Nepal]], [[Khotan]], [[Kucha]], [[Kashgar]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Champa]], and kingdoms located in [[Amu Darya]] and [[Syr Darya]] valley.<ref name="whitfield 47">Whitfield, 47.</ref><ref name="twitchett">Twitchett, 116&ndash;118.</ref> Turkic nomads addressed the Emperor of Tang China as ''[[Tian Kehan]]''.<ref name="twitchett 124"/> After the widespread G<U+00F6>kt<U+00FC>rk revolt of [[Shabol<U+00FC>e Khan]] (d. 658) was put down at [[Issyk Kul]] in 657 by [[Su Dingfang]] (591&ndash;667), Emperor Gaozong established several [[Ancient China's Protectorate System|protectorates]] governed by a Protectorate General or Grand Protectorate General, which extended the Chinese [[sphere of influence]] as far as [[Herat]] in Western Afghanistan.<ref name="twitchett 118 122">Twitchett, 118 & 122.</ref> Protectorate Generals were given a great deal of autonomy to handle local crises without waiting for central admission. After Xuanzong's reign, military governors (jiedushi) were given enormous power, including the ability to maintain their own armies, collect taxes, and pass their titles on hereditarily. It was commonly recognized as the beginning of the fall of Tang's central government.<ref name="ebrey 2006 100"/><ref name="wang 91"/>

====Soldiers and conscription====
By the year 737, Emperor Xuanzong discarded the policy of conscripting soldiers that were replaced every three years, replacing them with long-service soldiers who were more battle-hardened and efficient.<ref name="Benn 9">Benn, 9.</ref> It was more economically feasible as well, since training new recruits and sending them out to the frontier every three years drained the treasury.<ref name="Benn 9"/> Plus, by the late 7th century, the ''fubing'' troops began abandoning military service and the homes allotted to them in the equal-field system, because the supposed standard 100 ''[[Mu (unit of area)|mu]]'' of land for each family was in fact decreasing in size in places where population expanded and the wealthy bought up most of the land.<ref name="graff 2002 208">Graff (2002), 208.</ref>  Hard-pressed peasants and vagrants were then induced into military service with benefits of exemption from both taxation and corv<U+00E9>e labor service, as well as provisions for farmland and dwellings for dependents who accompanied soldiers on the frontier.<ref name="graff 2002 209">Graff (2002), 209.</ref> By the year 742 the total number of enlisted troops in the Tang armies had risen to about 500,000 men.<ref name="Benn 9"/>

The Sui and Tang carried out very successful military campaigns against the steppe nomads. Chinese foreign policy to the north and west now had to deal with [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] nomads, who were becoming the most dominant ethnic group in [[Central Asia]].<ref name="ebrey 2006 113">Ebrey (2006), 113.</ref><ref>Xue, 149<U+2013>152, 257<U+2013>264.</ref>  To handle and avoid any threats posed by the Turks, the Sui government repaired fortifications and received their trade and tribute missions.<ref name="ebrey 2006 92"/> They sent royal princesses off to marry Turkic clan leaders, a total of four of them in 597, 599, 614, and 617.

Civil war in China was almost totally diminished by 626, along with the defeat in 628 of the [[Ordos Desert|Ordos]] Chinese warlord [[Liang Shidu]]; after these internal conflicts, the Tang began an offensive against the Turks.<ref>Xue, p. 226<U+2013>227</ref> In the year 630, Tang armies captured areas of the Ordos Desert, modern-day [[Inner Mongolia]] province, and southern [[Mongolia]] from the Turks.<ref>Xue, p. 380<U+2013>386</ref><ref name="ebrey cambridge 111"/>  After this military victory, Emperor Taizong won the title of Great Khan amongst the various Turks in the region who pledged their allegiance to him and the Chinese empire (with several thousand Turks traveling into China to live at Chang'an).

While the Turks were settled in the Ordos region (former territory of the [[Xiongnu]]), the Tang government took on the military policy of dominating the central [[steppe]]. Like the earlier Han Dynasty, the Tang Dynasty (along with Turkic allies) conquered and subdued Central Asia during the 640s and 650s.<ref name="ebrey 2006 92"/> During Emperor Taizong's reign alone, large campaigns were launched against not only the [[G<U+00F6>kt<U+00FC>rk]]s, but also separate campaigns against the [[Emperor Taizong's campaign against Tuyuhun|Tuyuhun]], the [[Emperor Taizong's campaign against Tufan|Tufan]], the [[Emperor Taizong's campaign against Xiyu states|Xiyu states]], and the [[Emperor Taizong's campaign against Xueyantuo|Xueyantuo]].

The Tang Empire fought with the [[History of Tibet#The Tibetan empire|Tibetan Empire]] for control of areas in Inner and Central Asia, which was at times settled with [[marriage alliances]] such as the marrying of [[Princess Wencheng]] (d. 680) to [[Songts<U+00E4>n Gampo]] (d. 649).<ref name="whitfield 193">Whitfield, 193.</ref><ref name="sen 24">Sen, 24, 30&ndash;31.</ref> Around 650 AD, Tang forces captured [[Lhasa]], capital of [[Tibet]].<ref>Bell (2000), 28.</ref> There was a long string of conflicts with Tibet over territories in the [[Tarim Basin]] between 670&ndash;692 and in 763 the Tibetans even captured the capital of China, [[Chang'an]], for fifteen days during the [[An Shi Rebellion]].<ref name="beckwith 146">Beckwith, 146.</ref><ref name="stein 65">Stein, 65.</ref> In fact, it was during this rebellion that the Tang withdrew its western garrisons stationed in what is now [[Gansu]] and [[Qinghai]], which the Tibetans then occupied along with the territory of what is now [[Xinjiang]].<ref name="twitchett 109">Twitchett, 109.</ref> Hostilities between the Tang and Tibet continued until they signed a formal peace treaty in 821.<ref name="Benn 11">Benn, 11.</ref> The terms of this treaty, including the fixed borders between the two countries, are recorded in a bilingual inscription on a stone pillar outside the [[Jokhang]] temple in Lhasa.<ref name="richardson 106 143">Richardson, 106<U+2013>143.</ref>

Although the battle itself was not of the greatest significance militarily, this was a pivotal moment in history; it marks the spread of Chinese [[papermaking]] into regions west of China,<ref name="bai 242 243">Bai, 242<U+2013>243.</ref><ref name="eberhard 183">Eberhard, 183.</ref> ultimately reaching Europe by the 12th century.

====Korea and Japan====
{{main|Protectorate General to Pacify the East}}

In the east, the Chinese military campaigns were less successful than elsewhere. [[Goguryeo-Sui Wars|Like the emperors of the Sui Dynasty before him]], Taizong established a military campaign in 644 against the [[Korea]]n kingdom of [[Goguryeo]] in the [[Goguryeo-Tang Wars]]. Since the ancient Han and Jin dynasties once had a [[Four Commanderies of Han|commandery]] in ancient northern Korea, the Tang Chinese desired to conquer the region. Allying with the Korean [[Silla]] Kingdom, the Chinese fought against [[Baekje]] and their [[Yamato period|Yamato Japanese]] allies in the [[Battle of Baekgang]] in August of 663, a decisive Tang<U+2013>Silla victory. The Tang Dynasty navy had [[Naval history of China#Tang era|several different ship types]] at its disposal to engage in [[naval warfare]], these ships described by Li Quan in his ''Taipai Yinjing'' (Canon of the White and Gloomy Planet of War) of 759.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 685 687">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 685<U+2013>687.</ref> The Battle of Baekgang was actually a restoration movement by remnant forces of Baekje, since their kingdom was toppled in 660 by a joint Tang<U+2013>Silla invasion, led by notable Korean general [[Kim Yushin]] (595&ndash;673) and Chinese general Su Dingfang. In another joint invasion with Silla, the Tang army severely weakened the Goguryeo Kingdom in the north by taking out its outer forts in the year 645. With joint attacks by Silla and Tang armies under commander [[Li Shiji]] (594&ndash;669), the Kingdom of Goguryeo was destroyed by 668.<ref name="Benn 4">Benn, 4.</ref> [[Image:Mogao Cave 61, painting of Mount Wutai monasteries.jpg|250px|thumb|A 10th century mural painting in the [[Mogao Caves]] at [[Dunhuang]] showing monastic architecture from [[Mount Wutai]], Tang Dynasty; [[Japanese architecture]] of this period was influenced by Tang Chinese architecture]]Although they were formerly enemies, the Tang accepted officials and generals of Goguryeo into their administration and military, such as the brothers [[Yeon Namsaeng]] (634&ndash;679) and [[Yeon Namsan]] (639&ndash;701). From 668 to 676, the Tang Empire would control northern Korea. However, in 671 Silla began fighting the Tang forces there. At the same time the Tang faced threats on its western border when a large Chinese army was defeated by the Tibetans on the Dafei River in 670.<ref name="graff 2002 201">Graff (2002), 201.</ref> By 676, the Tang army was driven out of Korea by [[Unified Silla]].<ref name="kang 54">Kang, 54.</ref> Following a revolt of the Eastern Turks in 679, the Tang abandoned its Korean campaigns.<ref name="graff 2002 201"/>

Although the Tang had fought the Japanese, they still held cordial relations with Japan. There were numerous [[Imperial embassies to China]] from Japan, diplomatic missions that were not halted until 894 by [[Emperor Uda]] (r. 887&ndash;897), upon persuasion by [[Sugawara no Michizane]] (845&ndash;903).<ref name="kitagawa 222">Kitagawa, 222.</ref> The Japanese [[Emperor Temmu]] (r. 672&ndash;686) even established his conscripted army on that of the Chinese model, his state ceremonies on the Chinese model, and constructed his palace at [[Fujiwara-ky<U+014D>|Fujiwara]] on the [[Chinese architecture|Chinese model of architecture]].<ref name="ebrey 2006 144">Ebrey (2006), 144.</ref> Many Chinese Buddhist monks came to Japan to help further the spread of Buddhism as well.

===Trade and spread of culture===
Through use of the land trade along the [[Silk Road]] and maritime trade by sail at sea, the Tang were able to gain many new technologies, cultural practices, rare luxury, and contemporary items. From the Middle East, India, Persia, and Central Asia the Tang were able to acquire new ideas in fashion, new types of ceramics, and improved silver-smithing.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 118 119">Ebrey (1999), 118&ndash;119.</ref> The Chinese also gradually adopted the foreign concept of stools and chairs as seating, whereas the Chinese beforehand always sat on mats placed on the floor.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 119">Ebrey (1999), 119.</ref> To the Middle East, the Islamic world coveted and purchased in bulk Chinese goods such as [[silk]]s, [[lacquerware]]s, and [[porcelain]] wares.<ref name="ebrey 2006 112"/>  Songs, dances, and musical instruments from foreign regions became popular in China during the Tang Dynasty.<ref name="ebrey 2006 114">Ebrey (2006), 114.</ref><ref name="whitfield 255">Whitfield, 255.</ref> These musical instruments included [[oboe]]s, [[flute]]s, and small lacquered [[drum]]s from [[Kucha]]<!--Weren't some of the foreign instruments and musicians in Chang'an also from [[Sogdiana]]?--> in the [[Tarim Basin]], and [[percussion instrument]]s from India such as [[cymbal]]s.<ref name="ebrey 2006 114"/>  At the court there were nine musical ensembles (expanded from seven in the Sui Dynasty) representing music from throughout Asia.<ref name="benn 134">Benn, 134.</ref>

There was great contact and interest in India as a hub for Buddhist knowledge, with famous travelers such as [[Xuanzang]] (d. 664) visiting the South Asian subcontinent. After a 17-year long trip, Xuanzang managed to bring back valuable [[Sanskrit]] texts to be translated into [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. There was also a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]<U+2013>Chinese dictionary available for serious scholars and students, while Turkic folksongs gave inspiration to some Chinese poetry.<ref name="schafer 28">Schafer, 28.</ref><ref name="eberhard 182">Eberhard, 182.</ref> In the interior of China, trade was facilitated by the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] and the Tang government's rationalization of the greater canal system that reduced costs of transporting grain and other commodities.<ref name="Benn 7"/> The state also managed roughly 32,100 km (20,000 miles) of [[Postal administration|postal service]] routes by horse or boat.<ref name="adshead 90">Adshead, 90.</ref>

====Silk Road==== 
[[Image:Tang horse.jpg|thumb|250px|A Tang Dynasty tri-color [[Ceramic glaze|glazed]] figurine of a horse]]
The [[Silk Road]] was the most important pre-modern Eurasian [[trade route]]. During this period of the [[Pax Sinica]], the Silk Road reached its golden age, whereby [[Persian people|Persian]] and [[Sogdiana|Sogdian]] merchants benefited from the commerce between East and West. At the same time, the Chinese empire welcomed foreign cultures, making the Tang capital arguably the most cosmopolitan area in the world.

Although the Silk Road from China to the West was initially formulated during the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (141&ndash;87 BC), it was reopened by the Tang in 639 when [[Hou Junji]] (d. 643) conquered the West, and remained open for almost four decades. It was closed after the Tibetans captured it in 678, but in 699, during Empress Wu's period, the Silk Road reopened when the Tang reconquered the [[Four Garrisons of Anxi]] originally installed in 640,<ref name="twitchett 118">Twitchett, 118.</ref> once again connecting China directly to the West for land-based trade.<ref name="Eberhard, 179">Eberhard, 179.</ref> The Tang captured the vital route through the [[Gilgit|Gilgit Valley]] from Tibet in 722, lost it to the Tibetans in 737, and regained it under the command of the Goguryeo-Korean General Gao Xianzhi.<ref name="sen 30 32">Sen, 30&ndash;32.</ref> After the An Shi Rebellion ended in 763, the Tang Empire had once again lost control over many of its outer western lands, as the Tibetan Empire largely cut off China's direct access to the Silk Road.<ref name="Benn 11"/> An internal rebellion in 848 ousted the Tibetan rulers, while Tang China regained its western territories from Tibet in 851, which contained crucial grazing areas and pastures for raising horses that the Tang Dynasty desperately needed.<ref name="Benn 11"/><ref name="whitfield 57">Whitfield, 57 & 228.</ref>

Despite the many western travelers coming into China to live and trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks, recorded the strict border laws that the Chinese enforced.<ref name="ebrey 2006 112"/> As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were many Chinese government [[border checkpoint|checkpoints]] along the Silk Road that examined [[permit to travel|travel permits]] into the Tang Empire.<ref name="ebrey 2006 112"/> Furthermore, [[outlaw|banditry]] was a problem along the checkpoints and [[oasis]] towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions.<ref name="ebrey 2006 112"/>

====Seaports and maritime trade====
Chinese envoys had been sailing through the [[Indian Ocean]] to [[Kanchipuram|India]] since the 2nd century BC,<ref name="Sun 161 167">Sun, 161<U+2013>167.</ref><ref name="Chen 67 71">Chen, 67<U+2013>71.</ref> yet it was during the Tang Dynasty that a strong Chinese maritime presence could be found in the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Red Sea]], into [[Persia]], [[Mesopotamia]] (sailing up the [[Euphrates River]] in modern-day [[Iraq]]), [[Arabia]], [[Egypt]], [[Aksum]] ([[Ethiopia]]), and [[Somalia]] in East [[Africa]].<ref name="bowman 104 105">Bowman, 104<U+2013>105.</ref>  From the same [[Quraysh]] tribe of [[Muhammad]], [[Sa'd ibn Abi-Waqqas]] sailed from Ethiopia to China during the reign of [[Emperor Gaozu]]. He later traveled back to China with a copy of the [[Quran]], establishing [[Islam during the Tang Dynasty|China's first mosque]], the Mosque of Remembrance, during the reign of [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]]. To this day he is still buried in a [[Muslim]] cemetery at [[Guangzhou]].
[[Image:ForeignMerchant.jpg|thumb|upright|Figurine of a foreign merchant of the Tang Dynasty, 7th century]]

During the Tang Dynasty, thousands of foreigners came and lived in numerous Chinese cities for trade and commercial ties with China, including Persians, Arabs, [[Hindu]] Indians, [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]], [[Khmer people|Khmers]], [[Cham people|Chams]], [[History of the Jews in China|Jews]] and [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christians]] of the [[Near East]], and many others.<ref name="Benn 46"/><ref name="schafer 20">Schafer, 20.</ref>  In 748, the Buddhist monk Jian Zhen described [[Guangzhou]] as a bustling mercantile center where many large and impressive foreign ships came to dock.

The Chinese engaged in large-scale production for overseas export by at least the time of the Tang. This was proven by the discovery of a silt-preserved shipwrecked Arab [[dhow]] in the [[Gaspar Strait]] near [[Belitung]], which had 63,000 pieces of Tang gold, silver, and ceramics (including a [[Changsha]] bowl inscribed with a date: "16th day of the seventh month of the second year of the Baoli reign", or 826 AD, roughly confirmed by [[radiocarbon dating]] of [[star anise]] at the wreck).<ref name="bbc news">[[BBC News]].

Although she entered Emperor Gaozong's court as the lowly consort Wu Zhao, [[Wu Zetian]] would rise to the highest seat of power in 690, establishing the short-lived later Zhou Dynasty. Empress Wu's rise to power was achieved through cruel and calculating tactics. For example, she allegedly killed her own baby girl and blamed it on Gaozong's empress so that the empress would be demoted.<ref name="ebrey 2006 97"/>  Emperor Gaozong suffered a [[stroke]] in 655, and Wu began to make many of his court decisions for him, discussing affairs of state with his councilors that would take orders from her while she sat behind a screen.<ref name="ebrey 2006 97 98">Ebrey (2006), 97&ndash;98.</ref> When Empress Wu's eldest son and crown prince began to assert his authority and announce his support for issues that were opposed to Empress Wu's ideas, he suddenly died in 675.

There were many prominent women at court during and after Wu's reign, including [[Shangguan Wan'er]] (664&ndash;710), a female poet, writer, and trusted official in charge of Wu's private office.<ref name="adshead 46">Adshead, 46.</ref> In 706 the wife of Emperor Zhongzong of Tang, [[Empress Wei (Zhongzong)|Empress Wei]] (d. 710), convinced her husband to staff government offices with his sister and her daughters, and in 709 requested that he grant women the right to bequeath hereditary privileges to their sons (which before was a male right only).<ref name="Benn 6"/>  Empress Wei eventually poisoned Zhongzong, whereupon she placed his fifteen year old son upon the throne in 710.<ref name="ebrey 2006 99"/>  Two weeks later, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Li Longji]] (the later Emperor Xuanzong) entered the palace with a few followers and slew Empress Wei and her faction.<ref name="ebrey 2006 99"/> He then installed his father [[Emperor Ruizong of Tang|Emperor Ruizong]] (r. 710&ndash;712) on the throne.<ref name="ebrey 2006 99"/>  Just as Emperor Zhongzong was dominated by Empress Wei, so too was Ruizong dominated by [[Princess Taiping]].<ref name="adshead 47">Adshead, 47.</ref> This was finally ended when Princess Taiping's coup failed in 712 (she later hanged herself in 713) and Emperor Ruizong abdicated to Emperor Xuanzong.<ref name="ebrey 2006 99">Ebrey (2006), 99.</ref><ref name="Benn 6">Benn, 6.</ref>

During the 44 year reign of Emperor Xuanzong, the Tang Dynasty was brought to its height, a golden age, a period of low economic [[inflation]], as well as a toning down of the excessively lavish lifestyle of the imperial court.<ref name="Benn 7"/><ref name="schafer 8"/> Seen as a progressive and benevolent ruler, Xuanzong even abolished the [[death penalty]] in the year 747, and all executions had to be approved beforehand by the emperor himself (which was relatively few, considering that there were only 24 executions in the year 730 alone).<ref name="Benn 47">Benn, 47.</ref> Xuanzong bowed to the consensus of his ministers on policy decisions and made efforts to fairly staff government ministries with different political factions.<ref name="adshead 47"/> His staunch Confucian chancellor [[Zhang Jiuling]] (673&ndash;740) worked to reduce [[deflation]] and increase the money supply by upholding the use of private coinage, although his aristocratic and [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocratic]] successor [[Li Linfu]] (d. 753) favored government monopoly over the issuance of coinage.<ref name="adshead 89">Adshead, 89.</ref> After 737 most of Xuanzong's confidence rested in his long-standing chancellor Li Linfu, who championed a more aggressive foreign policy employing non-Chinese generals.  This policy ultimately created the conditions for a massive rebellion against Xuanzong.<ref name="adshead 47 48">Adshead, 47&ndash;48.</ref>

===Decline===
====Rebellion and catastrophe====
[[Image:Buddha Leshan01.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Leshan Giant Buddha]], 71 m (233 ft) high; begun in 713, completed in 803.]]
The Tang Empire was at its height of power up until the middle of the 8th century, when the [[An Shi Rebellion]] (December 16, 755&ndash;February 17, 763) destroyed the prosperity of the empire. [[An Lushan]] was a half-[[Sogdiana|Sogdian]], half-[[Turkic peoples|Turk]] Tang commander since 744, had experience fighting the [[Khitan people|Khitans]] of [[Manchuria]] with a victory in 744,<ref name="ebrey 2006 100">Ebrey (2006), 100.</ref><ref name="eberhard 184">Eberhard, 184.</ref> yet most of his campaigns against the Khitans were unsuccessful.<ref>Xu et al, p. 455<U+2013>467</ref> He was given great responsibility in [[Hebei]], which allowed him to rebel with an army of more than one hundred thousand troops.<ref name="ebrey 2006 100"/> After capturing Luoyang, he named himself emperor of a new, but short-lived, [[Yan Dynasty]].<ref name="eberhard 184"/> Despite early victories scored by Tang General [[Guo Ziyi]] (697&ndash;781), the newly recruited troops of the army at the capital were no match for An Lushan's die-hard frontier veterans, so the court fled Chang'an.<ref name="ebrey 2006 100"/> While the heir apparent raised troops in [[Shanxi]] and Xuanzong fled to [[Sichuan]] province, they called upon the help of the [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] Turks in 756.<ref name="eberhard 185">Eberhard, 185.</ref>  The Uyghur khan [[Bayanchur Khan|Moyanchur]] was greatly excited at this prospect, and married his own daughter to the Chinese diplomatic envoy once he arrived, receiving in turn a Chinese princess as his bride.<ref name="eberhard 185"/> The Uyghurs helped recapture the Tang capital from the rebels, but they refused to leave until the Tang paid them an enormous sum of tribute in silk.<ref name="ebrey 2006 100"/><ref name="eberhard 185"/> Even Abbasid Arabs assisted the Tang in putting down An Lushan's rebellion.<ref name="schafer 9"/><ref name="eberhard 185"/> The [[Tibet]]ans took hold of the opportunity and raided many areas under Chinese control, and even after the Tibetan Empire had fallen apart in 842 (and the Uyghurs soon after) the Tang were in no position to reconquer Central Asia after 763.<ref name="ebrey 2006 100"/><ref name="sen 34">Sen, 34.</ref> So significant was this loss that half a century later ''jinshi'' examination candidates were required to write an essay on the causes of the Tang's decline.<ref name="gascoigne gascoigne 97">Gascoigne & Gascoigne, 97.</ref> Although An Lushan was killed by one of his eunuchs in 757,<ref name="eberhard 185"/> this time of troubles and widespread insurrection continued until rebel [[Shi Siming]] was killed by his own son in 763.<ref name="eberhard 185"/>
[[Image:China, 742.svg|thumb|300px|left|[[History of the political divisions of China#Provinces under the Tang Dynasty|Tang provinces]] by 742; An Lushan harassed the [[Khitans]] (their territory indicated on the map) in order to stir conflict, which provided him with more support from [[Chang'an]], hence strengthening his position. He eventually rose in rebellion in 755.]]
One of the legacies that the Tang government left since 710 was the gradual rise of regional military governors, the [[jiedushi]], who slowly came to challenge the power of the central government.<ref name="wang 91">Wang, 91.</ref>  After the An Shi Rebellion, the autonomous power and authority accumulated by the jiedushi in Hebei went beyond the central government's control. After a series of rebellions between 781 and 784 in today's Hebei, [[Shandong]], [[Hubei]] and [[Henan]] provinces, the government had to officially acknowledge the jiedushi's hereditary ruling without accreditation. The Tang government relied on these governors and their armies for protection and to suppress locals that would take up arms against the government. In return, the central government would acknowledge the rights of these governors to maintain their army, collect taxes and even to pass on their title to heirs.<ref name="ebrey 2006 100"/><ref>Graff (2008), 43&ndash;44.</ref> As time passed, these military governors slowly phased out the prominence of civil officials drafted by exams, and became more autonomous from central authority.<ref name="ebrey 2006 100"/> The rule of these powerful military governors lasted until 960, when a new civil order under the Song Dynasty was established. Also, the abandonment of the equal-field system meant that people could buy and sell land freely. Many poor fell into debt because of this, forced to sell their land to the wealthy, which led to the exponential growth of large estates.<ref name="ebrey 2006 100"/> With the breakdown of the land allocation system after 755, the central Chinese state barely interfered in agricultural management and acted merely as tax collector for roughly a millennium, save a few instances such as the Song's failed land nationalization during the 13th century war with the [[Mongols]].<ref>Adshead, 90&ndash;91.</ref>

With the central government collapsing in authority over the various regions of the empire, it was recorded in 845 that bandits and river pirates in parties of 100 or more began plundering settlements along the Yangtze River with little resistance.<ref name="bowman 105"/> In 858, enormous floods along the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] inundated vast tracts of land and terrain of the [[North China Plain]], which drowned tens of thousands of people in the process.<ref name="bowman 105">Bowman, 105.</ref>
[[Image:EightySevenCelestials3.jpg|thumb|600px|''Eighty Seven Celestials'', draft painting of a fresco by [[Wu Daozi]] (c. 685&ndash;758)]]The Chinese belief in the [[Mandate of Heaven]] granted to the ailing Tang was also challenged when natural calamities occurred, forcing many to believe the Heavens were displeased and that the Tang had lost their right to rule. Then in 873 a disastrous harvest shook the foundations of the empire; in some areas only half of all agricultural produce was gathered, and tens of thousands faced famine and starvation.<ref name="bowman 105"/> In the earlier period of the Tang, the central government was able to meet crises in the harvest, as it was recorded from 714&ndash;719 that the Tang government responded effectively to natural disasters by extending the price-regulation [[granary]] system throughout the country.<ref name="bowman 105"/> The central government was able then to build a large surplus stock of foods to ward off the rising danger of famine and increased agricultural productivity through [[land reclamation]].<ref name="bowman 105"/><ref name="Benn 7">Benn, 7.</ref> In the 9th century, however, the Tang government was nearly helpless in dealing with any calamity.

====Rebuilding and recovery====
[[Image:Xumipagodazhengding.jpg|thumb|[[Xumi Pagoda]], built in 636]]
Although these natural calamities and rebellions stained the reputation and hampered the effectiveness of the central government, the early 9th century is nonetheless viewed as a period of recovery for the Tang Dynasty.<ref name="Benn 15 17">Benn, 15<U+2013>17.</ref>  The government's withdrawal from its role in managing the economy had the unintended effect of stimulating trade, as more markets with less bureaucratic restrictions were opened up.<ref name="ebrey 2006 101">Ebrey (2006), 101.</ref><ref name="fairbank 84 85">Fairbank, 85.</ref> By 780, the old grain tax and labor service of the 7th century was replaced by a semiannual tax paid in cash, signifying the shift to a money economy bolstered by the merchant class.<ref name="schafer 9">Schafer, 9.</ref> Cities in the [[Jiangnan]] region to the south, such as [[Yangzhou]], [[Suzhou]], and [[Hangzhou]] prospered the most economically during the late Tang period.<ref name="ebrey 2006 101"/> Although weakened after the An Shi Rebellion, in 799 the Tang government's salt monopoly accounted for over half of the government's revenues, while the [[salt commission]] became one of the most powerful state agencies, run by capable ministers chosen as specialists in finance.<ref name="ebrey 2006 100"/> S.A.M. Adshead writes that this salt tax represents "the first time that an indirect tax, rather than tribute, levies on land or people, or profit from state enterprises such as mines, had been the primary resource of a major state."<ref name="adshead 50">Adshead, 50.</ref> Even after the power of the central government was in decline since the mid 8th century, it was still able to function and give out imperial orders on a massive scale. The ''Tangshu'' ([[Book of Tang]]) compiled in the year 945 recorded that in 828 the Tang government issued a decree that standardized [[irrigation]]al square-pallet [[chain pump]]s in the country:

{{quote|In the second year of the Taihe reign period [828 AD], in the second month...a standard model of the chain pump was issued from the palace, and the people of Jingzhao Fu (d footnote: the capital) were ordered by the emperor to make a considerable number of machines, for distribution to the people along the Zheng Bai Canal, for irrigation purposes.|<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 347">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 347.</ref>}}

The last great ambitious ruler of the Tang Dynasty was [[Emperor Xianzong of Tang]] (r. 805&ndash;820), his reign period aided by the fiscal reforms of the 780s, including the government monopoly on the salt industry.<ref name="Benn 14 15">Benn, 14<U+2013>15.</ref> He also had an effective well trained imperial army stationed at the capital led by his court eunuchs; this was the Army of Divine Strategy, numbering 240,000 in strength as recorded in 798.<ref name="Benn 15">Benn, 15.</ref> Between the years 806 and 819, Emperor Xianzong conducted seven major military campaigns to quell the rebellious provinces that had claimed autonomy from central authority, managing to subdue all but two of them.<ref name="Benn 16">Benn, 16.</ref><ref name="adshead 51">Adshead, 51.</ref> Under his reign there was a brief end to the hereditary jiedushi, as Xianzong appointed his own military officers and staffed the regional bureaucracies once again with civil officials.<ref name="Benn 16"/><ref name="adshead 51"/> However, Xianzong's successors proved less capable and more interested in the leisure of hunting, feasting, and playing outdoor sports, allowing eunuchs to amass more power as drafted scholar-officials caused strife in the bureaucracy with factional parties.<ref name="Benn 16"/>  The eunuchs' power became unchallenged after [[Emperor Wenzong of Tang]]'s (r. 826&ndash;840) failed plot to have them overthrown; instead the allies of Emperor Wenzong were publicly executed in the [[Chang'an#West Central Chang'an|West Market]] of Chang'an, by the eunuchs' command.<ref name="ebrey 2006 101"/>

====Collapse====
In addition to natural calamities and jiedushi amassing autonomous control, the [[Huang Chao|Huang Chao Rebellion]] (874&ndash;884) resulted in the sacking of both Chang'an and Luoyang, and took an entire decade to suppress.<ref name="eberhard 189 190">Eberhard, 189&ndash;190.</ref> Although the rebellion was defeated by the Tang, it never recovered from that crucial blow, weakening it for the future military powers to take over. There were also large groups of bandits, in the size of small armies, that ravaged the countryside in the last years of the Tang, who smuggled illicit salt, ambushed merchants and [[convoy]]s, and even besieged several walled cities.<ref name="ebrey 2006 108"/>

A certain [[Taizu of Later Liang|Zhu Wen]] (originally a salt smuggler) who had served under the rebel Huang had later surrendered to Tang forces, his military merit in betraying and defeating Huang's forces meaning rapid military promotions for him.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 320 321 footnote">Needham, 320<U+2013>321, footnote h.</ref>  In 907, after almost 300 years in power, the dynasty was ended when this military governor, Zhu Wen (known soon after as Taizu of Later Liang), deposed the last emperor of Tang, [[Emperor Ai of Tang]], and took the throne for himself. He established his [[Later Liang]] Dynasty, which thereby inaugurated the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period]]. A year later, the deposed Emperor Ai was poisoned to death by Zhu Wen.

Although cast in a negative light by many for usurping power from the Tang, Zhu Wen turned out to be a skilled administrator.  Emperor Taizu of Later Liang was also responsible for the building of a large [[seawall]], new walls and roads for the burgeoning city of [[Hangzhou]], which would later become the capital of the [[Southern Song Dynasty]].<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 320 321 footnote"/>

==Society and culture==
{{see also|Tang Dynasty art}}
[[Image:Tang-4.jpg|thumb|A Tang painting of a [[Bodhisattva]] holding an [[censer|incense burner]], from [[Dunhuang]]]]
Both the Sui and Tang Dynasties had turned away from the more [[feudal]] culture of the preceding Northern Dynasties, in favor of staunch civil [[Confucianism]].<ref name="ebrey 2006 91"/>  The governmental system was supported by a large class of Confucian intellectuals selected through either civil service examinations or recommendations.  In the Tang period, [[Daoism]] and [[Buddhism]] reigned as core ideologies as well, and played a large role in people's daily lives.  The Tang Chinese enjoyed feasting, drinking, holidays, sports, and all sorts of entertainment, while [[Chinese literature]] blossomed and was more widely accessible with new [[printing]] methods.

===Leisure in the Tang===
Much more than earlier periods, the Tang era was an era renowned for its time reserved for leisure activity, especially for those in the upper classes.<ref name="Benn 149">Benn 149.</ref> Many outdoor sports and activities were enjoyed during the Tang, including [[archery]],<ref name="Benn 39 170">Benn, 170.</ref> [[hunting]],<ref name="Benn 22 32">Benn, 22, 32.</ref> horse [[polo]],<ref name="Benn 16 90">Benn, 16, 90.</ref> [[cuju]] [[football]],<ref name="Benn 151 152">Benn, 151<U+2013>152.</ref> [[cockfighting]],<ref name="Benn 173 174">Benn, 173<U+2013>174.</ref> and even [[tug of war]].<ref name="Benn 152">Benn, 152.</ref> Government officials were granted [[vacation]]s during their tenure in office. Officials were granted 30 days off every three years to visit their parents if they lived 1000 miles/1609 km away, or 15 days off if the parents lived more than 167 miles/268 km away (travel time not included).<ref name="Benn 149"/>  Officials were granted nine days of vacation time for weddings of a son or daughter, and either five, three, or one days/day off for the [[nuptial]]s of close relatives (travel time not included).<ref name="Benn 149"/>  Officials also received a total of three days off for their son's capping initiation rite into manhood, and one day off for the ceremony of initiation rite of a close relative's son.<ref name="Benn 149"/> [[Traditional Chinese holidays]] such as [[Chinese New Year]], [[Lantern Festival]], [[Cold Food Festival]], and others were universal holidays. In the capital city of [[Chang'an]] there was always lively celebration, especially for the [[Lantern Festival]] since the city's nighttime [[curfew]] was lifted by the government for three days straight.<ref name="Benn 150 154">Benn, 150<U+2013>154.</ref>  Between the years 628 and 758, the imperial throne bestowed a total of sixty-nine grand [[carnival]]s nationwide, granted by the emperor in the case of special circumstances like important military victories, abundant [[harvest]]s after a long [[drought]] or [[famine]], the granting of [[amnesty|amnesties]], the installment of a new [[crown prince]], etc.<ref name="Benn 154 155">Benn, 154<U+2013>155.</ref> For special celebration in the Tang era, lavish and gargantuan-sized feasts were sometimes prepared, as the imperial court had staffed agencies to prepare the meals.<ref name="Benn 132">Benn, 132.</ref>  This included a prepared feast for 1,100 elders of Chang'an in 664, a feast for 3,500 officers of the Divine Strategy Army in 768, and a feast for 1,200 women of the palace and members of the imperial family in the year 826.<ref name="Benn 132"/> Drinking [[wine]] and [[alcoholic beverage]]s was heavily ingrained into Chinese culture, as people drank for nearly every social event.<ref name="Benn 142 147">Benn, 142<U+2013>147.</ref>  A court official in the 8th century allegedly had a serpentine-shaped structure called the 'Ale Grotto' built with 50,000 bricks on the groundfloor that each featured a drinking bowl for his friends to drink from.<ref name="Benn 143">Benn, 143.</ref>

===Chang'an, the Tang capital===
{{main|Chang'an}}
Although Chang'an was the site for the capital of the earlier Han and Jin dynasties, after subsequent destruction in warfare, it was the Sui Dynasty model that comprised the Tang era capital.  The roughly-square dimensions of the city had six miles (10 km) of outer walls running east to west, and more than five miles (8 km) of outer walls running north to south.<ref name="Ebrey 2006 93"/> From the large Mingde Gates located mid-center of the main southern wall, a wide city avenue stretched from there all the way north to the central administrative city, behind which was the Chentian Gate of the royal palace, or Imperial City. Intersecting this were fourteen main streets running east to west, while eleven main streets ran north to south. These main intersecting roads formed 108 rectangular wards with walls and four gates each, and each ward filled with multiple [[city block]]s.  The city was made famous for this checkerboard pattern of main roads with walled and gated districts, its layout even mentioned in one of Du Fu's poems.<ref name="ebrey 103">Ebrey, 103.</ref> During the [[Heian period]], the city of [[Heian ky<U+014D>]] (present-day [[Kyoto]]) of [[Japan]] like many cities was arranged in the checkerboard street grid pattern of the Tang capital and in accordance with traditional geomancy following the model of Chang'an.<ref name="ebrey 2006 92"/> Of these 108 wards in Chang'an, two of them (each the size of two regular city wards) were designated as government-supervised markets, and other space reserved for temples, gardens, ponds, etc.<ref name="Ebrey 2006 93"/> Throughout the entire city, there were 111 Buddhist monasteries, 41 Daoist abbeys, 38 family shrines, 2 official temples, 7 churches of foreign religions, 10 city wards with provincial transmission offices, 12 major inns, and 6 graveyards.<ref name="benn xiii">Benn, xiii.</ref> Some city wards were literally filled with open public playing fields or the backyards of lavish mansions for playing horse polo and [[cuju]] football.<ref name="benn xiv xv xvi xvii xviii">Benn, xiv, xv, xvi, xvii,  xviii</ref>

[[Image:Jingyun Bell.JPG|thumb|The bronze Jingyun Bell cast 711, height 247 cm high, weight 6,500 kg, now in the Xi'an Bell Tower]]
The Tang capital was the largest city in the world at its time, the population of the city wards and its outlying suburbs reaching 2 million inhabitants.<ref name="Ebrey 2006 93"/> The Tang capital was very cosmopolitan, with ethnicities of [[Persia]], Central Asia, Japan, Korea, [[Vietnam]], [[Tibet]], India, and many other places living within. Naturally, with this plethora of different ethnicities living in Chang'an, there were also many different practiced religions, such as [[Buddhism]], [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christianity]], [[Manichaeism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Judaism]], and [[Islam]] being practiced within. With widely open access to China that the [[Silk Road]] to the west facilitated, many foreign settlers were able to move east to China, while the city of Chang'an itself had about 25,000 foreigners living within.<ref name="ebrey 2006 112">Ebrey (2006), 112.</ref><ref name="studwell 4">Studwell, 4.</ref> Exotic green-eyed, blond-haired [[Tocharians|Tocharian ladies]] serving wine in [[agate]] and [[amber]] cups, singing, and dancing at taverns attracted customers.<ref name="schafer 21">Schafer, 21.</ref> If a foreigner in China pursued a Chinese woman for marriage, he was required to stay in China and was unable to take his bride back to his homeland, as stated in a law passed in 628 to protect women from temporary marriages with foreign envoys.<ref name="schafer 25">Schafer, 25.</ref>

Chang'an was the center of the central government, the home of the imperial family, and was filled with splendor and wealth. However, incidentally it was not the economic hub during the Tang Dynasty. The city of [[Yangzhou]] along the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] and close to the [[Yangtze River]] was the greatest economic center during the Tang era.<ref name="Benn 46">Benn, 46.</ref><ref name="schafer 17 18">Schafer, 17&ndash;18.</ref>
[[Image:Spring Outing of the Tang Court.jpg|left|thumb|300px|''Spring Outing of the Tang Court'', by [[Zhang Xuan]] (713&ndash;755)]]
Yangzhou was the headquarters for the Tang's [[government monopoly]] on [[salt]], and the greatest industrial center of China; it acted as a midpoint in shipping of  foreign goods that would be organized and distributed to the major cities of the north.<ref name="Benn 46"/><ref name="schafer 17 18"/> Much like the seaport of [[Guangzhou]] in the south, Yangzhou boasted thousands of foreign traders from all across Asia.<ref name="schafer 17 18"/><ref>Reischauer, 143&ndash;144.</ref>

There was also the secondary capital city of [[Luoyang]], which was the favored capital of the two by [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]]. In the year 691 she had more than 100,000 families (more than 500,000 people) from around the region of Chang'an move to populate Luoyang instead.<ref name="Benn 46"/>  With a population of about a million, Luoyang became the second largest capital in the empire, and with its close proximity to the Luo River it benefited from southern agricultural fertility and trade traffic of the Grand Canal.<ref name="Benn 46"/>  However, the Tang court eventually demoted its capital status and did not visit Luoyang after the year 743, when Chang'an's problem of acquiring adequate supplies and stores for the year was solved.<ref name="Benn 46"/> As early as 736, granaries were built at critical points along the route from Yangzhou to Chang'an, which eliminated shipment delays, spoilage, and pilfering.<ref name="schafer 18 19">Schafer, 18&ndash;19.</ref> An artificial lake used as a transshipment pool was dredged east of Chang'an in 743, where curious northerners could finally see the array of boats found in southern China, delivering tax and tribute items to the imperial court.<ref name="schafer 19 20">Schafer, 19&ndash;20.</ref>

===Literature=== 
{{main|Chinese literature|Chinese poetry}}
The Tang period was a [[golden age]] of Chinese literature and [[Chinese art|art]].  There are over 48,900 poems penned by some 2,200 Tang authors that have survived until modern times.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 120"/><ref name="harper 33">Harper, 33.</ref> Perfecting one's skills in the composition of poetry became a required study for those wishing to pass imperial examinations,<ref name="Benn 259">Benn, 259.</ref> while poetry was also heavily competitive; poetry contests amongst esteemed guests at [[banquet]]s and courtiers of elite social gatherings was common in the Tang period.<ref name="Benn 137">Benn, 137.</ref>  Poetry styles that were popular in the Tang included [[Shi (poetry)#Gushi|gushi]] and [[Shi (poetry)#Jintishi|jintishi]], with the renowned Tang poet [[Li Bai]] (701&ndash;762) famous for the former style, and Tang poets like [[Wang Wei (8th century poet)|Wang Wei]] (701&ndash;761) and [[Cui Hao (poet)|Cui Hao]] (704&ndash;754) famous for their use of the latter. Jintishi poetry, or regulated verse, is in the form of eight-line [[stanza]]s or seven [[Chinese characters|character]]s per line with a fixed pattern of tones that required the second and third couplets to be antithetical (although the [[antithesis]] is often lost in translation to other languages).<ref name="ebrey 2006 102">Ebrey (2006), 102.</ref> Tang poems in particular remain the most popular out of every historical era of China.  This great emulation of Tang era poetry began in the Song Dynasty period, as it was Yan Yu (active 1194&ndash;1245) who asserted that he was the first to designate the poetry of the High Tang (c. 713&ndash;766) era as the orthodox material with "canonical status within the classical poetic tradition."<ref name="Yu 76"/> At the pinnacle of all the Tang poets, Yan Yu had reserved the position of highest esteem for that of [[Du Fu]] (712&ndash;770),<ref name="Yu 76">Yu, 76.</ref> a man who would not be viewed as such in his own era of poetic competitors, and branded by his peers as an anti-traditional rebel.<ref name="Yu 75">Yu, 75.</ref> Below is an example of Du Fu's poetry, ''To My Retired Friend Wei'' (Chinese: <U+8D08><U+885B><U+516B><U+8655><U+58EB>). Like many other poems in the Tang it featured the theme of a long parting between friends, which was often due to officials being frequently transferred to the provinces:<ref name="ebrey cambridge 120">Ebrey (1999), 120.</ref>

There were other important literary forms besides poetry during the Tang period. There was [[Duan Chengshi]]'s (d. 863) ''[[Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang]]'', an entertaining collection of foreign legends and hearsay, reports on natural phenomena, short [[anecdote]]s, mythical and mundane tales, as well as notes on various subjects. The exact literary category or classification that Duan's large informal narrative would fit into is still debated amongst scholars and historians.<ref name="reed 121">Reed, 121.</ref>

Short story fiction and tales were also popular during the Tang, one of the more famous ones being ''Yingying's Biography'' by [[Yuan Zhen]] (779&ndash;831), which was widely circulated in his own time and by the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1279&ndash;1368) became the basis for plays in [[Chinese opera]].<ref name="ebrey 2006 104 105">Ebrey (2006), 104&ndash;105.</ref><ref name="wong 1979 97">Wong (1979), 97.</ref> Timothy C. Wong places this story within the wider context of Tang love tales, which often share the plot designs of quick passion, inescapable societal pressure leading to the abandonment of romance, followed by a period of [[Melancholia|melancholy]].<ref name="wong 1979 95 99">Wong (1979), 95&ndash;100.</ref> Wong states that this scheme lacks the undying vows and total self-commitment to love found in Western romances such as ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', but that underlying traditional Chinese values of inseparableness of self from one's environment (including human society) served to create the necessary fictional device of romantic tension.<ref>Wong (1979), 98&ndash;99.</ref>

[[Image:Xi'anwildgoosepagoda2.JPG|thumb|[[Small Wild Goose Pagoda]], built by 709, was adjacent to the Dajianfu Temple in Chang'an, where Buddhist monks from India and elsewhere gathered to translate [[Sanskrit]] texts into Chinese<ref name="kiang 12">Kiang, 12.</ref>]]
There were large [[encyclopedia]]s published in the Tang. The ''[[Yiwen Leiju]]'' encyclopedia was compiled in 624 by the chief editor [[Ouyang Xun]] (557&ndash;641) as well as [[Linghu Defen]] (582&ndash;666) and [[Chen Shuda]] (d. 635). The encyclopedia ''[[Treatise on Astrology of the Kaiyuan Era]]'' was fully compiled in 729 by [[Gautama Siddha]] (fl. 8th century), an ethnic Indian astronomer, astrologer, and scholar born in the capital Chang'an.

[[History of geography#China|Chinese geographers]] such as [[Jia Dan]] wrote accurate descriptions of places far abroad. In his work written between 785 and 805, he described the sea route going into the mouth of the [[Persian Gulf]], and that the medieval [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]]s (whom he called the people of Luo-He-Yi) had erected 'ornamental pillars' in the sea that acted as [[lighthouse]] beacons for ships that might go astray.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 661">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 661.</ref> Confirming Jia's reports about lighthouses in the Persian Gulf, Arabic writers a century after Jia wrote of the same structures, writers such as [[al-Mas'udi]] and [[al-Muqaddasi]]. The Tang Dynasty Chinese diplomat [[Wang Xuance]] traveled to [[Magadha]] (modern northeastern [[India]]) during the 7th century.<ref name="sen 9 22 24">Sen, 9, 22&ndash;24.</ref> Afterwards he wrote the book ''Zhang Tianzhu Guotu'' (Illustrated Accounts of Central India), which included a wealth of geographical information.<ref name="needham volume 3 511">Needham, Volume 3, 511.</ref>

Many histories of previous dynasties were compiled between 636 and 659 by court officials during and shortly after the reign of [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]]. These included the ''[[Book of Liang]]'', ''[[Book of Chen]]'', ''[[Book of Northern Qi]]'', ''[[Book of Zhou]]'', ''[[Book of Sui]]'', ''[[Book of Jin]]'', ''[[History of Northern Dynasties]]'' and the ''[[History of Southern Dynasties]]''. Although not included in the official ''[[Twenty-Four Histories]]'', the ''[[Tongdian]]'' and ''[[Tang Huiyao]]'' were nonetheless valuable written historical works of the Tang period. The ''[[Shitong]]'' written by [[Liu Zhiji]] in 710 was a meta-history, as it covered the history of [[Chinese historiography]] in past centuries until his time. The ''[[Great Tang Records on the Western Regions]]'', compiled by [[Bianji]], recounted the journey of [[Xuanzang]], the Tang era's most renowned [[Buddhist monk]].

The [[Classical Prose Movement]] was spurred large in part by the writings of Tang authors [[Liu Zongyuan]] (773&ndash;819) and [[Han Yu]] (768&ndash;824). This new prose style broke away from the poetry tradition of the 'piantiwen' style begun in the ancient Han Dynasty. Although writers of the Classical Prose Movement imitated 'piantiwen', they criticized it for its often vague content and lack of colloquial language, focusing more on clarity and precision to make their writing more direct.<ref name="ebrey 2006 106">Ebrey (2006), 106.</ref> This ''guwen'' (archaic prose) style can be traced back to Han Yu, and would become largely associated with [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] [[Neo-Confucianism]].<ref name="huters 52">Huters, 52.</ref>

===Religion and philosophy===
{{main|Religion in China|Chinese philosophy}}
[[Image:TangBodhisattva.JPG|thumb|A Tang Dynasty sculpture of a [[Bodhisattva]]]]
Since ancient times, the Chinese believed in [[Chinese folk religion|a folk religion]] that incorporated many deities. The Chinese believed that the afterlife was a reality parallel to the living world, complete with its own bureaucracy and afterlife currency needed by dead ancestors.<ref name="whitfield 333">Whitfield, 333.</ref> This is reflected in many short stories written in the Tang about people accidentally winding up in the realm of the dead, only to come back and report their experiences.<ref name="whitfield 333"/>

[[Buddhism]], originating in India around the time of [[Confucius]], continued to flourish during the Tang period and was adopted by the imperial family, becoming thoroughly sinicized and a permanent part of Chinese traditional culture. In an age before [[Neo-Confucianism]] and figures such as [[Zhu Xi]] (1130&ndash;1200), Buddhism had begun to flourish in China during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]], and became the dominant ideology during the prosperous Tang. Buddhist monasteries played an integral role in Chinese society, offering lodging for travelers in remote areas, schools for children throughout the country, and a place for urban literati to stage social events and gatherings such as going-away parties.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 121">Ebrey (1999), 121.</ref> Buddhist monasteries were also engaged in the economy, since their land property and serfs gave them enough revenues to set up mills, oil presses, and other enterprises.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 122">Ebrey (1999), 122.</ref><ref name="eberhard">Eberhard, 181.</ref><ref name="adshead 86">Adshead, 86.</ref> Although the monasteries retained 'serfs', these monastery dependents could actually own property and employ others to help them in their work, including their own slaves.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 126">Ebrey (1999), 126.</ref>

The prominent status of Buddhism in Chinese culture began to decline as the dynasty and central government declined as well during the late 8th century to 9th century. Buddhist [[convent]]s and [[List of Buddhist temples|temples]] that were exempt from state taxes beforehand were targeted by the state for taxation. In 845 [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang]] finally shut down 4,600 Buddhist monasteries along with 40,000 temples and shrines, forcing 260,000 Buddhist monks and nuns to return to [[Secularity (non-religiosity)|secular]] life;<ref name="ebrey 2006 96"/><ref name="fairbank 86">Fairbank, 86.</ref> this episode would later be dubbed one of the [[Four Buddhist Persecutions in China]].  Although the ban would be lifted just a few years after, Buddhism never regained its once dominant status in Chinese culture.<ref name="ebrey 2006 96"/><ref name="fairbank 86"/><ref name="cambridge 124">Ebrey (1999), 124.</ref><ref name="harper 34">Harper, 34.</ref> This situation also came about through new revival of interest in native Chinese philosophies, such as Confucianism and Daoism. [[Han Yu]] (786&ndash;824)<U+2014>who Arthur F. Wright stated was a "brilliant [[polemicist]] and ardent [[Xenophobia|xenophobe]]"<U+2014>was one of the first men of the Tang to denounce Buddhism.<ref name="Wright 88"/> Although his contemporaries found him crude and obnoxious, he would foreshadow the later persecution of Buddhism in the Tang, as well as the revival of Confucian theory with the rise of Neo-Confucianism of the Song Dynasty.<ref name="Wright 88">Wright, 88.</ref> Nonetheless, [[Zen|Ch<U+00E1>n Buddhism]] gained popularity amongst the educated elite.<ref name="ebrey 2006 96">Ebrey (2006), 96.</ref> There were also many famous Chan monks from the Tang era, such as [[Mazu Daoyi]], [[Baizhang]], and [[Huangbo Xiyun]]. The sect of [[Pure Land Buddhism]] initiated by the Chinese monk [[Huiyuan (Buddhist)|Huiyuan]] (334&ndash;416) was also just as popular as Chan Buddhism during the Tang.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 123">Ebrey (1999), 123.</ref>

Rivaling Buddhism was [[Daoism]], a native Chinese philosophical and religious belief system that found its roots in the book of the ''[[Tao Te Ching|Daodejing]]'' (attributed to [[Laozi]] in the 6th century BC) and the ''[[Zhuangzi]]''. The ruling Li family of the Tang Dynasty actually claimed descent from the ancient Laozi.<ref name="Benn 60"/> On numerous occasions where Tang princes would become crown prince or Tang princesses taking vows as Daoist priestesses, their lavish former mansions would be converted into Daoist [[abbey]]s and places of worship.<ref name="Benn 60"/> Many Daoists were associated with [[alchemy]] in their pursuits to find an [[Elixir of life|elixir of immortality]] and a means to create gold from concocted mixtures of many other elements.<ref name="fairbank 81">Fairbank, 81.</ref> Although they never achieved their goals in either of these futile pursuits, they did contribute to the discovery of new metal alloys, porcelain products, and new dyes.<ref name="fairbank 81"/> The historian Joseph Needham labeled the work of the Daoist alchemists as "proto-science rather than pseudo-science."<ref name="fairbank 81"/> However, the close connection between Daoism and alchemy, which some [[Sinology|sinologists]] have asserted, is refuted by [[Nathan Sivin]], who states that alchemy was just as prominent (if not more so) in the secular sphere and practiced more often by laymen.<ref>Sivin, Nathan.

The Tang Dynasty also officially recognized various foreign religions. The [[Assyrian Church of the East]], otherwise known as the [[Nestorianism in China|Nestorian Christian Church]], was given recognition by the Tang court. In 781, the [[Nestorian Stele]] was created in order to honor the achievements of their community in China. A Christian monastery was established in Shaanxi province where the [[Daqin Pagoda]] still stands, and inside the pagoda there is Christian-themed artwork. Although the religion largely died out after the Tang, it was revived in China following the Mongol invasions of the 13th century.<ref name="gernet 215">Gernet, 215.</ref>

===Tang women===
[[Image:Chou Fang 004.jpg|thumb|250px|''Beauties Wearing Flowers'', by [[Zhou Fang]], 8th century]]
Women's social rights and social status during the Tang era were incredibly liberal-minded for the medieval period. However, this was largely reserved for urbane women of elite status, as men and women in the rural countryside labored hard in their different set of tasks; with wives and daughters responsible for more domestic tasks of weaving [[textile]]s and rearing of [[silk worm]]s, while men tended to farming in the fields.<ref name="Benn 32"/> There were many women in the Tang era who gained access to religious authority by taking vows as Daoist priestesses.<ref name="Benn 60">Benn, 60.</ref> The head mistresses of the [[bordello]]s in the [[Chang'an#East Central Chang'an|North Hamlet]] (also known as the [[Homosexuality in China|Gay Quarters]]) of the capital Chang'an acquired large amounts of wealth and power.<ref name="Benn 64 66">Benn, 64<U+2013>66.</ref> Their high-class [[courtesan]]s, who very much resembled Japanese [[geisha]]s,<ref name = "Benn 64"/> were well respected. These courtesans were known as great singers and poets, supervised banquets and feasts, knew the rules to all the [[drinking game]]s, and were trained to have the utmost respectable [[table manners]].<ref name="Benn 64">Benn, 64.</ref><ref name="Benn 66">Benn, 66.</ref>

[[Image:Joueuse de polo Tang 29102.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Woman playing polo, 8th century]]
Although they were renowned for their polite behavior, the courtesans were known to dominate the conversation amongst elite men, and were not afraid to openly castigate or criticize prominent male guests who talked too much or too loudly, boasted too much of their accomplishments, or had in some way ruined dinner for everyone by rude behavior (on one occasion a courtesan even beat up a drunken man who had insulted her).<ref name="Benn 66"/> When singing to entertain guests, courtesans not only composed the lyrics to their own songs, but they popularized a new form of lyrical verse by singing lines written by various renowned and famous men in Chinese history.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 120"/>

It was fashionable for women to be full-figured (or plump). Men enjoyed the presence of assertive, active women.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 114 115">Ebrey (1999), 114&ndash;115.</ref><ref name="gernet 165 166">Gernet, 165&ndash;166.</ref> The foreign horse-riding sport of [[polo]] from Persia became a wildly popular trend amongst the Chinese elite, and women often played the sport (as glazed [[earthenware]] figurines from the time period portray).<ref name="ebrey cambridge 114 115"/> The preferred hairstyle for women was to bunch their hair up like "an elaborate edifice above the forehead,"<ref name="gernet 165 166"/> while affluent ladies wore extravagant head ornaments, combs, pearl necklaces, face powders, and perfumes.<ref name="gernet 165">Gernet, 165.</ref> A law was passed in 671 which attempted to force women to wear hats with veils again in order to promote decency, but these laws were ignored as some women started wearing caps and even no hats at all, as well as men's riding clothes and boots, and tight-sleeved bodices.<ref name="schafer 28 29">Schafer, 28&ndash;29.</ref>

There were some prominent court women after the era of Empress Wu, such as [[Yang Guifei]] (719&ndash;756), who had Emperor Xuanzong appoint many of her relatives and cronies to important ministerial and martial positions.<ref name="ebrey 2006 99"/>

===Tea, food, and necessities===
[[Image:Dame Chine Guimet 291003.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[terracotta]] sculpture of a woman, 7th<U+2013>8th century; during the Tang era, female hosts prepared feasts, tea parties, and played drinking games with their guests.]]
During the earlier [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] (420&ndash;589), and perhaps even earlier, the drinking of [[tea]] became popular in southern China. (Tea comes from the leaf buds of [[Camelia sinensis]], native to southwestern China.) Tea was viewed then as a beverage of tasteful pleasure and with pharmacological purpose as well.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 120">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 120.</ref> During the Tang Dynasty, tea became synonymous with everything sophisticated in society. The Tang poet [[Lu Tong]] (790&ndash;835) devoted most of his poetry to his love of tea. The 8th century author [[Lu Yu]] (known as the Sage of Tea) even wrote a treatise on the art of drinking tea, called the ''[[Classic of Tea]]'' (Ch<U+00E1>j<U+012B>ng).<ref name="Ebrey 1999 95">Ebrey (1999), 95.</ref> Tea was also enjoyed by Uyghur Turks; when riding into town, the first places they visited were the tea shops.<ref name="schafer 20"/> Although [[wrapping paper]] had been used in China since the 2nd century BC,<ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 122">Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 122</ref> during the Tang Dynasty the Chinese were using wrapping paper as folded and sewn square [[bag]]s to hold and preserve the flavor of tea leaves.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 122"/> Indeed, paper found many other uses besides writing and wrapping during the Tang era. Earlier, the first recorded use of [[toilet paper]] was made in 589 by the scholar-official [[Yan Zhitui]] (531&ndash;591),<ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 123">Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 123.</ref> and in 851 an [[Arab]] [[Muslim]] traveler commented on how the Tang era Chinese were not careful about cleanliness because they did not wash with water when going to the bathroom; instead, he said, the Chinese simply used paper to wipe themselves.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 123"/>

In ancient times, the Chinese had outlined the five most basic foodstuffs known as the five grains: [[sesamum]], [[legume]]s, [[wheat]], [[panicle]]d [[millet]], and [[glutinous]] millet.<ref name="song 3 4">Song, 3<U+2013>4.</ref> The [[Ming Dynasty]] [[Encyclopedia|encyclopedist]] [[Song Yingxing]] (1587&ndash;1666) noted that [[rice]] was not counted amongst the five grains from the time of the legendary and deified Chinese sage [[Shennong]] (the existence of whom Yingxing wrote was "an uncertain matter") into the 2nd millenniums BC, because the properly wet and humid climate in [[southern China]] for growing rice was not yet fully settled or cultivated by the Chinese.<ref name="song 3 4"/> 

[[Image:Chajing.jpeg|thumb|left|A page of [[Lu Yu]]'s ''[[Classic of Tea]]'']]
During the Tang, the many common foodstuffs and cooking ingredients in addition to those already listed were [[barley]], [[garlic]], [[salt]], [[turnip]]s, [[soybean]]s, [[pear]]s, [[apricot]]s, [[peach]]es, [[apple]]s, [[pomegranate]]s, [[jujube]]s, [[rhubarb]], [[hazelnut]]s, [[pine nut]]s, [[chestnut]]s, [[walnut]]s, [[yam (vegetable)|yam]]s, [[taro]], etc.<ref name="Benn 120">Benn, 120.</ref> The various meats that were consumed included [[pork]], [[chicken]], [[Lamb (meat)|lamb]] (especially preferred in the north), [[sea otter]], [[bear]] (which was hard to catch, but there were recipes for steamed, boiled, and [[marinate]]d bear), and even [[Bactrian camel]]s.<ref name="Benn 120"/> In the south along the coast meat from seafood was by default the most common, as the Chinese enjoyed eating cooked [[jellyfish]] with [[cinnamon]], [[Sichuan pepper]], [[cardamom]], and [[ginger]], as well as [[oyster]]s with [[wine]], fried [[squid]] with ginger and [[vinegar]], [[horseshoe crab]]s and [[crab|red crab]]s, [[shrimp]], and [[Tetraodontidae|pufferfish]], which the Chinese called 'river piglet'.<ref name="Benn 121">Benn, 121.</ref>  Some foods were also off-limits, as the Tang court encouraged people not to eat [[beef]] (since the [[cattle|bull]] was a valuable [[draft animal]]), and from 831 to 833 [[Emperor Wenzong of Tang]] even banned the slaughter of [[cattle]] on the grounds of his religious convictions to Buddhism.<ref name="Benn 125">Benn, 125.</ref> From the trade overseas and over land, the Chinese acquired golden [[peach]]es from [[Samarkand]], [[Date Palm|date palm]]s, [[pistachio]]s, and [[fig]]s from Persia, pine seeds and [[ginseng]] roots from [[Korea]], and [[mango]]es from [[Southeast Asia]].<ref name="Benn 123">Benn, 123.</ref><ref name="schafer 1 2">Schafer, 1&ndash;2.</ref> In China, there was a great demand for [[sugar]]; during the reign of [[Harsha]] (r. 606&ndash;647) over [[North India]], Indian envoys to Tang China brought two makers of sugar who successfully taught the Chinese how to cultivate [[sugarcane]].<ref name="sen 38 40">Sen, 38&ndash;40.</ref><ref name="adshead 76 83 84">Adshead, 76, 83&ndash;84.</ref> [[Cotton]] also came from India as a finished product from [[Bengal]], although it was during the Tang that the Chinese began to grow and process cotton, and by the Yuan Dynasty it became the prime textile fabric in China.<ref name="adshead 83"/>

Methods of [[food preservation]] were important and practiced throughout China. The common people used simple methods of preservation, such as digging deep ditches and trenches, [[brining]], and salting their foods.<ref name="Benn 126 127">Benn, 126<U+2013>127.</ref> The emperor had large ice pits located in the parks in and around Chang'an for preserving food, while the wealthy and elite had their own smaller ice pits.<ref name="Benn 126">Benn, 126.</ref>  Each year the emperor had laborers carve 1000 blocks of ice from frozen creeks in mountain valleys, each block with the dimension of 0.91&nbsp;m (3&nbsp;ft) by 0.91&nbsp;m by 1.06&nbsp;m (3<U+00BD>&nbsp;ft).<ref name="Benn 126"/> There were many frozen delicacies enjoyed during the summer, especially chilled [[melon]].<ref name="Benn 126"/>

===Clockworks and timekeeping===
Technology during the Tang period was built also upon the precedents of the past. The mechanical gear systems of [[Zhang Heng]] (78&ndash;139) and [[Ma Jun]] (fl. 3rd century) gave the Tang engineer, astronomer, and monk [[Yi Xing]] (683&ndash;727) a great source of influence when he invented the world's first clockwork [[escapement]] mechanism in 725.<ref name="needham volume 3 319">Needham, Volume 3, 319.</ref> This was used alongside a [[Water clock|clepsydra]] clock and [[waterwheel]] to power a rotating [[armillary sphere]] in representation of [[astronomical]] observation.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 473 475">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 473<U+2013>475.</ref>  Yi Xing's device also had a mechanically-timed bell that was struck automatically every hour, and a drum that was struck automatically every quarter hour; essentially, a [[striking clock]].<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 473 474">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 473<U+2013>474.</ref> Yi Xing's [[astronomical clock]] and water-powered armillary sphere became well known throughout the country, since students attempting to pass the imperial examinations by 730 had to write an essay on the device as an exam requirement.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 475">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 475.</ref> However, the most common type of public and palace timekeeping device was the inflow clepsydra, improved in about 610 by the Sui Dynasty engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai when they provided a [[steelyard balance]] that allowed seasonal adjustment in the [[pressure head]] of the compensating tank and could then control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 480">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 480.</ref>

===Mechanical delights and automatons===
There were many other technically impressive mechanical inventions during the Tang era. This included a 0.91 m (3 ft) tall mechanical wine server of the early 8th century that was in the shape of an artificial mountain, carved out of iron and rested on a [[lacquer]]ed-wooden tortoise frame.<ref name="Benn 144">Benn, 144.</ref> This intricate device used a hydraulic pump that siphoned wine out of metal [[Chinese dragon|dragon]]-headed faucets, as well as tilting bowls that were timed to dip wine down, by force of [[gravity]] when filled, into an artificial lake that had intricate iron leaves popping up as trays for placing party treats.<ref name="Benn 144"/> Furthermore, as the historian Charles Benn describes it:
[[Image:Guardian figures, earthenware with pigment, Tang Dynasty.JPG|thumb|left|Wooden statues of tomb guardians; mechanical-driven wooden statues served as cup-bearers, wine-pourers, dancers, and others in this age.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 160">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 160.</ref>]]
{{Quote|Midway up the southern side of the mountain was a dragon...the beast opened its mouth and spit brew into a goblet seated on a large [iron] lotus leaf beneath. When the cup was 80 percent full, the dragon ceased spewing ale, and a guest immediately seized the goblet. If he was slow in draining the cup and returning it to the leaf, the door of a pavilion at the top of the mountain opened and a mechanical wine server, dressed in a cap and gown, emerged with a wooden bat in his hand. As soon as the guest returned the goblet, the dragon refilled it, the wine server withdrew, and the doors of the pavilion closed...A pump siphoned the ale that flowed into the ale pool through a hidden hole and returned the brew to the reservoir [holding more than 16 quarts/15 liters of wine] inside the mountain.|<ref name="Benn 144"/>}}

Although the use of a teasing mechanical puppet in this wine-serving device was certainly ingenious, the use of mechanical puppets in China date back to the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221&ndash;207 BC)<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 158">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 158.</ref> while [[Ma Jun]] in the 3rd century had an entire mechanical puppet theater operated by the rotation of a waterwheel.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 158"/> There was also an automatic wine-server known in the ancient [[Greco-Roman]] world, a design of [[Heron of Alexandria]] that employed an urn with an inner valve and a lever device similar to the one described above. There are many stories of [[automaton]]s used in the Tang, including general Yang Wulian's wooden statue of a monk who stretched his hands out to collect contributions; when the amount of coins reached a certain weight, the mechanical figure moved his arms to deposit them in a satchel.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 163">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 163.</ref> This weight-and-lever mechanism was exactly like Heron's penny [[slot machine]].<ref>Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 163 footnote c.</ref> Another device included one by Wang Ju, whose "wooden otter" could allegedly catch fish; Needham suspects a [[Spring (device)|spring trap]] of some kind was employed here.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 163"/>

===Medicine=== 
[[Image:Square mirror with phoenix motif, Tang Dynasty.jpg|thumb|right|A square [[bronze mirror]] with [[Fenghuang|a phoenix]] motif of gold and silver inlaid with [[lacquer]], 8th century]]
The Chinese of the Tang era were also very interested in the benefits of officially classifying all of the [[Traditional Chinese medicine|medicines]] used in [[pharmacology]]. In 657, [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang]] (r. 649&ndash;683) commissioned the literary project of publishing an official ''[[materia medica]]'', complete with text and aid of illustrated drawing for 833 different medicinal substances taken from different stones, minerals, metals, plants, herbs, animals, vegetables, fruits, and cereal crops.<ref name="benn 235">Benn, 235.</ref> In addition to compiling pharmacopeias, the Tang fostered learning in medicine by upholding imperial medical colleges, state examinations for doctors, and publishing forensic manuals for physicians.<ref name="adshead 83">Adshead, 83.</ref> Authors of medicine in the Tang include Zhen Qian (d. 643) and [[Sun Simiao]] (581&ndash;682), the former who first identified in writing that patients with [[diabetes]] had an excess of [[sugar]] in their [[urine]], and the latter who was the first to recognize that diabetic patients should avoid consuming alcohol and [[starch]]y foods.<ref name="temple 1986 132 133">Temple (1986), 132&ndash;133.</ref> As written by Zhen Qian and others in the Tang, the [[thyroid]] glands of sheep and pigs were successfully used to treat [[goiter]]s; thyroid extracts were not used to treat patients with goiter in the West until 1890.<ref name="temple 1986 134 135">Temple (1986), 134&ndash;135.</ref>

[[Image:Dunhuang star map.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Dunhuang map]], a [[star map]] showing the North Polar region. circa 700.<ref>Xi (1981), 464.</ref> Constellations were divided into three "schools" distinguished with different colors: white, black and yellow for stars of [[Wu Xian (astronomer)|Wu Xian]], [[Gan De]] and [[Shi Shen]] respectively. The whole set of star maps contained 1,300 stars.]]

===Structural engineering===
In the realm of technical [[Chinese architecture]], there were also government standard building codes, outlined in the early Tang book of the ''Yingshan Ling'' (National Building Law).<ref name="guo 1">Guo, 1.</ref> Fragments of this book have survived in the ''Tang L<U+00FC>'' (The Tang Code),<ref name="guo 3">Guo, 3.</ref> while the Song Dynasty architectural manual of the ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'' (State Building Standards) by [[Architecture of the Song Dynasty#Literature|Li Jie]] (1065&ndash;1101) in 1103 is the oldest existing technical treatise on Chinese architecture that has survived in full.<ref name="guo 1"/> During the reign of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] (712&ndash;756) there were 34,850 registered [[craftsmen]] serving the state, managed by the Agency of Palace Buildings (Jingzuo Jian).<ref name="guo 3"/>

===Cartography===
In the realm of [[cartography]], there were further advances beyond the map-makers of the Han Dynasty. When the Tang chancellor [[Pei Ju]] (547&ndash;627) was working for the Sui Dynasty as a Commercial Commissioner in 605, he created a well-known gridded map with a [[Scale (map)|graduated scale]] in the tradition of [[Pei Xiu]] (224&ndash;271).<ref>Needham, Volume 3, 538<U+2013>540.</ref><ref name="needham volume 3 543">Needham, Volume 3, 543.</ref> The Tang chancellor [[Xu Jingzong]] (592&ndash;672) was also known for his map of China drawn in the year 658.<ref name="needham volume 3 543"/> In the year 785 the [[Emperor Dezong of Tang|Emperor Dezong]] had the geographer and cartographer [[Jia Dan]] (730&ndash;805) complete a map of China and her former colonies in Central Asia.<ref name="needham volume 3 543"/> Upon its completion in 801, the map was 9.1 m (30 ft) in length and 10 m (33 ft) in height, mapped out on a grid scale of one inch equaling one hundred ''[[li (unit)|li]]'' (Chinese unit of measuring distance).<ref name="needham volume 3 543"/> A Chinese map of 1137 is similar in complexity to the one made by Jia Dan, carved on a stone stele with a grid scale of 100 li.<ref>Needham, Volume 3, Plate LXXXI.</ref> However, the only type of map that has survived from the Tang period are [[star chart]]s. Despite this, [[History of cartography#China|the earliest extant terrain maps of China]] come from the ancient [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]];  maps from the 4th century BC that were excavated in 1986.<ref>Hsu (1993), 90.</ref>

===Alchemy, gas cylinders, and air conditioning===
[[Image:Plat <U+00E0> offrandes Chine Mus<U+00E9>e Guimet 2418 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A rounded ceramic plate with "three colors" ([[sancai]]) glaze design, 8th century]]

The Chinese of the Tang period employed complex chemical formulas for an array of different purposes, often found through experiments of [[alchemy]]. These included a [[waterproof]] and dust-repelling cream or [[varnish]] for clothes and weapons, [[fireproof]] [[cement]] for glass and porcelain wares, a waterproof cream applied to silk clothes of underwater [[diver]]s, a cream designated for polishing bronze mirrors, and many other useful formulas.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 4 452">Needham, Volume 5, Part 4, 452.</ref> The vitrified, translucent ceramic known as [[porcelain]] was invented in China during the Tang, although many types of glazed ceramics preceded it.<ref>Wood (1999), 49.</ref><ref name="adshead 80">Adshead (2004), 80.</ref>

Ever since the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC &ndash; 220 AD), the Chinese had drilled deep [[borehole]]s to transport [[natural gas]] from [[Pipeline transport|bamboo pipelines]] to stoves where [[cast iron]] evaporation pans boiled [[brine]] to extract [[salt]].<ref>Temple (1986), 78&ndash;79.</ref> During the Tang Dynasty, a [[gazetteer]] of Sichuan province stated that at one of these 182 m (600 ft) 'fire wells', men collected natural gas into portable bamboo tubes which could be carried around for dozens of km (mi) and still produce a flame.<ref name="temple 1986 79 80">Temple (1986), 79&ndash;80.</ref> These were essentially the first [[gas cylinder]]s; Robert Temple assumes [[Tap (valve)|some sort of tap]] was used for this device.<ref name="temple 1986 79 80"/>

The inventor Ding Huan (fl. 180 AD) of the [[Han Dynasty]] invented a [[Fan (mechanical)|rotary fan]] for [[air conditioning]], with seven wheels 3 m (10 ft) in diameter and manually powered.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 99 151 233">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 99, 151, 233.</ref> In 747, Emperor Xuanzong had the Cool Hall (''Liang Tian'') built in the imperial palace, which the ''Tang Yulin'' describes as having water-powered fan wheels for air conditioning as well as rising jet streams of water from fountains.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 134 151">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 134 & 151.</ref> During the subsequent Song Dynasty, written sources mentioned the air conditioning rotary fan as even more widely used.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 151">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 151.</ref>

==Historiography==
{{main|Chinese historiography}}
The first classic work about the Tang is the ''[[Book of Tang]]'' by Liu Xu (887&ndash;946) et al. of the [[Later Jin Dynasty (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin]], who redacted it during the last years of his life. This was edited into another history (labelled the ''[[New Book of Tang]]'') in order to distinguish it, which was a work by the Song historians [[Ouyang Xiu]] (1007&ndash;1072), Song Qi (998&ndash;1061), et al. of the Song Dynasty (between the years 1044 and 1060). Both of them were based upon earlier annals, yet those are now lost.<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://gias.snu.ac.kr/wthong/publication/paekche/eng/chronicles.pdf Chronicles of the Chinese Dynasties]|25.9&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- pdf, 26596 bytes -->}})</ref> Both of them also rank among the ''[[Twenty-Four Histories]]'' of China. One of the surviving sources of the ''Book of Tang'', primarily covering up to 756, is the ''[[Tongdian]]'', which [[Du You]] presented to the emperor in 801. The Tang period was again placed into the enormous [[universal history]] text of the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', edited, compiled, and completed in 1084 by a team of scholars under the Song Dynasty Chancellor [[Sima Guang]] (1019&ndash;1086). This historical text, written with 3 million [[Chinese characters]] in 294 volumes, covered the history of China from the beginning of the [[Warring States]] (403 BC) until the beginning of the Song Dynasty (960).
