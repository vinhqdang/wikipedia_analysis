==Early life==

After being [[military discharge|discharged]] from the [[military]] in 1957, Willis's [[father]] took his family back to [[Penns Grove, New Jersey]], where he worked as a [[welder]] and factory worker.<ref name="AskMen">{{cite web | title=AskMen.com | work=Bruce Willis | url=http://www.askmen.com/men/entertainment/45c_bruce_willis.html | accessdate=June 21 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> His parents separated in 1971 while Willis was in his early teens.<ref name="DailyM"/> He was always an outgoing youngster, although he grew up with a [[stuttering|stutter]].<ref name="BWillisUncut">{{cite web|title=Reader's Digest|work=Bruce Willis: The Uncut Interview| url=http://www.rd.com/images/content/021102/bruce_willis_interview.pdf| accessdate=June 23|accessyear=2007}}</ref> Finding it easy to express himself on [[stage]] and losing his stutter in the process, Willis began performing on stage and his [[high school]] memberships were marked by such things as the drama club and school council [[president]].<ref name="DigitalH">{{cite web|title=Digital Hit|work=Bruce Willis|url=http://www.digitalhit.com/cr/brucewillis|accessdate=June 20|accessyear=2007}}</ref>

Rather than go to [[college]] after [[graduation]], Willis farmed [[sheep]] in a mining village in [[Alabama]], transporting work crews at the [[DuPont]] Chambers Works factory in [[Deepwater, New Jersey]]. He decided to quit after a colleague was killed on the job, and thereafter became a regular at several bars, Willis also discovered an innate knack for playing [[harmonica]] and joined a [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] [[band (music)|band]] called Loose Goose.<ref name="DigitalH"/> After a stint as a [[private investigator]] (a role he plays in his [[1991 in film|1991]] film, ''[[The Last Boy Scout]]''), Willis returned to his original passion of acting. He enrolled in the drama program at [[Montclair State University]], where he was cast in the class production of ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' with [[Jack Prince]] as Big Daddy, [[William Applegate]] as the doctor, and [[Kevin J. Lynch]] as the Rev. Tooker. The ambitious junior finally decided to leave school in pursuit of more movie roles by heading for [[New York City]].<ref name="DailyM"/>

Willis returned to the bar scene, only this time for a part-time job and as a way to meet New York [[celebrity|celebrities]]. He is rumored to have been <nowiki>'</nowiki>discovered<nowiki>'</nowiki> while working at the Museum Cafe on New York's Upper West Side. After countless [[audition]]s, Willis made his theater debut in the [[off-Broadway]] production of ''Heaven and Earth''. He gained more experience and exposure in ''[[Fool for Love]]'', a stint on [[television]]'s ''[[Miami Vice]]'', and in a [[Levi's]] [[commercial]].<ref name="YahooM"/><!-- <ref>Commercial is shown at the end of the clip http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8bytZyUNyE</ref> -->

==Career==
Willis left New York City and headed to [[California]] to audition for several television shows.<ref name="DailyM"/> He auditioned for the [[Television program|TV series]] ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]'' (1985&ndash;89), while competing against 3,000 other actors for the position and was selected to play David Addison Jr.<ref name="YahooM">{{cite web | title=Yahoo! Movies|work= Bruce Willis Biography|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800018749/bio | accessdate=June 21|accessyear=2007}}</ref> The starring role helped to establish him as a [[comedy|comedic]] actor, with the show lasting five seasons.  During the height of the show's success, alcoholic beverage maker [[Seagram]] hired Willis as the pitchman for their Golden Wine Cooler products.  The memorable ad campaign paid the rising star between five and seven million dollars over two years. In spite of that, Willis decided not renew his contract with the company when he decided to stop drinking in 1988.<ref name="Playboy">{{Citation |last=Grobel|first=Lawrence|title=Playboy Interview: Bruce Willis|newspaper=Playboy|pages=59-79|year=1988|date=November 1988|accessdate=June 27}}</ref>

However, it was his then-unexpected turn in the film ''[[Die Hard]]'' that catapulted him to fame. He performed all of his own [[stunt]]s in the film,<ref name="People1">{{cite web | title=People.com | work=Bruce Willis: Biography

He also provided his voice for a talking baby in ''[[Look Who's Talking]]'' and its sequel.

In the late-1980s, Willis enjoyed moderate success as a [[recording artist]], recording an album of pop-blues entitled ''The Return of Bruno'', which included the hit single "Respect Yourself",<ref name="TopSongs">{{cite web | title=The Eighties Club|work=Top 100 Songs of 1987|url=http://eightiesclub.tripod.com/id224.htm | accessdate=June 23|accessyear=2007}}</ref> promoted by a [[Spinal Tap]]-like [[rockumentary]] [[parody]] featuring scenes of him performing at famous events including [[Woodstock]]. Follow-up recordings were not as successful, though Willis has returned to the recording studio several times.

:<blockquote>"Organized [[religion]]s in general, in my opinion, are dying forms", he says. "They were all very important when we didn't know why the [[sun]] moved, why [[weather]] changed, why [[hurricane]]s occurred, or [[volcano]]es happened", he continues. "Modern religion is the end trail of modern [[mythology]]. But there are people who interpret the [[Bible]] literally. Literally!" he says incredulously. "I choose not to believe that's the way.

In February 2006, Willis appeared in Manhattan to talk about his new movie ''[[16 Blocks]]'' with reporters. One reporter attempted to ask Willis about his opinion on current events but was interrupted by Willis in mid-sentence:

:<blockquote>"I'm sick of answering this fucking question. I'm a Republican only as far as I want a smaller government, I want less government intrusion. I want them to stop shitting on my money and your money and tax dollars that we give 50 percent of... every year.

:<blockquote>"Everyone has a right to bear arms. If you take guns away from legal gun owners, then the only people who have guns are the bad guys."

Willis has also bashed the media for its coverage of the war, complaining that the press were more likely to focus on the negative aspects of the war: <blockquote>"...I went to Iraq because what I saw when I was over there was soldiers &mdash; young kids for the most part &mdash; helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get hospitals open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news.

===Conspiracy theories===
In a [[July 2006]] interview with [[Alex Jones (radio)|Alex Jones]], film director [[Richard Linklater]] -- who believes that the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] were perpetrated by the United States government to erect a [[police state]] -- said he gave one of Jones's documentaries to Willis. Linklater said Willis had told him in an [[e-mail]] that the video had changed his entire political paradigm. "He said it put him in such a head space that he will be quiet on issues of national policy," Linklater said.<ref name="PriPlan">{{cite web | title=Prison Planet | work=Hit Movie Director Slams Bush Administration |url=http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/july2006/120706moviedirector.htm | accessdate=June 20 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> However, [[Michael Yon]], a close friend of Willis confirmed that this was not true. After contacting him about the issue, Yon claimed:

:<blockquote>"Bruce got back to me this morning saying the press has misconstrued his statements and that this is untrue. Bruce said in part, <U+201C><U+2026>the Linklater statements have been completely misconstrued, as usual by the [[media]].<U+201D> It<U+2019>s clear that some media are just attaching Bruce<U+2019>s name to gain traction. I will not talk about private communications so will keep this very brief by saying I know Bruce<U+2019>s support for the troops is ongoing and, if anything, increasing. Bruce does not believe this conspiracy theory."<ref name="Hot Air">{{cite web | title=Hot Air | work=Yippee ki yay: Bruce Willis says he<U+2019>s not a Truther |url=http://hotair.com/archives/2006/07/14/yippee-ki-yay-bruce-willis-says-hes-not-a-truther | accessdate=June 20 | accessyear=2007}}</ref></blockquote>
