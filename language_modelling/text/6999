'''Urine''' (from [[Latin]] ''Urina'', ''ae'', ''f''.) is a [[liquid]] by-product of the body secreted by the [[kidney]]s through a process called [[urination]] and [[excreted]] through the [[urethra]].

Cellular metabolism generates numerous by-products, many rich in [[nitrogen]], that require [[clearance (medicine)|clearance]] from the [[bloodstream]]. These by-products are eventually expelled from the body during [[urination]], the primary method for excreting water-soluble chemicals from the body. These chemicals can be detected and analyzed by [[urinalysis]].

==Physiology==
{{Main|Renal physiology}}
Most animals have [[excretory system]]s for elimination of soluble toxic wastes. In humans, soluble wastes are excreted primarily by the [[urinary system]] and, to a lesser extent in terms of [[urea]] removed, by [[perspiration]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Arthur C. Guyton|author2=John Edward Hall|title=Textbook of medical physiology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sTZHAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=26 September 2011|year=2006|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|edition=11|isbn=978-0-8089-2317-6|chapter=25}}</ref> The urinary system consists of the [[kidney]]s, [[ureter]]s, [[urinary bladder]], and [[urethra]]. The system produces urine by a process of [[filtration]], [[absorption (chemistry)|reabsorption]], and tubular secretion. The kidneys extract the soluble wastes from the bloodstream, as well as excess water, sugars, and a variety of other compounds. The resulting urine contains high concentrations of [[urea]] and other substances, including toxins. Urine flows from the kidney through the ureter, bladder, and finally the urethra before passing from the body.

==Composition==
Exhaustive detailed description of the composition of human urine can be found in NASA Contractor Report No. NASA CR-1802, D. F. Putnam, July 1971.<ref>David F. Putnam [http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19710023044_1971023044.pdf Composition and Concentrative Properties of Human Urine]. NASA Contractor Report. July 1971</ref> That report provided detailed chemical analyses for inorganic and organic constituents, methods of analysis, chemical and physical properties and its behavior during concentrative processes such as evaporation, distillation and other physiochemical operations. Urine is an aqueous solution of greater than 95% water, with the remaining constituents, in order of decreasing concentration [[urea]] 9.3 g/L, [[chloride]] 1.87 g/L, [[sodium]] 1.17 g/L, [[potassium]] 0.750 g/L, [[creatinine]] 0.670 g/L and other dissolved ions, inorganic and organic compounds.

Urine is [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] until it reaches the urethra, where [[Epithelium|epithelial cells]] lining the urethra are colonized by [[Facultative anaerobic organism|facultatively anaerobic]] [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram negative rods and cocci]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Michael T.

==Hazards==
Healthy urine is not toxic.<ref>[http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/psychology/health_psychology/Urine_Therapy.htm Urine therapy]. Vanderbilt.edu (1992-10-16). Retrieved on 2011-04-27.</ref> However, it contains compounds eliminated by the body as undesirable, and can be irritating to skin and eyes. After suitable processing it is possible to extract [[potable water]] from urine.

==Characteristics==

===Chemical analysis===
{{Main|Urinalysis}}
Urine is principally water.  It also contains an assortment of inorganic salts and organic compounds, including proteins, hormones, and a wide range of metabolites, varying by what is introduced into the body.

[[File:IMAG0466.jpg|thumb|Green urine during long term infusion of the sedative [[propofol]]]]

===Color===
Urine varies in appearance, depending principally upon a body's level of [[tissue hydration|hydration]], as well as other factors. Normal urine is a transparent solution ranging from colorless to amber but is usually a pale yellow. In the urine of a healthy individual the color comes primarily from the presence of [[urobilin]]. Urobilin in turn is a final waste product resulting from the breakdown of [[heme]] from [[hemoglobin]] during the destruction of aging blood cells.

Colorless urine indicates over-hydration, generally preferable to dehydration (though it can remove essential salts from the body). Colorless urine in drug tests can suggest an attempt to avoid detection of illicit drugs in the bloodstream through over-hydration.

* Dark yellow urine is often indicative of dehydration.
* Yellowing/light orange may be caused by removal of excess [[B vitamin]]s from the bloodstream.
* Certain medications such as [[rifampin]] and [[phenazopyridine]] can cause orange urine.
* Bloody urine is termed [[hematuria]], a symptom of a wide variety of medical conditions.
* Dark orange to brown urine can be a symptom of [[jaundice]], [[rhabdomyolysis]], or [[Gilbert's syndrome]].
* Black or dark-colored urine is referred to as melanuria and may be caused by a [[melanoma]].
* Pinkish urine can result from the consumption of [[beet]]s.
* Greenish urine can result from the consumption of [[asparagus]].
* Reddish or brown urine may be caused by [[porphyria]] (not to be confused with the harmless, temporary pink or reddish tint caused by [[beeturia]]).
* Blue urine can be caused by the ingestion of [[methylene blue]] (e.g., in medications).
* Blue urine stains can be caused by [[blue diaper syndrome]].
* Purple urine may be due to [[purple urine bag syndrome]].

===Odor===
The odor of normal human urine can reflect what has been consumed or specific diseases. For example, an individual with diabetes mellitus may present a sweetened urine odor. This can be due to kidney diseases as well, such as kidney stones.

Eating asparagus can cause a strong odor reminiscent of the vegetable caused by the body's breakdown of [[asparagusic acid]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lison M, Blondheim SH, Melmed RN | title = A polymorphism of the ability to smell urinary metabolites of asparagus | journal = Br Med J | volume = 281 | issue = 6256 | pages = 1676<U+2013>8 | year = 1980 | pmid = 7448566 | pmc = 1715705 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.281.6256.1676 }}</ref> Likewise consumption of [[saffron]], [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[coffee]], [[tuna fish]], and [[onion]] can result in telltale scents.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Particularly spicy foods can have a similar effect, as their compounds pass through the kidneys without being fully broken down before exiting the body.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Stefan Gates|author2=Max La Riviere-Hedrick|title=Gastronaut: adventures in food for the romantic, the foolhardy, and the brave|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dlSXXguGw9UC&pg=PA87|accessdate=27 April 2011|date=15 March 2006|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-15-603097-7|pages=87<U+2013>}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110713222322/http://www.livestrong.com/article/248141-foods-that-affect-the-odor-of-urine/ Foods that Affect the Odor of Urine].

===Volume===
Average urine production in adult humans is about 1 <U+2013> 2 L per day, depending on state of hydration, activity level, environmental factors, weight, and the individual's health. Producing too much or too little urine needs medical attention. [[Polyuria]] is a condition of excessive production of urine (> 2.5 L/day), [[oliguria]] when < 400 mL are produced, and [[anuria]] one of < 100 mL per day.

===Density or specific gravity===
Normal urine density or [[specific gravity]] values vary between 1.003<U+2013>1.035 (g<U+00B7>cm<sup><U+2212>3</sup>), and any deviations may be associated with urinary disorders.

==Urine in medicine==

===Examination===
Many physicians in ancient history have resorted to the inspection and examination of the urine of their patients. [[Hermogenes (philosopher)|Hermogenes]] wrote about the color and other attributes of urine as indicators of certain diseases. Abdul Malik Ibn Habib of [[Andalusia]] d.862 AD, mentions numerous reports of urine examination throughout the [[Umayyad]] empire.<ref>Ibn Habib, Abdul Malik d.862CE/283AH "Kitaab Tib Al'Arab" (The Book of Arabian Medicine), Published by Dar Ibn Hazm, Beirut, Lebanon 2007(Arabic)</ref> [[Diabetes mellitus]] got its name because the urine is plentiful and sweet. A [[urinalysis]] is a medical examination of the urine and part of routine examinations. A culture of the urine is performed when a [[urinary tract infection]] is suspected. A microscopic examination of the urine may be helpful to identify organic or inorganic substrates and help in the diagnosis.

The color and volume of urine can be reliable indicators of [[rehydration|hydration]] level. Clear and copious urine is generally a sign of adequate hydration. Dark urine is a sign of [[dehydration]]. The exception occurs when [[diuretics]] or excessive amounts of [[alcohol]]{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} or [[caffeine]]{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} are consumed, in which case urine can be clear and copious and the person still be dehydrated.

===Source of Medications===
Urine contains proteins and other substances that are useful for medical therapy and are ingredients in many prescription drugs (e.g., Ureacin, [[Urecholine]], Urowave).{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Urine from [[menopause|postmenopausal]] women is rich in [[gonadotropin]]s that can yield [[follicle stimulating hormone]] and [[luteinizing hormone]] for fertility therapy.<ref name="books.google.ca">[http://books.google.ca/books?id=lcBEheiufVcC&pg=PA489&lpg=PA489&dq=urine-derived+gonadotropins&source=bl&ots=bcwNoc6zP3&sig=5rt-D-RU9ipfKL3dvGbUHz9VWY0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=6odTUYWFB-eY2AXT7IHoCA&sqi=2&ved=0CFkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=urine-derived%20gonadotropins&f=false Carrell, D.T., & Peterson, C.

===Agriculture===
{{Main| Fertilizer}}
Urine contains large quantities of nitrogen (mostly as [[urea]]), as well as significant quantities of dissolved phosphates and potassium, the main [[macronutrients]] required by plants, with urine having plant macronutrient percentages (''i.e.'' [[NPK]]) of approximately 11-1-2 by one study<ref name=Wolgast>{{cite web|last=Wolgast|first=M|title=Rena vatten.

The more general limitations to using urine as fertilizer then depend mainly on the potential for buildup of excess nitrogen (due to the high ratio of that macronutrient),<ref name="Morgan" /> and inorganic [[salt]]s such as [[sodium chloride]], which are also part of the wastes excreted by the [[renal system]]. The degree to which these factors impact the effectiveness depends on the term of use, salinity tolerance of the plant, soil composition, addition of other fertilizing compounds, and quantity of rainfall or other irrigation.

Urine can also be used safely as a source of complementary nitrogen in carbon-rich [[compost]].<ref name="LiquidGold">{{cite book | url = http://www.liquidgoldbook.com/ | title = Liquid Gold: The Lore and Logic of Using Urine to Grow Plants | last = Steinfeld | first = Carol | publisher = Ecowaters Books | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-9666783-1-4 }}</ref>

Urine typically contains 70% of the [[nitrogen]] and more than half the [[phosphorus]] and [[potassium]] found in urban waste water flows, while making up less than 1% of the overall volume. Human urine can be collected with [[sanitation]] systems that utilise [[urinals]] or [[urine diversion]] toilets. Thus far, source separation, or [[urine diversion]] systems have been implemented in South Africa, China, Sweden and many other countries. Since about 2011, the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] is providing research funding sanitation systems that recover the nutrients in urine.<ref>[http://www.sanitationfinance.org/blog/urine-fertilizer-south-africa South African city looks to turn urine into fertilizer, UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, November 2010].

"Urine management" is a relatively new way of closing the cycle of agricultural nutrient flows (also called ecological sanitation or [[ecosan]]) and - possibly - reducing sewage treatment costs and ecological consequences such as [[eutrophication]] resulting from the influx of nutrient rich effluent into aquatic or marine ecosystems.<ref name="Ganrot" /> The risks of using urine as a natural source of agricultural fertilizer are generally regarded as negligible or acceptable. In fact, some research has shown that there are more environmental problems when urine is treated (as part of [[sewage]] in [[wastewater treatment plants]]) and disposed of compared with when it is used as a resource.<ref>[http://ecosanservices.org/pdf/UDD-ToiletsTraining%20material.pdf UDD-Toilets and urine management].

It is unclear whether source separation, [[urine diversion]], and on-site urine treatment can be made cost effective; nor whether required behavioral changes would be regarded as socially acceptable, as the largely successful trials performed in Sweden may not readily generalize to other industrialized societies.<ref name="UrineSeparation" /> In developing countries the use of whole raw sewage ([[night soil]]) has been common throughout history, yet the application of pure urine to crops is rare. Increasingly there are calls for urine's use as a fertilizer, such as a ''Scientific American'' article "Human urine is an effective fertilizer".<ref>Mara Grunbaum [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=human-urine-is-an-effective-fertilizer Human urine is shown to be an effective agricultural fertilizer], Scientific American, July 2010. Retrieved on 2011-12-07.</ref>

If urine is to be collected for use as a fertiliser in agriculture, then the easiest method of doing so is (in increasing order of costs) by using waterless [[urinals]], [[Urine-diverting dry toilets|urine-diverting dry toilets (UDDTs)]] or [[urine diversion]] flush toilets.<ref name=":0">von M<U+00FC>nch, E., Winker, M.

===Cleaning===
Due to the fact that urea in urine breaks down into ammonia, urine has been used for the cleaning properties of the ammonia therein. In pre-industrial times urine was used <U+2013> in the form of ''lant'' or aged urine <U+2013> as a cleaning fluid.<ref>Sueton, Vespasian 23 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html#23 English], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html#23 Latin].

===Gunpowder===
{{Main|Potassium nitrate}}
Urine was used before the development of a [[chemical industry]] in the manufacture of [[gunpowder]]. Urine, a nitrogen source, was used to moisten straw or other organic material, which was kept moist and allowed to rot for several months to over a year. The resulting [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] were washed from the heap with water, which was evaporated to allow collection of crude saltpeter crystals, that were usually refined before being used in making gunpowder.<ref name="LeConte"><!-- this ref is also used in the potassium nitrate article -->

===Survival uses===
{{See also|Urophagia}}
The ''[[US Army Field Manual]]'',<ref>[http://www.equipped.com/21-76/ch6.pdf Water Procurement], US Army Field Manual</ref> advises ''against'' drinking urine for survival. These guides explain that drinking urine tends to worsen, rather than relieve dehydration due to the salts in it, and that urine should not be consumed in a survival situation, even when there is no other fluid available. In hot weather survival situations where other sources of water are not available, soaking cloth (a shirt for example) in urine and putting it on the head can help cool the body.

During [[World War I]] the [[Germans]] experimented with numerous poisonous gases for use during war. After the first German [[chlorine]] gas attacks, Allied troops were supplied with masks of cotton pads that had been soaked in urine. It was believed that the [[ammonia]] in the pad neutralized the chlorine. These pads were held over the face until the soldiers could escape from the poisonous fumes, although it is now known that chlorine gas reacts with urine to produce [[Chloramine|toxic fumes]] (''see [[chlorine]] and [[use of poison gas in World War I]]'').{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The [[Vickers machine gun]], used by the British Army during World War 1, required water for cooling when fired so soldiers would resort to urine if water was unavailable.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.royalarmouries.org/what-we-do/research/nfc/single-object/172 | title=Vickers Mk.I machine gun | publisher=[[Royal Armouries]] | accessdate=September 26, 2012}}</ref>

===Tanning===
{{Main|Tanning}}
Tanners soaked animal skins in urine to remove hair fibers<U+2014>a necessary step in the preparation of leather.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Textiles===
Urine has often been used as a [[mordant]] to help prepare textiles, especially wool, for dyeing. In the Scottish Highlands and Hebrides, the process of "[[waulking]]" (fulling) woven wool is preceded by soaking in urine, preferably infantile.<ref>Mentioned by an interviewee in ''[[Lomax the Songhunter]]'', a 2004 documentary film.</ref>

==History and language==
Prior to the acquisition of [[soap]] from the [[Germanic peoples]] during the first century AD, [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]] used fermented human urine (in the form of lant) to cleanse grease stains from clothing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/weekly/aa031303a.htm|title=Hygiene in Ancient Rome|accessdate=2010-02-09|work=}}</ref> The emperor [[Nero]] instituted a tax ({{lang-la|vectigal urinae}}) on the urine industry, continued by his successor, [[Vespasian]].  It is Vespasian to whom the Latin saying ''[[Pecunia non olet]]'' (money doesn't smell) is attributed <U+2013> said to have been the emperor's reply to a complaint from his [[Titus|son]] about the unpleasant nature of the tax. Vespasian's name is still attached to public [[urinal (restroom)|urinal]]s in France (''vespasiennes''), Italy (''vespasiani''), and Romania (''vespasiene'').

[[Alchemy|Alchemists]] spent much time trying to extract gold from urine, which led to discoveries such as [[white phosphorus]] by German alchemist [[Hennig Brand]] when  distilling [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermented]] urine in 1669. In 1773 the French chemist [[Hilaire Rouelle]] discovered the organic compound [[urea]] by boiling urine dry.

The [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoetic]] term "piss" was the usual word for urination prior to the 14th century. "Urinate" was at first used mostly in medical contexts. "Piss" continues to be used, but is considered vulgar; it is also used in such colloquialisms as "to piss off" and "piss poor". [[Euphemism]]s and expressions used between parents and children such as "wee", "pee", and many others, arose.

In [[Classical Latin]] (not necessarily in medical Latin) the verb ''urinari'' meant "to dive", not "to urinate". The Classical Latin for "I urinate" is "m<U+0113>i<U+014D>".
