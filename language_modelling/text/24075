{{Nihongo3||[[wikt:<U+592A><U+9F13>|<U+592A><U+9F13>]]|'''Taiko'''}} are a broad range of [[Traditional Japanese musical instruments|Japanese]] [[percussion]] instruments. In Japanese, the term refers to any kind of drum, but outside Japan, it is used to refer to any of the various Japanese drums called {{nihongo4|''wadaiko''|<U+548C><U+592A><U+9F13>|"Japanese drums"}} and to the form of ensemble taiko drumming more specifically called {{nihongo4|''kumi-daiko''|<U+7D44><U+592A><U+9F13>|"set of drums"}}. The process of constructing taiko varies between manufacturers, and preparation of both the drum body and skin can take several years depending on methodology.

Taiko have a mythological origin in [[Japanese folklore]], but historical records suggest that taiko were introduced to Japan through Korean and Chinese cultural influence as early as the 6th century CE. Some taiko are similar to instruments originating from India. Archeological evidence also supports that taiko were present in Japan during the 6th century in the [[Kofun period]]. Their function has varied through history, ranging from communication, military action, theatrical accompaniment, religious ceremony, and both festival and concert performances. In contemporary times, taiko have also played a central role in social movements for minorities both within and outside Japan.

''Kumi-daiko'' performance, characterized by an ensemble playing on different drums, was developed in 1951 through the work of [[Daihachi Oguchi]] and has continued with groups such as [[Kodo (taiko group)|Kodo]]. Other performance styles, such as ''hachij<U+014D>-daiko'', have also emerged from specific communities in Japan. ''Kumi-daiko'' performance groups are active not only in Japan, but also in the United States, Australia, Canada, and Brazil. Taiko performance consists of many components in technical rhythm, [[kata|form]], [[drum stick|stick]] grip, clothing, and the [[instrumentation (music)|particular instrumentation]]. Ensembles typically use different types of barrel-shaped ''nagad<U+014D>-daiko'' as well as smaller ''shime-daiko''. Many groups accompany the drums with vocals, strings, and woodwind instruments.

==History==

===Origin===
[[File:ThreeHaniwa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Haniwa]], dated to the 6th century CE.  The left and right depict two drum performers.  The statue on the left, depicted using a stick on a barrel-shaped drum, represents the earliest evidence of taiko usage in Japan.|alt=Three clay figures called haniwa, two of which depict figures playing drums.]]
The origin of the instruments is unclear, though there have been many suggestions. Historical accounts, of which the earliest date from 588&nbsp;CE, note that young Japanese men traveled to Korea to study the [[Kakko (instrument)|kakko]], a drum that originated in [[South China]]. This study and appropriation of Chinese instruments may have influenced the emergence of taiko.{{sfn|Blades|1992|pp=122<U+2013>123}} Certain court music styles, especially [[gigaku]] and [[gagaku]], arrived in Japan through both Korea and China.{{sfn|Nelson|2007||pp=36, 39}}{{sfn|Schuller|1989|p=202}} In both traditions, dancers were accompanied by several instruments that included drums similar to taiko.{{sfn|Schuller|1989|p=202}}{{sfn|Coss<U+00ED>o|2001|p=179}} Certain percussive patterns and terminology in [[togaku]], an early dance and music style in Japan, in addition to physical features of the kakko, also reflect influence from both China and India on drum use in gagaku performance.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=26}}{{sfn|Harich-Schneider|1973|pp=108, 110}}

Archeological evidence shows that taiko were used in Japan as early as the 6th century CE,<ref name=TNM>{{cite web|title=Music Festival at the Museum|url=http://www.tnm.jp/modules/r_free_page/index.php?id=684|publisher=Tokyo National Museum|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref> during the latter part of the [[Kofun period]], and were likely used for communication and in festivals and other rituals.{{sfn|Dean|2012|p=122}} This evidence was substantiated by the discovery of [[haniwa]] statues in the [[Sawa District, Gunma|Sawa District]] of [[Gunma Prefecture]]. Two of these figures are depicted playing drums;{{sfn|Dean|2012|p=122}} one of them, wearing skins, is equipped with a barrel-shaped drum hung from his shoulder and uses a stick to play the drum at hip height.{{sfnm|Dean|2012|1p=122|Varian|2013|2p=21}}<ref name=Ochi>{{cite web|last1=Ochi|first1=Megumi|title=What The Haniwa Have to Say About Taiko's Roots: The History of Taiko|url=http://www.taiko.com/taiko_resource/history/haniwa_ochi.html|publisher=Rolling Thunder|accessdate=27 December 2014}}</ref> This statue is titled "Man Beating the Taiko" and is considered the oldest evidence of taiko performance in Japan.<ref name=Ochi />{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=21}} Similarities between the playing style demonstrated by this haniwa and known music traditions in Korea and China further suggest influences from these regions.{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=21}}

The ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', the second oldest book of Japanese classical history, contains a mythological story describing the origin of taiko.  The myth tells how [[Amaterasu]], who had sealed herself inside a cave in anger, was beckoned out by an elder goddess [[Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto|Ame-no-Uzume]] when others had failed.  Ame-no-Uzume accomplished this by emptying out a barrel of [[sake]] and dancing furiously on top of it.  Historians regard her performance as the mythological creation of taiko music.{{sfnm|Minor|2003|1pp=37<U+2013>39|Izumi|2001|2pp=37<U+2013>39|Raz|3y=1983|3p=19}}

===Use in warfare===
[[File:Adolfo Farsari - Dancing Girl Playing Taiko.JPG|thumb|right|Hand-colored print of a woman playing a ''shime-daiko'', circa 1885|alt=refer to caption]]
In feudal Japan, taiko were often used to motivate troops, call out orders or announcements, and set a marching pace; marches were usually set to six paces per beat of the drum.{{sfn|Turnbull|2008|p=37}}{{sfn|Turnbull|2012|pp=27<U+2013>28}} During the 16th-century [[Sengoku period|Warring States period]], specific drum calls were used to communicate orders for retreating and advancing.{{sfn|Turnbull|2012|p=27}} Other rhythms and techniques were detailed in period texts. According to the war chronicle ''Gunji Yosh<U+016B>'', nine sets of five beats would summon an ally to battle, while nine sets of three beats, sped up three or four times, was the call to advance and pursue an enemy.{{sfn|Turnbull|2008|p=49}} Folklore from the 16th century on the legendary 6th-century [[Emperor Keitai]] offers a story that he obtained a large drum from China, which he named {{nihongo4|''Senjin-daiko''|<U+7DDA><U+9663><U+592A><U+9F13>|"front drum"}}.{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=12}} The Emperor was thought to have used it to both encourage his own army and intimidate his enemies.{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=12}}

===In traditional settings===
Taiko have been incorporated in Japanese theater for rhythmic needs, general atmosphere, and in certain settings decoration. In the kabuki play ''The Tale of Shiroishi and the Taihei Chronicles'', scenes in the [[Y<U+016B>kaku|pleasure quarters]] are accompanied by taiko to create dramatic tension.{{sfn|Brandon|Leiter|2002|p=86}} [[Noh]] theater also feature taiko{{sfn|Miki|2008|p=176}}{{sfn|Malm|2000|pp=286-288}} where performance consists of highly specific rhythmic patterns. The {{nihongo4|''Konparu''|<U+91D1><U+6625><U+6D41>}} school of drumming, for example, contains 65 basic patterns in addition to 25 special patterns; these patterns are categorized in several classes.{{sfn|Malm|1960|pp=75<U+2013>78}} Differences between these patterns include changes in [[tempo]], [[accent (music)|accent]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[pitch (music)|pitch]], and function in the theatrical performance. Patterns are also often connected together in progressions.{{sfn|Malm|1960|pp=75<U+2013>78}}

Taiko continue to be used in a classical music tradition, gagaku, typically performed at the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace]] in addition to local temples and shrines.{{sfn|Malm|2000|pp=101-102}} In gagaku, one component of the art form is traditional dance, which is guided in part by the rhythm set by the taiko.{{sfn|Malm|2000|pp=103}}  Taiko have played an important role in many local festivals across Japan.<ref name=JANM>{{cite web|title=Kenny Endo: Connecting to Heritage through Music|url=http://www.janm.org/exhibits/bigdrum/interviews/endo.php|work=Big Drum|publisher=[[Japanese American National Museum]]|accessdate=7 November 2013}}</ref> They are also used to accompany religious ritual music. In [[kagura]], which generically describes music and dances stemming from [[Shinto]] practices, taiko frequently appear alongside other performers during local festivals.  In Buddhist traditions, taiko are used for ritual dances that are a part of the [[Bon Festival]].{{sfn|Miki|2008|p=180}}{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=110}} Taiko, along with other instruments, are featured atop towers that are adorned with red-and-white cloth and serve to provide rhythms for the dancers who are encircled around the performers.{{sfn|Malm|2000|p=77}}

===Kumi-daiko===

[[File:TaikoDrummersAichiJapan.jpg|thumb|left|A ''kumi-daiko'' group performing in [[Aichi, Japan]] wearing [[hachimaki]]|alt=refer to caption]]
In addition to the instruments, the term ''taiko'' also refers to the performance itself,{{sfn|Konagaya|2005|p=134}}{{sfn|Ingram|2004|p=71}} and commonly to one style called ''kumi-daiko'', or ensemble-style playing (as opposed to festival performances, rituals, or theatrical use of the drums).{{sfn|Miller|Shahriari|2014|p=146}}{{sfn|Powell 2012a}} ''Kumi-daiko'' was developed by [[Daihachi Oguchi]] in 1951.{{sfn|Miller|Shahriari|2014|p=146}}{{sfn|Varian|2005|p=33}} He is considered a master performer and helped transform taiko performance from its roots in traditional settings in festivals and shrines.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|title=Daihachi Oguchi, 84, Japanese Drummer, Dies|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/28/arts/music/28oguchi.html?_r=0|accessdate=21 August 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=28 June 2008|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> Oguchi was trained as a jazz musician in [[Nagano]], and at one point, a relative gave him an old piece of written taiko music.{{sfn|Alves|2012|p=312}} Unable to read the traditional and esoteric notation,{{sfn|Alves|2012|p=312}} Oguchi found help to transcribe the piece, and on his own added rhythms and transformed the work to accommodate multiple taiko players on different-sized instruments.{{sfn|Varian|2005|p=28}} Each instrument served a specific purpose that established present-day conventions in ''kumi-daiko'' performance.{{sfn|Varian|2005|p=29}}{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=51}}

Oguchi's ensemble, [[Osuwa Daiko]], incorporated these alterations and other drums into their performances. They also devised novel pieces that were intended for non-religious performances.{{sfn|Alves|2012|p=312}} Several other groups emerged in Japan through the 1950s and 1960s. [[Oedo Sukeroku Daiko]] was formed in [[Tokyo]] in 1959 under [[Seid<U+014D> Kobayashi]],{{sfn|Powell 2012b|p=125}} and has been referred to as the first taiko group who toured professionally.{{sfn|Wong|2004|p=204}} Globally, ''kumi-daiko'' performance became more visible during the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in Tokyo, when it was featured during the Festival of Arts event.{{sfn|Varian|2005|pp=28<U+2013>29}}

''Kumi-daiko'' was also developed through the leadership of {{nihongo4|[[Den Tagayasu]]|<U+7530><U+8015>|Den Tagayasu}}, who gathered young men who were willing to devote their entire lifestyle to taiko playing and took them to [[Sado Island]] for training{{sfn|Varian|2005|p = 29}}{{sfn|Wald|Vartoogian|2007|p=251}} where Den and his family had settled in 1968.{{sfn|Konagaya|2005|p=65}} Den chose the island based on a desire to reinvigorate the folk arts in Japan, particularly taiko; he became inspired by a drumming tradition unique to Sado called {{nihongo4|''ondeko''|<U+9B3C><U+592A><U+9F13>|"demon drumming" in Sado dialect}} that required considerable strength to play well.{{sfn|Konagaya|2005|pp=64<U+2013>65}} Den called the group "Za Ondekoza" or [[Ondekoza]] for short, and implemented a rigorous set of exercises including long-distance running.{{sfn|Varian|2005|p=28}}{{sfn|Wald|Vartoogian|2007|p=251}} In 1975, Ondekoza was the first taiko group to tour in the United States.

Taiko have been developed into a broad range of [[percussion instrument]]s that are used in both [[Music of Japan|Japanese folk and classical]] musical traditions. An early classification system based on shape and tension was advanced by [[Francis Taylor Piggott]] in 1909.{{sfn|Piggott|1971|pp=191<U+2013>203}} Taiko are generally classified based on the construction process, or the specific context in which the drum is used,{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=12}} but some are not classified, such as the toy [[den-den daiko]].{{sfn|Kakehi|Tamori|Schourup|1996|p=251}}

With few exceptions, taiko have a drum shell with heads on both sides of the body, and a sealed resonating cavity.{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=12}} The head may be fastened to the shell using a number of different systems, such as using ropes.{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=12}} Taiko may be either tunable or non-tunable depending on the system used.{{sfn|Tusler|2003|p=60}}

Taiko are categorized into three types based on construction process. ''By<U+014D>-uchi-daiko'' are constructed with the [[drumhead]] nailed to the body.{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=12}} ''Shime-daiko'' are classically constructed with the skin placed over iron or steel rings, which are then tightened with ropes.{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=57}} Contemporary ''shime-daiko'' are tensioned using  [[Screw|bolts]] or [[turnbuckle]]s systems attached to the drum body.{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=12}}{{sfn|Miki|2008|p=177}}  ''Tsuzumi'' are also rope-tensioned drums, but have a distinct hourglass shape and their skins are made using deerskin.{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=57}}

''By<U+014D>-uchi-daiko'' were historically made only using a single piece of wood;{{sfn|Carlsen|2009|pp=130<U+2013>131}} they continue to be made in this manner, but are also constructed from staves of wood.{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=12}}  Larger drums can be made using a single piece of wood, but at a much greater cost due to the difficulty in finding appropriate trees.{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=12}} The preferred wood is the [[Zelkova serrata|Japanese zelkova]] or ''keyaki'',{{sfn|Ammer|2004|p=420}} but a number of other woods, and even [[wine barrel]]s, have been used to create taiko.{{sfn|Ammer|2004|p=420}}<ref name=Liu /> ''By<U+014D>-uchi-daiko'' cannot be tuned.{{sfn|Tusler|2003|p=60}}

The typical ''by<U+014D>-uchi-daiko'' is the ''nagad<U+014D>-daiko'',<ref name=Shumei2>{{cite web|title=Drums and Other Instruments|url=http://www.shumeitaiko.org/drums.html|publisher=The Shumei Taiko Ensemble|accessdate=26 February 2015}}</ref> an elongated drum that is roughly shaped like a wine barrel.{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=55}} ''Nagad<U+014D>-daiko'' are available in a variety of sizes, and their head diameter is traditionally measured in [[shaku (unit)|shaku]] (units of roughly 30&nbsp;cm).

[[Shime-daiko]] are a set of smaller, roughly-[[snare drum]] sized instrument that are tunable.{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=57}} The tensioning system usually consists of hemp cords or rope, but bolt or turnbuckle systems have been used as well.{{sfn|Miki|2008|p=177}}{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=130}}  {{nihongo4|''Nagauta shime-daiko''|<U+9577><U+5504><U+7DE0><U+3081><U+592A><U+9F13>}}, sometimes referred to as "taiko" in the context of theater, have thinner heads than other kinds of shime-daiko.{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=130}}  The head includes a patch of deerskin is placed in the center, and in performance, drum strokes are generally restricted to this area.{{sfn|Miki|2008|p=177}}  The {{nihongo4|''tsukeshime-daiko''|<U+4ED8><U+3051><U+7DE0><U+3081><U+592A><U+9F13>}} is a heavier type of ''shime-daiko''.{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=57}} They are available in sizes 1<U+2013>5, and are named according to their number: ''namitsuke''&nbsp;(1), ''nich<U+014D>-gakke''&nbsp;(2), ''sanch<U+014D>-gakke''&nbsp;(3), ''yonch<U+014D>-gakke''&nbsp;(4), and ''goch<U+014D>-gakke''&nbsp;(5).{{sfn|Varian|2013|pp=119, 126}} The ''namitsuke'' has the thinnest skins and the shortest body in terms of height; thickness and tension of skins, as well as body height, increase toward the ''goch<U+014D>-gakke''.{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=119}} The head diameters of all ''shime-daiko'' sizes are around {{convert|27|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Miki|2008|p=177}}

''Oked<U+014D>-daiko'' or simply ''oked<U+014D>'', are a type of ''shime-daiko'' that are stave-constructed using narrower strips of wood,{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=12}}<ref name=JANM2>{{cite web|title=Taiko in the United States|url=http://janmstore.com/taikointheus.html|work=Taiko in the United States|publisher=Japanese American National Museum|accessdate=20 August 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20141030005957/http://janmstore.com/taikointheus.html|archivedate=30 October 2014}}</ref> have a tube-shaped frame.  Like other ''shime-daiko'', drum heads are attached by metal hoops and fastened by rope or cords.<ref name=Shumei2 />{{sfn|Miki|2008|p=181}} ''Oked<U+014D>'' can be played using the same drumsticks (called ''bachi'') as ''shime-daiko'', but can also be hand-played.{{sfn|Miki|2008|p=181}} ''Oked<U+014D>'' come in short- and long-bodied types.<ref name=Shumei2 />

''Tsuzumi'' are a class of hourglass-shaped drums.  The drum body is shaped on a spool and the inner body carved by hand.{{sfn|Blades|1992|p=126}}  Their skins can be made from cowhide, horsehide, or deerskin.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=28}}  While the ''<U+014D>-tsuzumi'' skins are made from cowhide, ''ko-tsuzumi'' are made from horsehide.  While some classify ''tsuzumi'' as a type of taiko,{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=28}}{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=57}} others have described them as a drum entirely separate from taiko.{{sfn|Blades|1992|p=124}}{{sfn|Miki|2008|p=156}}

Taiko can also be categorized by the context in which they are used. The ''miya-daiko'', for instance, is constructed in the same manner as other ''by<U+014D>-uchi-daiko'', but is distinguished by an ornamental stand and is used for ceremonial purposes at [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temples]].{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=13}}{{sfn|Yoon|2001|p=420}} The {{nihongo4|''Sum<U+014D>-daiko''|<U+76F8><U+64B2><U+592A><U+9F13>}} (a ''ko-daiko'') and {{nihongo4|''sairei-nagad<U+014D>''|<U+796D><U+793C><U+9577><U+80F4>}} (a ''nagad<U+014D>-daiko'' with a cigar-shaped body) are used in [[sumo]] and festivals respectively.{{sfn|Varian|2013|pp=129, 131}}

Several drums, categorized as ''gagakki'', are used in the Japanese theatrical form, [[gagaku]].{{sfn|Miki|2008|p=169}} The lead instrument of the ensemble is the [[kakko (instrument)|kakko]],{{sfn|Malm|2000|p=104}} which is a smaller ''shime-daiko'' with heads made of deerskin, and is placed horizontally on a stand during performance.{{sfn|Malm|2000|p=104}}  A ''tsuzumi'', called the ''san-no-tsuzumi'' is another small drum in gagaku that is placed horizontally and struck with a thin stick.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=27}} {{nihongo4|''Dadaiko''|<U+9F09><U+592A><U+9F13>}} are the largest drums of the ensemble,{{sfn|Malm|2000|p=335}} and have heads that are about {{convert|127|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter. During performance, the drum is placed on a tall pedestals and surrounded by a rim decoratively painted with flames and adorned with mystical figures such as [[wyverns]].{{sfn|Blades|1992|pp=124-125}} ''Dadaiko'' are played while standing,{{sfn|Blades|1992|pp=123}} and are usually only played on the [[Beat (music)#Downbeat|downbeat]] of the music.{{sfn|Miki|2008|p=169}} The {{nihongo4|''tsuri-daiko''|<U+91E3><U+592A><U+9F13>|"suspended drum"}} is a smaller drum that produces a lower sound, its head measuring about {{convert|55|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter.{{sfn|Miki|2008|p=171}} It is used in [[bugaku]], a traditional dance performed at the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace]] and in religious contexts.{{sfn|Blades|1992|pp=122<U+2013>123}} ''Tsuri-daiko'' are suspended on a small stand, and are played sitting down.{{sfn|Miki|2008|p=171}}  ''Tsuri-daiko'' performers typically use shorter mallets covered in leather knobs instead of [[bachi]].{{sfn|Blades|1992|pp=122<U+2013>123}} They can be played simultaneously by two performers; while one performer plays on the head, another performer uses bachi on the body of the drum.{{sfn|Blades|1992|pp=122<U+2013>123}}

The larger ''<U+014D>-tsuzumi'' and smaller ''ko-tsuzumi'' are used in the opening and dances of [[Noh theater]].{{sfn|Malm|2000|pp=137, 142}}  Both drums are struck using the fingers; players can also adjust pitch by manually applying pressure to the ropes on the drum.{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=58}} The color of the cords of these drums also indicates the skill of the musician:  Orange and red for amateur players, light blue for performers with expertise, and [[lilac (color)|lilac]] for masters of the instrument.{{sfn|Blades|1992|p=127}}  ''Nagauta-shime daiko'' or ''uta daiko'' are also featured in Noh performance.{{sfn|Blades|1992|p=125}}{{sfn|Roth|2002|p=161}}

Many taiko in Noh are also featured in [[kabuki]] performance and are used in a similar manner.{{sfn|Malm|1963|pp=74<U+2013>77}}  In addition to the ''<U+014D>-tsuzumi'', ''ko-tsuzumi'', and ''nagauta-shime daiko'',{{sfn|Malm|1963|pp=75}} Kabuki performances make use of the larger ''<U+014D>-daiko'' offstage to help set the atmosphere for different scenes.{{sfn|Brandon|Leiter|2002|pp=153,363}}

==Construction==

===Process===

Taiko construction has several stages, including making and shaping of the drum body (or shell), preparing the drum skin, and tuning the skin to the drumhead. Variations in the construction process often occur in the latter two parts of this process.{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=53}} Historically, ''by<U+014D>-uchi-daiko'' were crafted from [[trunk (botany)|trunks]] of the Japanese zelkova tree that were dried out over years, using techniques to prevent [[wood splitting|splitting]]. A master carpenter then carved out the rough shape of the drum body with a chisel; the texture of the wood after carving softened the tone of the drum.{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=53}}{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=35}} In contemporary times, taiko are carved out on a large [[lathe]] using wood staves{{sfn|Carlsen|2009|pp=130<U+2013>131}} or logs that can be shaped to fit drum bodies of various sizes.{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=54}} Drumheads can be left to air-dry over a period of years,{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=17}} but some companies use large, smoke-filled warehouses to hasten the drying process.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=35}} After drying is complete, the inside of the drum is worked with a deep-grooved chisel and sanded.{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=17}} Lastly, handles are placed onto the drum. These are used to carry smaller drums and they serve an ornamental purpose for larger drums.{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=18}}

[[File:Taiko drum manufacturing.jpg|thumb|left|Taiko drum manufacturing display in the [[Osaka Human Rights Museum]]|alt=A display at the Osaka Human Rights Museum depicting two workers, wielding large mallets, in the process of applying appropriate tension to a taiko.]]
The [[drum skin|skins]] or heads of taiko are generally made from [[cowhide]] from [[Holstein cattle|Holstein cows]] aged about three or four years. Skins also come from [[horse]]s, and [[bull]] skin is preferred for larger drums.{{sfn|Malm|1960|pp=75<U+2013>78}}{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=53}} Thinner skins are preferred for smaller taiko, and thicker skins are used for larger ones.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=36}} On some drumheads, a patch of deer skin placed in the center serves as the target for many strokes during performance.{{sfn|Malm|1960|pp=75<U+2013>78}} Before fitting it to the drum body the hair is removed from the hide by soaking it in a river or stream for about a month; winter months are preferred as colder temperatures better facilitate hair removal.{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=18}} To stretch the skin over the drum properly, one process requires the body to be held on a platform with several [[hydraulic jack]]s underneath it. The edges of the cowhide are secured to an apparatus below the jacks, and the jacks stretch the skin incrementally to precisely apply tension across the drumhead.{{sfn|Carlsen|2009|p=131}} Other forms of stretching use rope or cords with wooden [[dowel]]s or an iron wheel to create appropriate tension.{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=18}}{{sfn|Cangia|2013|p=36}} Small tension adjustments can be made during this process using small pieces of bamboo that twist around the ropes.{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=18}} After the skin has dried, tacks, called ''by<U+014D>'', are added to the appropriate drums to secure it; ''ch<U+016B>-daiko'' require about 300 of them for each side.{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=19}} After the body and skin have been finished, excess hide is cut off and the drum can be stained as needed.{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=19}}

===Drum makers===
Several companies specialize in the production of taiko.  One such company that created drums exclusively for the [[Emperor of Japan]], [[Miyamoto Unosuke Shoten]] in Tokyo, has been making taiko since 1861.{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=53}} The [[Asano Taiko Corporation]] is another major taiko-producing organization, and has been producing taiko for over 400 years.{{sfn|Bender|2012|pp=34<U+2013>35}}<ref name=Dretzka>{{cite news|last1=Dretzka|first1=Gary|last2=Caro|first2=Mark|title=How `An Alan Smithee Film' Became An Alan Smithee Film|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-03-01/news/9803010298_1_cinergi-pictures-arthur-hiller-ben-myron/2|accessdate=29 November 2014|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=1 March 1998}}</ref> The family-owned business started in [[Matt<U+014D>, Ishikawa]], and, aside from military equipment, made taiko for Noh theater and later expanded to creating instruments for festivals during the [[Meiji period]]. Asano currently maintains an entire complex of large buildings referred to as Asano Taiko Village,{{sfn|Bender|2012|pp=34<U+2013>35}} and the company reports producing up to 8000 drums each year.<ref name=AsanoCorp>{{cite web|script-title=ja:<U+682A><U+5F0F><U+4F1A><U+793E><U+6D45><U+91CE><U+592A><U+9F13><U+697D><U+5668><U+5E97>|url=http://www.asano.jp/village/profile/asanotaiko/|website=Asano.jp|publisher=Asano Taiko Corporation|accessdate=23 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109033131/http://www.asano.jp/village/profile/asanotaiko/|archivedate=9 November 2013|language=Japanese}}</ref> As of 2012, there is approximately one major taiko production company in [[Prefectures of Japan|each prefecture of Japan]], with some regions having several companies.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=38}} Of the manufacturers in Naniwa, Taikoya Matab<U+0113> is one of the most successful and is thought to have brought considerable recognition to the community and attracted many drum makers there.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=44}} Umetsu Daiko, a company that operates in [[Hakata-ku, Fukuoka|Hakata]], has been producing taiko since 1821.{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=17}}

==Performance==
Taiko performance styles vary widely across groups in terms of the number of performers, repertoire, instrument choices, and stage techniques.{{sfn|Bender|2012|pp=19, 70}} Nevertheless, a number of early groups have had broad influence on the tradition. For instance, many pieces developed by Ondekoza and Kodo are considered standard in many taiko groups.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=60}}

===Form===
[[Kata]] is a term used to describe the posture and movement associated with taiko performance.{{sfn|Powell 2012a}}{{sfn|Tusler|2003|pp=73<U+2013>74}} The term is used in martial arts in a similar way: for example, both traditions include the idea that the hara is the center of being.{{sfn|Powell 2012a}}{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=89}} Author Sean Bender argues that kata is the primary feature that distinguishes different taiko groups from one another, and is a key factor in judging the quality of performance.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=10}} For this reason, many practice rooms intended for taiko contain mirrors to provide visual feedback to players.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=122}} An important part of kata in taiko is keeping the body stabilized while performing, and can be accomplished by keeping a wide, low stance with the legs, with the left knee bent over the toes and keeping the right leg straight.{{sfn|Powell 2012a}}{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=94}} It is important for that the hips face the drum and the shoulders be relaxed.{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=94}} Some teachers note a tendency to rely on the upper body while playing, and emphasize the importance of the holistic use of the body during performance.{{sfn|Bender|2005|p=201}}

Some groups in Japan, particularly those active in Tokyo, also emphasize the importance of the lively and spirited ''[[Iki (aesthetics)|iki]]'' aesthetic.{{sfn|Bender|2005|p=58}} In taiko, it refers to very specific kinds of movement while performing that evoke the sophistication stemming from the mercantile and artisan classes active during the [[Edo period]] (1603<U+2013>1868).{{sfn|Bender|2005|p=58}}

[[File:Taikos bachi.jpg|thumb|right|''Bachi'' are sticks used specifically for taiko performance, and can be slightly thicker than typical [[drum sticks]].|alt=Different types of drum sticks for taiko, called bachi, are displayed flat on a surface.]]
The sticks for playing taiko are called ''bachi'', and are made in various sizes and from different kinds of wood such as [[Quercus alba|white oak]], [[bamboo]], and [[Japanese magnolia]].{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=59}} ''Bachi'' are also held in a number of different styles.{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=92}} In ''kumi-daiko'', it is common for a player to hold their sticks in a relaxed manner between the V-shape of the index finger and thumb, which points to the player.{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=92}} There are other grips that allow performers to play much more technically difficult rhythms, such as the ''shime'' grip, which is similar to a [[matched grip]]:  the ''bachi'' are gripped at the back end, and the [[fulcrum (drumming)|fulcrum]] rests between the performer's index finger and thumb, while the other fingers remain relaxed and slightly curled around the stick.<ref name=ModernP>{{cite journal|magazine=Modern Percussionist|title=N/A|volume=3|year=1986|publisher=Modern Drummer Publications, Inc.|page=28|oclc=11672313}}</ref>

Performance in some groups is also guided by principles based on [[Zen Buddhism]].  For instance, among other concepts, the San Francisco Taiko Dojo is guided by {{nihongo4|''rei''|<U+793C>}} emphasizing communication, respect, and harmony.{{sfn|Wong|2004|p=84}} The way the ''bachi'' are held can also be significant; for some groups, ''bachi'' represent a spiritual link between the body and the sky.{{sfn|Powell 2012b|loc=''[http://books.google.com/books?id=gGlX7c66X1sC&q=%22body+and+sky%22#v=onepage&q=%22Buddhism%22&f=falsev Ki]''}} Some physical parts of taiko, like the drum body, its skin, and the tacks also hold symbolic significance in Buddhism.{{sfn|Powell 2012b|loc=''[http://books.google.com/books?id=gGlX7c66X1sC&q=%22body+and+sky%22#v=onepage&q=%22Buddhism%22&f=falsev Ki]''}}

===Instrumentation===
[[File:Traditional-taikodrum-may2011.ogv|thumb|Several drummers perform a traditional pattern on a taiko drum at a summer festival in Japan.|alt=Video; refer to caption]]

''Kumi-daiko'' groups consist primarily of percussive instruments where each of the drums plays a specific role. Of the different kinds of taiko, the most common in groups is the ''nagad<U+014D>-daiko''.{{sfn|Dean|2012|p=125}} ''Ch<U+016B>-daiko'' are common in taiko groups{{sfn|Powell 2012a}} and represent the main rhythm of the group, whereas ''shime-daiko'' set and change tempo.{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=55}} ''<U+014C>-daiko'' provide a steady, underlying pulse{{sfn|Alves|2012|p=312}} and serve as a counter-rhythm to the other parts.{{sfn|Tusler|2003|pp=70, 72}} It is common for performances to begin with a [[single stroke roll]] called an ''{{Nihongo4|oroshi|<U+98AA>|"wind blowing down from mountains"}}''.{{sfn|Powell 2012a|loc=[http://books.google.com/books?id=xlZh8b-YXMgC&q=oroshi#v=onepage&q=oroshi&f=false chpt. 7]}} The player starts slowly, leaving considerable space between strikes, gradually shortening the interval between hits, until the drummer is playing a rapid roll of hits.{{sfn|Powell 2012a|loc=[http://books.google.com/books?id=xlZh8b-YXMgC&q=oroshi#v=onepage&q=oroshi&f=false chpt. 7]}} Oroshi are also played as a part of theatrical performance, such as in Noh theater.{{sfn|Malm|1960|pp=75<U+2013>78}}

Drums are not the only instruments played in the ensemble; other Japanese instruments are also used. Other kinds of percussion instruments include the {{nihongo4|''atarigane''|<U+5F53><U+308A><U+9266>}}, a hand-sized gong played with a small mallet.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=32}} In kabuki, the [[shamisen]], a [[plucked string instrument]], often accompanies taiko during the theatrical performance.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=29}} ''Kumi-daiko'' performances can also feature woodwinds such as the [[shakuhachi]]{{sfn|Nelson|2007|p=287}} and the [[shinobue]].{{sfn|Nelson|2007|p=288}}{{sfn|Forss|2010|p=597}}

Voiced calls or shouts called [[kakegoe]] and [[kiai]] are also common in taiko performance.{{sfn|Nelson|2007|p=139}}{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=62}} They are used as encouragement to other players or cues for transition or change in dynamics such as an increase in tempo.{{sfn|Bender|2012|pp=29, 51}} In contrast, the philosophical concept of [[Ma (negative space)|ma]], which superficially describes the space between drum strikes, is also important in shaping rhythmic phrases and creating appropriate contrast.{{sfn|Varian|2013|pp=89<U+2013>90, 125}}

===Clothing===
There is a wide variety of traditional clothing that players wear during taiko performance. Common in many ''kumi-daiko'' groups is the use of the [[happi]], a decorative, thin-fabric coat, and traditional headbands called [[hachimaki]].{{sfn|Konagaya|2005|p=150}} [[Tabi]], {{nihongo4|''momohiki''|<U+3082><U+3082><U+5F15><U+304D>|"loose-fitting pants"}}, and {{nihongo4|''haragake''|<U+8179><U+639B><U+3051>|"working aprons"}} are also typical.{{sfn|Konagaya|2010|p=645}} During his time with the group Ondekoza, Eitetsu Hayashi suggested that a loincloth called a [[fundoshi]] be worn when performing for French fashion designer [[Pierre Cardin]], who saw Ondekoza perform for him in 1975.<ref name=UofC>{{cite journal|title=N/A|journal=Asian Music: Journal of the Society for Asian Music|volume=40|year=2009|publisher=Society for Asian Music|page=108|oclc=53164383}}</ref> The Japanese group Kodo has sometimes worn fundoshi for its performances.{{sfn|Konagaya|2005|p=151}}

==Education==
Taiko performance is generally taught orally and through demonstration.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=115}}{{sfn|Malm|1986|p=24}} Historically, general patterns for taiko were written down, such as in the 1512 encyclopedia called the ''[[Taigensho]]'',{{sfn|Harich-Schneider|1973|p=394}} but written scores for taiko pieces are generally unavailable. One reason for the adherence to an oral tradition is that, from group to group, the rhythmic patterns in a given piece are often performed differently.{{sfn|Malm|1986|p=202}} Furthermore, ethnomusicologist William&nbsp;P. Malm observed that Japanese players within a group could not usefully predict one another using written notation, and instead did so through listening.{{sfn|Malm|1986|pp=24<U+2013>25}} In Japan, printed parts are not used during lessons.{{sfn|Harich-Schneider|1973|p=394}}

Orally, patterns of [[onomatopoeia]] called [[kuchi sh<U+014D>ga]] are taught from teacher to student that convey the rhythm and [[timbre]] of drum strikes for a particular piece.{{sfn|Tusler|2003|pp=90, 271}}{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=90}} For example, {{nihongo4|''don''|<U+3069><U+3093>}} represents a single strike to the center of the drum,{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=90}} where as {{nihongo4|''do-ko''|<U+3069><U+3053>}} represents two successive strikes, first by the right and then the left, and lasts the same amount of time as one ''don'' strike.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=139}} Some taiko pieces, such as ''[[Yatai-bayashi]]'', include patterns that are difficult to represent in [[List of musical symbols|Western musical notation]].{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=139}} The exact words used can also differ from region to region.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=139}}

More recently, Japanese publications have emerged in an attempt to standardize taiko performance. The [[Nippon Taiko Foundation]] was formed in 1979; its primary goals were to foster good relations among taiko groups in Japan and to both publicize and teach how to perform taiko.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=182}}{{sfn|Cangia|2013|p=129}} Daihachi Oguchi, the leader of the Foundation, wrote ''Japan Taiko'' with other teachers in 1994 out of concern that correct form in performance would degrade over time.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=183}} The instructional publication described the different drums used in ''kumi-daiko'' performance, methods of gripping, correct form, and suggestions on instrumentation. The book also contains practice exercises and transcribed pieces from Oguchi's group, Osuwa Daiko. While there were similar textbooks published before 1994, this publication had much more visibility due to the Foundation's scope.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=184}}

The system of fundamentals ''Japan Taiko'' put forward was not widely adopted because taiko performance varied substantially across Japan. An updated 2001 publication from the Foundation, called the {{nihongo4|''Nihon Taiko Ky<U+014D>hon''|<U+65E5><U+672C><U+592A><U+9F13><U+6559><U+672C>|"Japan Taiko Textbook"}}, describes regional variations that depart from the main techniques taught in the textbook. The creators of the text maintained that mastering a set of prescribed basics should be compatible with learning local traditions.{{sfn|Bender|2012|pp=185<U+2013>187}}

==Regional styles==
Aside from ''kumi-daiko'' performance, a number of folk traditions that use taiko have been recognized in different regions in Japan.  Some of these include {{nihongo4|''ondeko''|<U+9B3C><U+592A><U+9F13>|"demon drumming"}} from [[Sado, Niigata|Sado Island]], ''{{Interlanguage link|ja|gion-daiko|<U+5C0F><U+5009><U+7947><U+5712><U+592A><U+9F13>}}'' from the town of [[Kokura]], and ''{{Interlanguage link|ja|sansa-odori|<U+76DB><U+5CA1><U+3055><U+3093><U+3055><U+8E0A><U+308A>}}'' from [[Iwate Prefecture]].{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=225}}

A variety of folk dances originating from [[Okinawa]], known collectively as [[Eisa (dance)|eisa]], often make use of the taiko.{{sfn|Terada|2013|p=234}} Some performers use drums while dancing, and generally speaking, perform in one of two styles:{{sfn|Kumada|2011|pp=193<U+2013>244}} groups on the [[Uruma, Okinawa#Yokatsu Islands|Yokatsu Peninsula]] and on Hamahiga Island use small, single-sided drums called {{nihongo4|''p<U+0101>ranku''|<U+30D1><U+30FC><U+30E9><U+30F3><U+30AF>}} whereas groups near [[Okinawa, Okinawa|the city of Okinawa]] generally use ''shime-daiko''.{{sfn|Terada|2013|p=234}}{{sfn|Kobayashi|1998|pp=36<U+2013>40}} Use of ''shime-daiko'' over ''p<U+0101>ranku'' has spread throughout the island, and is considered the dominant style.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1998|pp=36<U+2013>40}} Small ''nagad<U+014D>-daiko'', referred to as ''<U+014D>-daiko'' within the tradition, are also used{{sfn|Cangia|2013|p=149}} and are worn in front of the performer.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=210}} These drum dances are not limited to Okinawa and have appeared in places containing Okinawan communities such as in [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]], [[Hawaii]], and large cities on the [[Honshu|Japanese mainland]].{{sfn|Terada|2013|p=235}}

===Hachij<U+014D>-daiko===

{{nihongo4|''Hachij<U+014D>-daiko''|<U+516B><U+4E08><U+592A><U+9F13>||trans. "Hachij<U+014D>-style taiko"}} is a taiko tradition originating on the island of [[Hachij<U+014D>-jima]].{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=171}} Two styles of ''Hachij<U+014D>-daiko'' emerged and have been popularized among residents: an older tradition based on a historical account, and a newer tradition influenced by mainland groups and practiced by the majority of the islanders.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=171}}

The ''Hachij<U+014D>-daiko'' tradition was documented as early as 1849 based on a journal kept by an exile named [[Kakuso Kizan]]. He mentioned some of its unique features, such as "a taiko is suspended from a tree while women and children gathered around", and observed that a player used either side of the drum while performing.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=2}} Illustrations from Kizan's journal show features of ''Hachij<U+014D>-daiko''. These illustrations also featured women performing, which is unusual as taiko performance elsewhere during this period was typically reserved for men. Teachers of the tradition have noted that the majority of its performers were women; one estimate asserts that female performers outnumbered males by three to one.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=3}}

On the upright drum, the ''uwa-by<U+014D>shi'' (left) plays more complex rhythms while the ''shita-by<U+014D>shi'' (right) plays a consistent underlying rhythm.|alt=refer to caption]]
The first style of Hachij<U+014D>-daiko is thought to descend directly from the style reported by Kizan. This style is called ''Kumaoji-daiko'', named after its creator Okuyama Kumaoji, a central performer of the style.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=5}} ''Kumaoji-daiko'' has two players on a single drum, one of whom, called the {{nihongo4|''shita-by<U+014D>shi''|<U+4E0B><U+62CD><U+5B50>|"lower beat"}}, provides the underlying beat.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=8}} The other player, called the {{nihongo4|''uwa-by<U+014D>shi''|<U+4E0A><U+62CD><U+5B50>|"upper beat"}}, builds on this rhythmical foundation with unique and typically improvised rhythms.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=8}}{{sfn|Honda|1984|p=931}} While there are specific types of underlying rhythms, the accompanying player is free to express an original musical beat.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=8}} ''Kumaoji-daiko'' also features an unusual positioning for taiko: the drums are sometimes suspended from ropes,{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=7}} and historically, sometimes drums were suspended from trees.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=2}}

The contemporary style of ''Hachij<U+014D>-daiko'' is called {{nihongo4|''shin-daiko''|<U+65B0><U+592A><U+9F13>|"new taiko"}}, which differs from ''Kumaoji-daiko'' in multiple ways.  For instance, while the lead and accompanying roles are still present, ''shin-daiko'' performances use larger drums exclusively on stands.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|pp=14, 18<U+2013>19}} ''Shin-daiko'' emphasizes a more powerful sound, and consequently, performers use larger bachi made out of stronger wood.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=19}} Looser clothing is worn by ''shin-daiko'' performers compared to [[kimono]] worn by ''Kumaoji-daiko'' performers; the looser clothing in ''shin-daiko'' allow performers to adopt more open stances and larger movements with the legs and arms.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|pp=14, 19}} Rhythms used for the accompanying ''shita-by<U+014D>shi'' role can also differ.  One type of rhythm, called ''y<U+016B>kichi'', consists of the following:

[[File:Yukichi.png|alt=Music notation indicating a drum rhythm|center]]

This rhythm is found in both styles, but is always played faster in ''shin-daiko''.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=14}} Another type of rhythm, called ''honbadaki'', is unique to ''shin-daiko'' and also contains a song which is performed in standard Japanese.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=14}}

{{nihongo4|''Miyake-daiko''|<U+4E09><U+5B85><U+592A><U+9F13>||trans.

===Australia===
Taiko groups in Australia began forming in the 1990s.{{sfn|Bloustein|1999|p=131}} The first group, called Ataru Taru Taiko, was formed in 1995 by Paulene Thomas, Harold Gent, and Kaomori Kamei.{{sfn|Bloustein|1999|p=166}} [[TaikOz]] was later formed by percussionist Ian Cleworth and [[Riley Lee]], a former Ondekoza member, and has been performing in Australia since 1997.{{sfn|de Ferranti|2007|p=80}} They are known for their work in generating interest in performing taiko among Australian audiences, such as by developing a complete education program with both formal and informal classes,{{sfn|Webb|Seddon|2012|p=762}} and have a strong fan base.{{sfn|de Ferranti|2007|p=91}} Cleworth and other members of the group have developed several original pieces.{{sfn|de Ferranti|2007|p=84}}

The introduction of ''kumi-daiko'' performance in Brazil can be traced back to the 1970s and 1980s in S<U+00E3>o Paulo.{{sfn|Lorenz|2007|p=102}} [[Tangue Setsuko]] founded an eponymous taiko dojo and was Brazil's first taiko group;{{sfn|Lorenz|2007|p=102}} [[Setsuo Kinoshita]] later formed the group Wadaiko Sho.{{sfn|Lorenz|2007|p=26}} Brazilian groups have combined native and [[Rhythm in Sub-Saharan Africa|African drumming techniques]] with taiko performance. One such piece developed by Kinoshita is called ''Taiko de Samba'', which emphasizes both Brazilian and Japanese aesthetics in percussion traditions.{{sfn|Lorenz|2007|pp=115, 130<U+2013>139}} Taiko was also popularized in Brazil from 2002 through the work of Yukihisa Oda, a Japanese native who visited Brazil several times through the [[Japan International Cooperation Agency]].<ref name=Horikawa>{{cite web|last=Horikawa|first=Helder|url=http://www.nippobrasil.com.br/especial/537.shtml |title=Mat<U+00E9>rias Especiais <U+2013> Jornal NippoBrasil |publisher=Nippobrasil|accessdate=22 August 2013|language=Portuguese}}</ref>

The Brazilian Association of Taiko (ABT) suggests that there are about 150 taiko groups in Brazil and that about 10<U+2013>15% of players are non-Japanese; Izumo Honda, coordinator of a large annual festival in S<U+00E3>o Paulo, estimated that about 60% are women.<ref name=Horikawa />

Taiko emerged in the United States in the late 1960s.

==Related cultural and social movements==
Certain peoples have used taiko to advance social or cultural movements, both within Japan and elsewhere in the world.

===Gender conventions===
Taiko performance has frequently been viewed as an art form dominated by men.<ref>{{bulleted list|{{cite journal|title=Hono Taiko|journal=The New Yorker|date=11 October 1999|page=17|publisher=F-R Publishing Corporation}}|{{cite news|last=Lin|first=Angel|title=Taiko Drummers Celebrate Heritage|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/stupub/ocreview/2007/04/20/arts/Taiko_Drummers_Celebrate_H.html|accessdate=5 January 2014|newspaper=The Oberlin Review|date=20 April 2007}}}}</ref>{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=144}} Historians of taiko argue that its performance comes from masculine traditions. Those who developed ensemble-style taiko in Japan were men,{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=144}} and through the influence of Ondekoza, the "ideal taiko player" was epitomized in images of the masculine peasant class,{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=144}} particularly through the character Muh<U+014D>matsu in the 1958 film ''[[Rickshaw Man]]''.{{sfn|Konagaya|2005|p=150}}{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=144}} Masculine roots have also been attributed to "spectacular bodily performance"{{sfn|Konagaya|2007|p=2}} where women's bodies are assumed to be unable to meet the physical demands of playing.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=145}}

Before the 1980s, it was uncommon for Japanese women to perform on traditional instruments, including taiko, as their participation had been systematically restricted.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=144}} In Ondekoza and in the early performances of Kodo, women performed only dance routines either during or between taiko performances.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=155}} Thereafter, female participation in ''kumi-daiko'' started to rise dramatically, and by the 1990s, women equaled and possibly exceeded representation by men.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=144}} While the proportion of women in taiko has become substantial, some have expressed concern that women still do not perform in the same roles as their male counterparts and that taiko performance continues to be a male-dominated profession.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=145}} For instance, a member of Kodo was informed by the director of the group's apprentice program that women were permitted to play, but could only play "as women".{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=153}} Other women in the apprentice program recognized a gender disparity in performance roles, such as what pieces they were allowed to perform, or in physical terms based on a male standard.{{sfn|Bender|2012|pp=154<U+2013>155}}

Female taiko performance has also served as a response to gendered stereotypes of Japanese women as being quiet,{{sfn|Izumi|2001|pp=37<U+2013>39}} subservient, or a [[femme fatale]].<ref name=Chan>{{cite news|last=Chan|first=Erin|title=They're Beating the Drum for Female Empowerment|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jul/15/local/me-taiko15|accessdate=5 January 2014|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=15 July 2002}}</ref> Through performance, some groups believe they are helping to redefine not only the role of women in taiko, but how women are perceived more generally.<ref name="Chan" />{{sfn|Wong|2000|p=74}}

===North American ''sansei''===
Taiko performance was an important part of cultural development by third-generation Japanese residents of in North America, who are called ''[[sansei]]''.{{sfn|Izumi|2006|p=159}}{{sfn|Yoon|2001|p=422}} During [[World War II]], second-generation Japanese residents, called ''[[nisei]]'' faced [[Internment of Japanese Americans|internment in the United States]] and [[Japanese Canadian internment|in Canada]] on the basis of their race.{{sfn|Terada|2001|pp=40<U+2013>41}}{{sfn|Izumi|2001|p=41}} During and after the war, Japanese residents were discouraged from activities such as speaking Japanese or forming ethnic communities.{{sfn|Izumi|2001|p=41}} Subsequently, sansei could not engage in Japanese culture and instead were raised to assimilate into more normative activities.{{sfn|Terada|2001|p=41}} There were also prevailing stereotypes of Japanese people, which sansei sought to escape or subvert.{{sfn|Terada|2001|p=41}} The [[United States civil rights movement]] of the 1960s influenced sansei to reexamine their heritage by engaging in Japanese culture in their communities; one such approach was through taiko performance.{{sfn|Izumi|2001|p=41}}{{sfn|Terada|2001|p=41}} Groups such as San Jose Daiko were organized to fulfill a need for solidarity and to have a medium to express their experiences as Japanese-Americans.{{sfn|Yoon|2001|p=424}} Later generations have adopted taiko in programs or workshops established by sansei; social scientist Hideyo Konagaya remarks that this attraction to taiko among other Japanese art forms may be due to its accessibility and energetic nature.{{sfn|Konagaya|2001|p=117}} Konagaya has also argued that the resurgence of taiko in the United States and Japan are differently motivated: in Japan, performance was meant to represent the need to recapture sacred traditions, while in the United States it was meant to be an explicit representation of masculinity and power in Japanese-American men.{{sfn|Konagaya|2005|p=140}}
