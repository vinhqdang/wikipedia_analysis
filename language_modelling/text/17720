==History==
<!--Please stop adding unwikified text to this section; edit [[History of Toronto]] instead. Thank you.-->
{{main|History of Toronto}}{{See|Toronto's name}}
When [[European]]s first arrived at the site of present-day Toronto, the vicinity was inhabited by the [[Huron]] tribes, who by then had displaced the [[Iroquois]] tribes that occupied the region for centuries before c. 1500. The name ''Toronto'' is likely derived from the Iroquois word ''tkaronto'', meaning "place where trees stand in the water".<ref name=etymology>{{cite web|url=http://geonames.nrcan.gc.ca/education/toronto_e.php|title=The real story of how Toronto got its name|publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]] (2005)|accessdate=2006-12-08}}</ref> It refers to the northern end of what is now [[Lake Simcoe]], where the Huron had planted tree saplings to corral fish. A [[portage]] route from Lake Ontario to [[Lake Huron]] running through this point led to widespread use of the name

[[Image:Toronto 1894large.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Toronto, 1894]]

[[France|French]] traders founded [[Fort Rouill<U+00E9>]] on the current [[Exhibition Place|Exhibition grounds]] in 1750, but abandoned it in 1759.<ref name=rouille>[http://schools.tdsb.on.ca/jarvisci/toronto/rouille.htm Fort Rouill<U+00E9>], Jarvis Collegiate Institute (2006). Retrieved on [[2006]]-[[December 8|12-08]].</ref> During the [[American Revolutionary War]], the region saw an influx of [[British Empire|British]] settlers as [[United Empire Loyalists]] fled for the unsettled lands north of Lake Ontario. In 1787, the British negotiated the [[Toronto Purchase]] with the [[Mississaugas]] of [[New Credit 40a, Ontario|New Credit]], thereby securing more than a quarter million acres (1000 km<U+00B2>) of land in the Toronto area.<ref name=British>[http://www.toronto.ca/culture/history/history-natives-newcomers.htm Natives and newcomers, 1600-1793], City of Toronto (2006). Retrieved on [[2006]]-[[December 8|12-08]].</ref>

In 1793, Governor [[John Graves Simcoe]] established the town of [[York, Upper Canada|York]] on the existing settlement, naming it after [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany]]. Simcoe chose the town to replace [[Niagara-on-the-Lake|Newark]] as the capital of [[Upper Canada]], believing the new site would be less vulnerable to attack by the [[United States|Americans]].<ref name=[[Fort York]]>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortyork.ca|title=Welcome to the birthplace of Toronto|publisher=Friends of Fort York (2006)|accessdate=2006-12-08}}</ref> [[Fort York]] was constructed at the entrance of the town's natural harbour, sheltered by a long sand-bar peninsula. The town's settlement formed at the eastern end of the harbour behind the peninsula, near the present-day Parliament Street and [[Front Street (Toronto)|Front Street]].

In 1813, as part of the [[War of 1812]], the [[Battle of York]] ended in the town's capture and plunder by American forces. The surrender of the town was negotiated by [[John Strachan]]. American soldiers destroyed much of Fort York and set fire on the parliament buildings during their five-day occupation.

[[Image:Toronto Harbour, 1919.jpg|right|thumb|Toronto Harbour, 1919]]

With a population of only 9,000 inhabitants, York was incorporated as the City of Toronto on [[March 6]], [[1834]], reverting to its original native name. These included escaped African-American slaves fleeing [[Black Codes]] in some states,<ref name=black>[http://www.toronto.ca/blackhistory/victorian_exhibit.htm City of Toronto, Black History], City of Toronto (2002). Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[July 7|07-07]].</ref> as slavery had been banned outright in Upper Canada by 1806. Reformist politician [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] became the first Mayor of Toronto, and led the unsuccessful [[Upper Canada Rebellion]] of 1837 against the British colonial government. The city grew rapidly through the remainder of the 19th century, as a major destination for immigrants to Canada. The first significant population influx occurred with the [[Irish potato famine]] between 1846 and 1849 that brought a large number of [[Irish diaspora]] into the city, some of them transient and most of them [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]. By 1851, the Irish-born population had become the largest single ethnic group in the city. Smaller numbers of [[Protestant]] Irish immigrants were welcomed by the existing Scottish and English population, giving the [[Orange Order]] significant influence over Toronto society.

Toronto was twice for brief periods the capital of the united [[Province of Canada]] first from 1849-1852, following unrest in Montreal and later 1856-1858 after which Quebec became capital until just a year prior to [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], since then it has been [[Ottawa, Ontario|Ottawa]]. As it had been for Upper Canada from 1793, Toronto became the capital of the province of Ontario after its official creation in 1867 and has remained so since with the Ontario Legislature located at [[Queen's Park, Toronto|Queen's Park]]. Because of its capital status, the city has also always been the location of [[Government House (Ontario)|Government House]], the residence of the [[Viceroy|vice-regal]] representative of the [[Monarchy in Canada|Crown]].

[[Image:1920 Toronto QueenSt from OldCityHall.jpg|thumb|right|A view of [[Queen Street West|Queen Street]] from [[Old City Hall]], 1920.]]

The city began to rapidly industrialize in the middle of the 19th century. An extensive sewage system was built, and streets became illuminated with [[gas lighting]] as a regular service. Long-distance railway lines were constructed, including a route completed in 1854 linking Toronto with the Upper Great Lakes. The [[Grand Trunk Railway]] and the [[Great Northern Railway (US)|Great Northern Railway]] joined in the building of the first [[Old Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] in downtown. The advent of the railway dramatically increased the numbers of immigrants arriving and commerce, as had the Lake Ontario steamers and schooners entering the port and enabled Toronto to become a major gateway linking the world to the interior of the North American continent. Horse-drawn streetcars gave way to electric streetcars in 1891, when the city granted the operation of the transit franchise to the [[Toronto Railway Company]] later re-named the current [[Toronto Transit Commission]], now with the third highest ridership of any city public transportation system in North America.

The [[1904 Toronto fire|Great Toronto Fire of 1904]] destroyed a large section of downtown Toronto, but the city was quickly rebuilt. The fire had cost more than $10 million in damage, and led to more stringent fire safety laws and the expansion of the city's fire department.

[[Image:1949 Toronto TTC YongeSubwayConstruction1.jpg|thumb|left|Subway construction on Yonge Street, 1949]]

The city received new immigrant groups beginning in the late 19th century into early 20th century, particularly [[German people|Germans]], [[Italian people|Italians]], and [[Jews]] from various parts of [[Eastern Europe]]. They were soon followed by [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Russian people|Russians]], [[Poles]] and immigrants from other [[Eastern European]] nations, as the [[Irish people|Irish]] before them, many of these new migrants lived in overcrowded shanty type slums, such as the "the Ward" which was between [[Bay Street]], now the heart of the country finances and the [[MaRS Discovery District|Discovery District]], considered one of the world's most advanced medical research zones. Despite its fast paced growth, by the 1920s, Toronto's population and economic importance in Canada remained second to the much longer established [[Montreal]]. However, by 1934 the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] had become the largest in the country.

Following the [[World War II|Second World War]], refugees from war-torn Europe arrived as did construction labourers particularly from [[Italy]] and [[Portugal]]. Following elimination of racially based [[immigration]] policies by the late 1960s, immigration began from all parts of the world. Toronto's population grew to more than one million in 1951 when large-scale [[suburbanization]] began, and doubled to two million by 1971. By the 1980s, Toronto had surpassed [[Montreal]] as Canada's most populous city and the chief economic hub. During this time, in part due to the political uncertainty raised by the resurgence of the [[Quebec sovereignty movement]], many national and multinational corporations moved their head offices from [[Montreal]] to Toronto and other western Canadian cities.<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3683/is_200201/ai_n9069631/pg_1 Westward ho? The shifting geography of corporate power in Canada], Journal of Canadian Studies (2002). Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[January 14|01-14]].</ref>

In 1954, the City of Toronto was federated into a [[regional municipality|regional government]] known as [[Metropolitan Toronto]].<ref>[http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/DBLaws/RepealedStatutes/English/90m62_e.htm Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act], [[Government of Ontario]] (2000). Retrieved on [[2006]]-[[December 29|12-29]].</ref> The postwar boom had resulted in rapid suburban development, and it was believed that a coordinated land use strategy and shared services would provide greater efficiency for the region. The metropolitan government began to manage services that crossed municipal boundaries, including [[highways]], water and [[public transit]]. In 1967, the seven smallest municipalities of the region were merged into their larger neighbours, resulting in a six-city configuration that included the old [[Old Toronto, Ontario|City of Toronto]] and the surrounding municipalities of [[East York, Ontario|East York]], [[Etobicoke, Ontario|Etobicoke]], [[North York, Ontario|North York]], [[Scarborough, Ontario|Scarborough]] and [[York, Ontario|York]]. In 1998, the metropolitan government was dissolved and the six municipalities were [[amalgamation (politics)|amalgamated]] into a single municipality, creating the current City of Toronto, where [[David Miller (Canadian politician)|David Miller]] is the current Mayor.

==Geography and climate==
[[Image:Toronto Landsat.jpg|thumb|A simulated-colour image of Toronto taken by [[NASA]]'s [[Landsat 7]] satellite.]]
{{main|Geography and climate of Toronto}}
Toronto covers an area of 629.91 square kilometres (243.21 [[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]),<ref name=population>[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/standard/popdwell/Table-CSD-P.cfm?PR=35&T=2&SR=1&S=3&O=D Population statistics and land area], Statistics Canada (2001). Retrieved on [[2006]]-[[December 5|12-05]].</ref> with a maximum north-south distance of 21&nbsp;kilometres&nbsp;(13&nbsp;mi) and a maximum east-west distance of 43 kilometres (27&nbsp;mi). It has a 46 kilometre (29&nbsp;mi) long [[Toronto waterfront|waterfront]] shoreline. Its borders are bounded by [[Lake Ontario]] to the south, [[Etobicoke Creek]] and [[Highway 427 (Ontario)|Highway 427]] to the west, [[Steeles Avenue]] to the north and the [[Rouge River (Ontario)|Rouge River]] to the east.

===Topography===
The city is intersected by two rivers and numerous tributaries: the [[Humber River (Toronto)|Humber River]] in the west end and the [[Don River (Toronto)|Don River]] east of downtown at opposite ends of the [[Toronto Harbour]]. The harbour was naturally created by sediment build-up from lake currents that created the [[Toronto Islands]] and the [[Leslie Street Spit]]. The many creeks and rivers cutting from north toward the lake create large tracts of densely-forested [[Toronto ravine system|ravine]]s, and provide ideal sites for parks and recreational trails. However, the ravines also interfere with the city's [[grid plan]], and this results in major thoroughfares such as [[Finch Avenue]], [[Leslie Street]], [[Lawrence Avenue]], [[St. Clair Avenue]] and [[Keele Street]] terminating on one side of ravines and continuing on the other side. Other thoroughfares such as the [[Prince Edward Viaduct|Bloor Street Viaduct]] are required to span above the ravines. These deep ravines prove useful for draining the city's vast storm sewer system during heavy rains but some sections, particularly near the Don River are prone to sudden, heavy floods. Storage tanks at waste treatment facilities will often receive too much river discharge causing them to overflow, allowing untreated sewage to escape into Lake Ontario closing local beaches for swimming.

During the last [[ice age]], the lower part of Toronto was beneath [[Glacial Lake Iroquois]]. Today, a series of [[escarpments]] mark the lake's former boundary, known as the [[Iroquois Shoreline]]. The escarpments are most prominent from [[Victoria Park Avenue]] to the mouth of [[Highland Creek]], where they form the [[Scarborough Bluffs]]. Other noticeable sections include the area near [[St. Clair Avenue]] West between [[Bathurst Street]] and the Don River, and north of Davenport Road from Caledonia to Spadina Avenue, the [[Casa Loma]] grounds sit above this escarpment. Although not remarkably hilly, Toronto does have elevation differences ranging from 75 metres (246&nbsp;ft) above-sea-level at the Lake Ontario shore to 270 metres (886&nbsp;ft) ASL near the [[York University]] grounds in the city's north end.

Much of the current lakeshore land area fronting the Toronto Harbour is actually artificial landfill. In the mid-19th century the lakefront was set back up to a kilometre (0.6&nbsp;mi) further inland than it is today. Much of the Toronto harbour (the quays, formerly known as wharves) and adjacent Portlands are also fill. The Toronto Islands were actually a landspit until a storm in 1858 severed its connection to the mainland, creating a channel later used by shipping interests to access the docks.

[[Image:Dundas and University Winter.JPG|right|thumb|180px|Mid-Winter scene at the intersection of [[Dundas Street]] and [[University Avenue (Toronto)|University Avenue]].]]

===Climate===
Toronto's climate is moderate for Canada due to its southerly location within the country and its proximity to Lake Ontario. It has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Koppen climate classification]] ''Dfa''), with warm, humid summers and generally cold winters, although fairly mild by Canadian and many northern continental [[United States|U.S.]] standards. The city experiences four distinct seasons with considerable variance in day to day temperature, particularly during the colder weather season. Due to urbanization and other factors Toronto has a fairly low diurnal temperature range, at least in built-up city and lakeshore areas. At different times of the year, the proximity to Lake Ontario and the other Great Lakes has various localized and regional impacts on the climate, including [[lake effect snow]].

Toronto winters sometimes feature short cold snaps where maximum temperatures remain below -10 <U+00B0>C (14 <U+00B0>F), often made to feel colder by windchill. Snowstorms, sometimes mixed with ice and rain can disrupt work and travel schedules, accumulating snow can fall anytime from November until mid-April. However, mild stretches also occur throughout winter melting accumulated snow, with temperatures reaching into the 5 to 14 <U+00B0>C (40 to 57 <U+00B0>F) range and infrequently higher. Summer in Toronto is characterized by long stretches of humid weather. Daytime temperatures occasionally surpass 35 <U+00B0>C (95 <U+00B0>F), with high humidity making it feel oppressive during usually brief periods of hot weather. Spring and Autumn are transitional seasons with generally mild or cool temperatures with alternating dry and wet periods, typical conditions of both seasons usually arrive later than in other continental climates at similar latitudes owing to the presence of Lake Ontario and to a lesser degree, the other Great Lakes.<ref name=climate>[http://www.climate.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?Province=ALL&StationName=toronto&SearchType=BeginsWith&LocateBy=Province&Proximity=25&ProximityFrom=City&StationNumber=&IDType=MSC&CityName=&ParkName=&LatitudeDegrees=&LatitudeMinutes=&LongitudeDegrees=&LongitudeMinutes=&NormalsClass=A&SelNormals=&StnId=5051& Canadian climate normals for 1971 to 2000], [[Environment Canada]] (2004).

Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, but summer is usually the wettest season, the bulk falling during thunderstorms. The average yearly precipitation is 83&nbsp;centimetres (33&nbsp;in), with an average annual snowfall of about 133 centimetres (52 in). Toronto experiences an average of 2,038 sunshine hours or 44% of possible, most of it during the warmer weather season.<ref name=climate>[http://www.climate.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?Province=ALL&StationName=toronto&SearchType=BeginsWith&LocateBy=Province&Proximity=25&ProximityFrom=City&StationNumber=&IDType=MSC&CityName=&ParkName=&LatitudeDegrees=&LatitudeMinutes=&LongitudeDegrees=&LongitudeMinutes=&NormalsClass=A&SelNormals=&StnId=5051& Canadian climate normals for 1971 to 2000], [[Environment Canada]] (2004).

===Architecture===
{{see also|List of tallest buildings in Toronto}} '', [[Architecture in Toronto]], [[List of oldest buildings and structures in Toronto]]''
[[Image:CNTower Skydome 2005-08-05.jpg|right|190px|thumb|A close-up view of the [[CN Tower]] from [[Rogers Centre]].]]
[[Image:GardinerMuseum.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Gardiner Museum of Ceramic Art]]

Defining the Toronto skyline is the [[CN Tower]]. At a height of 553.33 metres (1,815 ft, 5 in) it is  the world's tallest freestanding structure, an important telecommunications hub, and a centre of tourism in Toronto.

Toronto is a city of high-rises, having 1,892 buildings over 90 metres (300 ft) in height, second only to New York (which has over 5,000 such buildings) in North America. Most of these buildings are residential (either rental or condominium). There has been recent media attention given for the need to retrofit many of these buildings, which were constructed beginning in the 1950s as residential apartment blocks to accommodate a quickly growing population. Many of the older buildings are shown to give off high concentrations of [[CO2|CO<sub>2</sub>]] and are thought to be a significant contributor to the [[urban heat island effect]], in addition to the aesthetic concerns as many of the buildings are viewed by many as urban blights often surrounded by limited landscaping and concrete parking lots without integration with the surrounding neighbourhoods.

===Residential===
[[Image:Toronto Row Houses.JPG|left|thumb|150px|[[Row houses]] in urban Toronto.]]

The many residential communities of Toronto express a character distinct from that of the skyscrapers in the commercial core. [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian]]-era residential buildings can be found in enclaves such as [[Rosedale, Toronto|Rosedale]], [[Forest Hill, Toronto|Forest Hill]], [[Cabbagetown, Toronto|Cabbagetown]], [[the Annex]], [[the Bridle Path]] and [[Moore Park, Toronto|Moore Park]].

[[Wychwood Park]] is historically significant for the architecture of its homes, and for being one of Toronto's earliest planned communities. The Wychwood Park neighbourhood was designated as an Ontario Heritage Conservation district in 1985. The [[Casa Loma (neighbourhood)|Casa Loma]] neighbourhood is named after [[Casa Loma]], a medieval castle built in 1911 that had an elevator, secret passages, and bowling alleys. [[Spadina House]] is a 19th century [[manor house|manor]] that is now a museum.

===Neighbourhoods===
{{seealso|List of neighbourhoods in Toronto}}

The City of Toronto encompasses a geographical area formerly administered by six separate municipalities. These municipalities have each developed a distinct history and identity over the years, and their names remain in common use among Torontonians. Throughout the city there exist hundreds of small neighbourhoods and some larger neighbourhoods covering a few square kilometers. Former Municipalities include '''[[East York, Ontario|East York]]''', '''[[Etobicoke, Ontario|Etobicoke]]''', '''[[North York, Ontario|North York]]''', '''[[Old Toronto, Ontario|Old Toronto]]''', '''[[Scarborough, Ontario|Scarborough]]''', '''[[York, Ontario|York]]'''.

[[Image:Toronto central business district.jpg|thumb|right|View of skyscrapers in the Financial District from the [[CN Tower]].]]

====Old Toronto====
The [[Old Toronto, Ontario|Old City of Toronto]] covers the area generally known as [[Downtown Toronto|Downtown]]. It is the historic core of Toronto and remains the most densely-populated part of the city. The Financial District along [[Bay Street]] contains the largest cluster of [[skyscrapers]] in Canada, including the [[First Canadian Place]], [[Toronto Dominion Centre]], [[Scotia Plaza]], [[Royal Bank Plaza]], [[Commerce Court]] and [[BCE Place]]. From that point, the Toronto skyline extends northward along Yonge Street. Old Toronto is also home to many historically wealthy residential enclaves, such as [[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville]], [[Rosedale, Toronto|Rosedale]], [[The Annex]], [[Forest Hill, Toronto|Forest Hill]], [[Lawrence Park, Toronto|Lawrence Park]], Lytton Park, [[Moore Park, Toronto|Moore Park]], and [[Casa Loma - Neighbourhood|Casa Loma]], most stretching away from downtown to the north. These neighbourhoods generally feature upscale homes, luxury condominiums and high-end retail. At the same time, the downtown core vicinity includes neighbourhoods with a high proportion of recent immigrants and low-income families living in social housing and rental [[high-rise]]s, such as [[St. James Town]], [[Regent Park]], [[Moss Park]], Alexandra Park and [[Parkdale, Toronto|Parkdale]]. East and west of Downtown, neighbourhoods such as [[Kensington Market]], [[Leslieville]], [[Cabbagetown]] and [[Riverdale, Toronto|Riverdale]] are home to bustling commercial and cultural areas as well as vibrant communities of artists with studio lofts, with an increasing proportion of middle and upper class professionals that mix with the working poor or those on some form of government assistance. Other neighbourhoods in the central city retain an ethnic identity, including two [[Chinatown, Toronto|Chinatowns]], the popular [[Greektown, Toronto|Greektown]] area, the very trendy [[Little Italy, Toronto|Little Italy]], [[Portugal Village, Toronto|Portugal Village]], [[Eglinton West|Little Jamaica]], Little Mogadishu and Little India along with others.
[[Image:Day5spadinamorning.JPG|left|thumb|200px|View of rows of houses, from a [[Spadina Avenue]] penthouse facing west.]]

====Inner suburbs====
The inner suburbs are contained within the former municipalities of [[York, Ontario|York]] and [[East York, Ontario|East York]]. These are mature and traditionally working class areas, primarily consisting of post-[[World War I]] small, single-family homes and small apartment blocks. Neighbourhoods such as [[Crescent Town]], [[Thorncliffe Park]], [[Weston, Toronto|Weston]], and [[Oakwood - Vaughan]] consist of mainly high-rise apartments which are home to many new immigrant families. Recently, many neighbourhoods have became ethnically diverse and have undergone [[gentrification]], as a result of increasing population and a housing boom during the late 1990s and 2000s. The first neighbourhoods affected were [[Leaside]] and [[North Toronto]], gradually progressing into the western neighbourhoods in York. Some of the area's housing is in the process of being replaced or remodelled.

====Outer suburbs====
[[Image:Toronto Summer Night.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Downtown Toronto as seen from the north on a clear summer night.]]
The outer suburbs comprising the former municipalities of [[Etobicoke, Ontario|Etobicoke]], [[Scarborough, Ontario|Scarborough]] and [[North York, Ontario|North York]] largely retain the [[grid plan]] laid before post-war development. Sections were long established and quickly growing towns before the suburban housing boom began and the advent of Metro Government, such as [[Mimico, Ontario|Mimico]], [[Newtonbrook, Ontario|Newtonbrook]] and [[West Hill, Ontario|West Hill]]. Suburban development grew quickly after the second war to include such upscale neighbourhoods as the [[Bridle Path, Toronto|Bridle Path]] in North York, the area surrounding the [[Scarborough Bluffs]] in [[Guildwood]], and most of central Etobicoke, such as [[Humber Valley Village]], and [[The Kingsway]]. One of largest and earliest "planned communities" was [[Don Mills, Ontario|Don Mills]], parts of which were first built in the 1950s.<ref>"Plan town of 45,000 on Don Mills farms; Will cost $200,000,000," Paul L. Fox, ''[[Toronto Star]]'', [[March 12]] [[1953]], p. 3. Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[May 2|05-02]].</ref> Phased development mixing single-detached housing with higher density apartment blocks became more popular as a suburban model of development. To some this model has been copied in other GTA municipalities surrounding Toronto, albeit with less population density. More recently, [[North York Centre]] that runs along [[Yonge Street]] and the [[Scarborough City Centre]] have emerged as secondary business districts outside the downtown core. High-rise development in these areas have given North York and Scarborough distinguishable skylines of their own and a more downtown feel with high-density transit corridors serving them.

===Industrial===
One of Toronto's most unique neighbourhoods, the [[Distillery District]] contains the largest and best-preserved collection of [[Victorian]] industrial architecture in North America. A national heritage site, it was listed by [[National Geographic]] magazine as a "top pick" in Canada for travellers. Large tracts of industrial land still exist particularly with Scarborough and Etobicoke, although not to the extent that they once did.

===Public spaces===
[[Image:Dundas Square.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Dundas Square, a city square in downtown Toronto.]]
[[Image:Hto Park Urban Beach 2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Toronto's first urban beach.]]

[[Nathan Phillips Square]], a city square that forms the south entrance to [[Toronto City Hall]], is also undergoing a major redesign by Shore Tilbe Irwin & Partners, Plant Architect, Adrian Blackwell and Peter Lindsay Schaudt Landscape Architect (winners of the International Design Competition in 2006/2007).

West 8, a Dutch architecture firm, won the Central Waterfront Innovative Design Competition in 2006 to provide a new look for the central part of the [[Toronto waterfront]].<ref>{{cite web

In the summer of 1999, [[Downsview Park]] initiated an international design competition to realize its vision of creating Canada's first national [[urban park]]. In May 2000, the winning park design was announced: "TREE CITY", by the team of Bruce Mau Design, Office for Metropolitan Architecture, Oleson Worland Architect and Inside/Outside.

{{main|Culture in Toronto}}
<!--Please add content to this "main" article, not here! Thank you.-->
Toronto is a major scene for [[theatre]] and other [[performing arts]], with more than fifty ballet and dance companies, six opera companies, and two symphony orchestras. The city is home to the [[National Ballet of Canada]], the [[Canadian Opera Company]], and the [[Toronto Symphony Orchestra]]. Notable performance venues include the [[Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts]], [[Roy Thomson Hall]], the [[Princess of Wales Theatre]], the [[Royal Alexandra Theatre]], [[Massey Hall]], the [[Toronto Centre for the Arts]], the [[Elgin and Winter Garden Theatres]] and the [[Hummingbird Centre]] (formerly the "O'Keefe Centre").
[[Ontario Place]] features the world's first permanent [[IMAX]] movie theatre, the [[Cinesphere]],<ref>[http://www.ontarioplace.com/en/Cinesphere/index.html The World's First Permanent IMAX Theatre] Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[May 2|05-02]].</ref> as well as the [[Molson Amphitheatre]], an open-air venue for large-scale music concerts. Each summer, the [[Canadian Stage]] Company presents an outdoor [[Shakespeare]] production in Toronto<U+2019>s [[High Park]] called "Dream in High Park". [[Canada's Walk of Fame]] acknowledges the achievements of successful Canadians, with of a series of stars on designated blocks of sidewalks along King Street and Simcoe Street.
[[Image:Hockey Hall of Fame.JPG|right|thumb|The [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], housed in a former bank erected in 1885, is located at the intersection of Front Street and Yonge Street in Downtown Toronto.]]
The [[Distillery District]] is a pedestrian village containing [[boutiques]], art galleries, restaurants, artist studios and small breweries, including the well-known [[Mill Street Brewery]]. A new theatre in the district, the [[Young Centre for the Performing Arts]], is the home of the [[Soulpepper Theatre Company]] and the drama productions of nearby [[George Brown College]].

The production of domestic and foreign film and television is a major local industry. Many movie releases are screened in Toronto prior to wider release in North America. The [[Toronto International Film Festival]] is one of the most important annual events for the international film industry. Europe's largest film studio, [[Pinewood Studios]] Group of London, is scheduled to open a major new film studio complex in west-end Toronto, with five sound stages, with the first two to open by fall 2008.

Toronto's [[Caribana]] festival takes place from mid-July to early August of every summer, and is one of North America's largest street festivals.<ref name=Caribana>[http://www.caribana.com Toronto Caribbean Carnival (Caribana) Festival 2006], WORD Magazine (2006).

Toronto is a [[single-tier municipality]] governed by a [[Mayor-council government|mayor-council system]]. The structure of the municipal government is stipulated by the [[City of Toronto Act]]. The [[Mayor of Toronto]] is elected by direct popular vote to serve as the [[Head of government|chief executive]] of the city. The [[Toronto City Council]] is a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] legislative body, comprising 44 councillors representing geographical [[Ward (politics)|wards]] throughout the city. The mayor and members of the city council serve four-year terms without [[term limit]]s. (Prior to the [[Toronto municipal election, 2006|2006 municipal election]], the mayor and city councillors served three-year terms.)

At the start of the 2007 term, the city council will have seven standing committees, each consisting of a [[Chairman|chair]], a vice-chair and four other councillors. The Mayor names the committee chairs and the remaining membership of the committees is appointed by City Council.<ref name="committees">{{cite web
