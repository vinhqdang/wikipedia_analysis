==History==

The [[biguanide]] class of anti-diabetic drugs, which also includes the withdrawn agents [[phenformin]] and [[buformin]], originates from the [[Galega officinalis|French lilac]] (''Galega officinalis''), a plant used in folk medicine for several centuries.<ref name = Witters>{{cit journal |author=Witters L |title=The blooming of the French lilac |journal=J Clin Invest |volume=108 |issue=8 |pages=1105<U+2013>7 |year=2001 |pmid=11602616 |doi=10.1172/JCI14178 |pmc=209536 |url=http://www.jci.org/articles/view/14178}}</ref>

Metformin was first described in the scientific literature in 1922, by Emil Werner and James Bell, as a side product in the synthesis of ''N'',''N''-dimethylguanidine.<ref name = werner>{{cit journal |author=Werner E, Bell J |title=The preparation of methylguanidine, and of <U+03B2><U+03B2>-dimethylguanidine by the interaction of dicyanodiamide, and methylammonium and dimethylammonium chlorides respectively |journal=J Chem Soc, Transactions |volume=121|pages=1790<U+2013>5 |year=1921 |doi=10.1039/CT9222101790}}</ref> In 1929, Slotta and Tschesche discovered its sugar-lowering action in rabbits, noting that it was the most potent of the biguanide analogs they studied.<ref name = slotta>See Chemical Abstracts, v.23, 42772 (1929) {{cit journal |author=Werner E, Bell  J|title= Uber Biguanide.

Metformin became available in the [[British National Formulary]] in 1958.

==Treatment of diabetes==
The main use for metformin is in the treatment of [[diabetes mellitus type 2]], especially in [[overweight]] people. In this group, over 10 years of treatment, metformin reduced diabetes complications and overall mortality by about 30% when compared with [[insulin]] and [[sulfonylurea]]s ([[glibenclamide]] and [[chlorpropamide]]) and by about 40% when compared with the group only given dietary advice.<ref name = UKPDS/> This difference held in the patients who were followed for 5<U+2013>10 years after the study.<ref name="pmid18784090">{{cit journal |author=Holman RR, Paul SK, Bethel MA, Matthews DR, Neil HA |title=10-year follow-up of intensive glucose control in type 2 diabetes |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=359 |issue=15 |pages=1577<U+2013>89 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18784090 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0806470 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/359/15/1577}}</ref> In addition, metformin had no effect on body weight: over the 10-year treatment period, the metformin group gained about 1&nbsp;kg, the same as the dietary advice group, while the sulfonylureas group gained 3&nbsp;kg, and the insulin group, 6&nbsp;kg.<ref name = UKPDS>{{cit journal |title=Effect of intensive blood-glucose control with metformin on complications in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes (UKPDS 34).

===Prediabetes===
Metformin treatment of people at risk for type 2 diabetes may decrease their chances of developing the disease, although intensive physical exercise and dieting work significantly better for this purpose. In a large U.S. study known as the Diabetes Prevention Program, participants were divided into groups and given either placebo, metformin, or lifestyle intervention, and followed for an average of three years. The intensive program of lifestyle modifications included a 16-lesson training on dieting and exercise followed by monthly individualized sessions with the goals to decrease the body weight by 7% and engage in a physical activity for at least 150 minutes per week.  The [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of diabetes was 58% lower in the lifestyle group and 31% lower in those given metformin. Among people under 44 years of age and those with a body mass index greater than 35, lifestyle modification was no more effective than metformin, and for those older than 60, metformin was no better than placebo in preventing diabetes.<ref name=DPP>{{cit journal |author=Knowler WC, Barrett-Connor E, Fowler SE, ''et al.'' |author.= |title=Reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes with lifestyle intervention or metformin |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=346 |issue=6 |pages=393<U+2013>403 |year=2002 |month=February |pmid=11832527 |pmc=1370926 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa012512}}</ref> After ten years, the incidence of diabetes was 34% lower in the group of participants given diet and exercise and 18% lower in those given metformin.<ref name=DPP10>{{cit journal |author=Knowler WC, Fowler SE, Hamman RF, ''et al.'' |author.= |title=10-year follow-up of diabetes incidence and weight loss in the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study |journal=Lancet |volume=374 |issue=9702 |pages=1677<U+2013>86 |year=2009 |month=November |pmid=19878986 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61457-4}}</ref> It is unclear whether metformin slowed down the progression of pre-diabetes to diabetes (true preventive effect), or the decrease of diabetes in the treated population was simply due to its blood-lowering action (treatment effect).<ref>{{cit journal |author=Lilly M, Godwin M |title=Treating prediabetes with metformin: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Can Fam Physician |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=363<U+2013>9 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19366942 |pmc=2669003}}</ref>

===Investigational findings===

A large [[case-control study]] conducted at [[M.D. Anderson Cancer Center]] has suggested that metformin may protect against [[pancreatic cancer]]. The risk of pancreatic cancer in study participants who took metformin was found to be 62% lower than in participants who had never taken it, whereas participants who had used insulin or [[secretagogue]]s (such as the sulfonylureas) were found to have a 5-fold and 2.5-fold higher risk of pancreatic cancer, respectively, compared to participants that had been treated with neither.<ref name=Li>{{cit journal |author=Li D, Yeung SC, Hassan MM, Konopleva M, Abbruzzese JL |title=Antidiabetic therapies affect risk of pancreatic cancer |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=137 |issue=2 |pages=482<U+2013>8 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19375425 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2009.04.013 | url=http://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085%2809%2900555-1/fulltext |laysummary=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/707523 |laysource=Medscape |laydate=August 18, 2009}}</ref> The study had several limitations, however, and the reason for this risk reduction is still unclear.<ref name=Li/> Observational studies conducted by the [[University of Dundee]] have shown a decrease of 25<U+2013>37% in cancer cases in diabetics taking metformin.<ref>{{cit journal |author=Evans JM, Donnelly LA, Emslie-Smith AM, Alessi DR, Morris AD |year=2005 |title=Metformin and reduced risk of cancer of 25<U+2013>37% in diabetic patients |journal=BMJ |volume=330 |pages=1304<U+2013>5 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/330/7503/1304 |doi=10.1136/bmj.38415.708634.F7 |pmid=15849206 |pmc=558205 }}</ref><ref>{{cit journal |author=Libby G, Donnelly LA, Donnan PT, Alessi DR, Morris AD, Evans JM |year=2009 |title=New users of metformin are at low risk of incident cancer: a cohort study among people with type 2 diabetes |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=32 |pages=1620<U+2013>5 |url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/32/9/1620.full |doi=10.2337/dc08-2175 |pmid=19564453 |pmc=2732153 }}</ref>

It is recommended that metformin be temporarily discontinued before any [[medical imaging|radiographic study]] involving [[iodine|iodinated]] [[radiocontrast|contrast]] (such as a contrast-enhanced [[computed tomography|CT scan]] or [[angiogram]]), as contrast dye may temporarily impair kidney function, indirectly leading to lactic acidosis by causing retention of metformin in the body.<!--really the main mechanism?--><ref name="RCR">Weir J (March 19, 1999).

==Adverse effects==
The most common [[adverse drug reaction|adverse effect]] of metformin is gastrointestinal upset, including [[diarrhea]], cramps, nausea, vomiting and increased [[flatulence]]; metformin is more commonly associated with gastrointestinal side effects than most other anti-diabetic drugs.<ref name=Bolen>{{cit journal |author=Bolen S, Feldman L, Vassy J, ''et al.'' |author.= |title=Systematic review: comparative effectiveness and safety of oral medications for type 2 diabetes mellitus |journal=Ann Intern Med |volume=147 |issue=6 |pages=386<U+2013>99 |year=2007 |pmid=17638715 |url=http://www.annals.org/content/147/6/386.long }}</ref> The most serious potential side effect of metformin use is lactic acidosis; this complication is very rare, and seems limited to people with impaired liver or kidney function.

Metformin has also been reported to reduce the blood levels of [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] in patients with [[hypothyroidism]],<ref>{{cit journal |author=Vigersky RA, Filmore-Nassar A, Glass AR |title=Thyrotropin suppression by metformin |journal=J Clin Endocrinol Metab |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=225<U+2013>7 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16219720 |doi=10.1210/jc.2005-1210 |url=http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/full/91/1/225}}</ref> and, in men, [[lutenizing hormone]] and [[testosterone]].<ref>{{cit journal |author=Shegem NS, Nasir AM, Jbour AK, Batieha AM, El-Khateeb MS, Ajlouni KM |title=Effects of short term metformin administration on androgens in normal men |journal=Saudi Med J |volume=23 |issue=8 |pages=934<U+2013>7 |year=2002 |month=August |pmid=12235466}}</ref><ref>{{cit journal |author=Ozata M, Oktenli C, Bingol N, Ozdemir IC |title=The effects of metformin and diet on plasma testosterone and leptin levels in obese men |journal=Obes Res |volume=9 |issue=11 |pages=662<U+2013>7 |year=2001 |month=November |pmid=11707532 |doi=10.1038/oby.2001.90 |url=http://www.nature.com/oby/journal/v9/n11/full/oby200190a.html}}</ref> The clinical significance of these changes is still unknown.

===Gastrointestinal===
In a clinical trial of 286 subjects, 53.2% of the 141 who were given immediate-release metformin (as opposed to [[placebo]]) reported diarrhea, versus 11.7% for placebo, and 25.5% reported nausea/vomiting, versus 8.3% for those on placebo.<ref name = DF&C>{{cit book |title=Drug Facts and Comparisons 2005 |year=2004 |month=October |publisher=Facts and Comparisons |location=St. Louis, Mo |isbn=1574391933 }}</ref>

Gastrointestinal upset can cause severe discomfort for patients; it is most common when metformin is first administered, or when the dose is increased.  The discomfort can often be avoided by beginning at a low dose (1 to 1.7 grams per day) and increasing the dose gradually.  Gastrointestinal upset after prolonged, steady use is less common.

Long-term use of metformin has been associated with increased [[homocysteine]] levels<ref name=Wulffele>{{cit journal |journal=J Intern Med |year=2003|month=November |title=Effects of short-term treatment with metformin on serum concentrations of homocysteine, folate and vitamin B12 in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial |author=Wulffele MG, Kooy A, Lehert P, Bets D, Ogterop JC, Borger van der Burg B, Donker AJ, Stehouwer CD |volume=254 |issue=5 |pages=455<U+2013>63|pmid=14535967 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2796.2003.01213.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118889232/HTMLSTART}}</ref> and [[malabsorption]] of [[cyanocobalamin|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]].<ref name = Andres>{{cit journal |author=Andr<U+00E8>s E, Noel E, Goichot B |title=Metformin-associated vitamin B12 deficiency |journal=Arch Intern Med |volume=162 |issue=19 |pages=2251<U+2013>2 |year=2002 |pmid=12390080 |doi=10.1001/archinte.162.19.2251-a}}</ref><ref name = Gilligan>{{cit journal |author=Gilligan M |title=Metformin and vitamin B12 deficiency |journal=Arch Intern Med |volume=162 |issue=4 |pages=484<U+2013>5 |year=2002 |pmid=11863489 |doi=10.1001/archinte.162.4.484}}</ref> Higher doses and prolonged use are associated with increased incidence of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, and some researchers recommend screening or prevention strategies.<ref>{{cit journal |author=Ting R, Szeto C, Chan M, Ma K, Chow K |title=Risk factors of vitamin B(12) deficiency in patients receiving metformin |journal=Arch Intern Med |volume=166 |issue=18 |pages=1975<U+2013>9 |year=2006 |pmid=17030830 |doi=10.1001/archinte.166.18.1975 |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/166/18/1975}}</ref>

===Lactic acidosis===
The most serious potential adverse effect of biguanide use is [[lactic acidosis]]. [[Phenformin]], another biguanide, was withdrawn from the market because of an increased risk of lactic acidosis (up to 60 cases per [[million]] patient-years). However, metformin is safer than phenformin, and the risk of developing lactic acidosis is not increased by the medication so long as it is not prescribed to known high-risk groups.<ref name = Salpeter>{{cit journal |author=Salpeter S, Greyber E, Pasternak G, Salpeter E |title=Risk of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis with metformin use in type 2 diabetes mellitus: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=[[Archives of Internal Medicine|Arch Intern Med]] |volume=163 |issue=21 |pages=2594<U+2013>602 |year=2003 |pmid=14638559 |doi=10.1001/archinte.163.21.2594 |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/163/21/2594}}</ref>

====Mechanism====
Lactate uptake by the liver is diminished with metformin administration because lactate is a substrate for hepatic [[gluconeogenesis]], a process which metformin inhibits. In healthy individuals, this slight excess is simply cleared by other mechanisms (including uptake by the kidneys, when their function is unimpaired), and no significant elevation in blood levels of lactate occurs.<ref name=Umesh>{{cit book |author=Maharani U |editor=Papadakis MA, McPhee SJ |chapter=Chapter 27: Diabetes Mellitus & Hypoglycemia |title=CURRENT Medical Diagnosis and Treatment 2010 |edition=49th |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |location= |year=2009 |pages=1092<U+2013>93 |isbn=0-07-162444-9}}</ref> When there is impaired renal function, however, clearance of metformin (and lactate) is reduced and the drug may accumulate, leading to lactic acidosis. Because metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, any condition which may precipitate lactic acidosis is a contraindication to its use. Common causes of increased lactic acid production include [[alcoholism]] (due to depletion of [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD+]] stores), heart failure, and respiratory disease (due to inadequate oxygenation of tissues); the most common cause of impaired lactic acid excretion is kidney disease.<ref name=Golan>{{cit book |author=Shu AD, Myers Jr MG, Shoelson SE |editor=Golan ED ''et al.''

==Formulations==
{{Need consensus|date=December 2009}}
[[Image:Metformin 500mg Tablets.jpg|200px|thumb|Metformin 500&nbsp;mg tablets]]
Metformin is sold under several [[trade name]]s, including ''Glucophage XR'', ''Riomet'', ''Fortamet'', ''Glumetza'', ''Obimet'', ''Dianben'', ''Diabex'', and ''Diaformin''.

Metformin IR (immediate release) is available in 500&nbsp;mg, 850&nbsp;mg, and 1000&nbsp;mg tablets, all now generic in the US.

Metformin SR (slow release) or XR (extended release) was introduced in 2004, in 500&nbsp;mg and 750&nbsp;mg strengths, mainly to counteract the most common gastrointestinal side effects, as well as to increase patient compliance by reducing [[pill burden]]. No difference in effectiveness exists between the two preparations.

===Combinations with other drugs===
Metformin is sometimes prescribed to [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2]] diabetes patients in combination with [[rosiglitazone]].  This drug actively reduces insulin resistance, complementing the action of the metformin.  In 2002, the two drugs were combined into a single product, ''Avandamet'', marketed by [[GlaxoSmithKline]].<ref>{{cite press release |title=FDA Approves GlaxoSmithKline's Avandamet (rosiglitazone maleate and metformin HCl), The Latest Advancement in the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes |publisher=[[GlaxoSmithKline]] |date=October 12, 2002 |accessdate=2006-12-27 |url=http://www.docguide.com/news/content.nsf/news/8525697700573E1885256C4F0075B2B3}}</ref> In 2005, all current stock of Avandamet was seized by the FDA and removed from the market, after inspections showed the factory where it was produced was violating [[Good Manufacturing Practice]]s.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Questions and Answers about the Seizure of Paxil CR and Avandamet |publisher=U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] |date=March 4, 2005 |accessdate=2006-12-27 |url=http://www.fda.gov/oc/qanda/PaxilandAvandamet.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071014014507/http://www.fda.gov/oc/qanda/PaxilandAvandamet.html |archivedate=14 October 2007}}</ref> The drug pair continued to be prescribed separately in the absence of Avandamet, which was available again by the end of that year.

In the United States, metformin is also available in combination with [[pioglitazone]] (trade name ''Actoplus Met''), the [[sulfonylurea]]s [[glipizide]] (trade name ''Metaglip'') and [[glibenclamide]] (known as ''glyburide'' in the United States, trade name ''Glucovance''), the [[dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors|dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor]] [[sitagliptin]] (trade name ''Janumet''), and the [[meglitinide]] [[repaglinide]] (''PrandiMet''). Generic formulations of metformin/glipizide and metformin/glibenclamide are available. A generic formulation of metformin/rosiglitazone from [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries|Teva]] has received tentative approval from the FDA, and is expected to reach the market in early 2012.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/inPlayBriefing/idUSIN20070927170530TEVA20070927 |title=Teva Pharm announces settlement of generic Avandia, Avandamet, and Avandaryl litigation with GlaxoSmithKline |publisher=Reuters |date=September 27, 2007 |accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref>
