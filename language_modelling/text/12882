A '''cult film''', also commonly referred to as a '''cult classic''', is a [[film]] that has acquired a [[cult following]]. Cult films are known for their dedicated, passionate [[fanbase]], an elaborate subculture that engage in repeated viewings, quoting dialogue, and [[audience participation]].  Inclusive definitions allow for major studio productions, especially [[box office bomb]]s, while exclusive definitions focus more on obscure, [[transgressive art|transgressive]] films shunned by the [[mainstream (terminology)|mainstream]].  The difficulty in defining the term and subjectivity of what qualifies as a cult film mirror [[classificatory disputes about art]].  The term ''cult film'' itself was first used in the 1970s to describe the culture that surrounded [[underground film]]s and [[midnight movie]]s, though ''cult'' was in common use in film analysis for decades prior to that.

Cult films trace their origin back to controversial and [[film censorship|suppressed]] films kept alive by dedicated fans.  In some cases, reclaimed or rediscovered films have acquired cult followings decades after their original release, occasionally for their [[camp (style)|camp]] value.  Other cult films have since become well-respected or reassessed as classics; there is debate as to whether these popular and accepted films are still cult films.  After failing in the cinema, some cult films have become regular fixtures on cable television or profitable sellers on home video.  Others have inspired their own [[film festival]]s.  Cult films can both appeal to specific subcultures and form their own subcultures.  Other media that reference cult films can easily identify which demographics they desire to attract and offer savvy fans an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge.

Cult films frequently break cultural taboos, and many feature excessive displays of violence, gore, sexuality, profanity, or combinations thereof.  This can lead to controversy, censorship, and outright bans; less transgressive films may attract similar amounts of controversy when critics call them frivolous or incompetent.  Films that fail to attract requisite amounts of controversy may face resistance when labeled as cult films.  Mainstream films and big budget blockbusters have attracted cult followings similar to more underground and lesser known films; fans of these films often emphasize the films' niche appeal and reject the more popular aspects.  Fans who like the films for the wrong reasons, such as perceived elements that represent mainstream appeal and marketing, will often be ostracized or ridiculed.  Likewise, fans who stray from accepted subcultural scripts may experience similar rejection.

Since the late 1970s, cult films have become increasingly popular.  Films that once would have been limited to obscure cult followings are now capable of breaking into the mainstream, and showings of cult films have proved to be a profitable business venture.  Overbroad usage of the term has resulted in controversy, as purists state it has become a meaningless descriptor applied to any film that is the slightest bit weird or unconventional; others accuse Hollywood studios of trying to artificially create cult films or use the term as a marketing tactic.  Films are frequently stated to be an "instant cult classic" now, occasionally before they are released.  Fickle fans on the Internet have latched on to unreleased films only to abandon them later on release.  At the same time, other films have acquired massive, quick cult followings, thanks to spreading [[viral marketing|virally]] through [[social media]].  Easy access to cult films via [[video on demand]] and [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] has led some critics to pronounce the death of cult films.

In 2008, ''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]'' asked a range of academics for their definition of a cult film.  Several people defined cult films primarily in terms of their opposition to mainstream films and conformism, explicitly requiring a [[transgressive art|transgressive]] element, though others disputed the transgressive potential, given the demographic appeal to white males and mainstreaming of cult films.  Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock instead called them mainstream films with transgressive elements.  Most definitions also required a strong community aspect, such as obsessed fans or ritualistic behavior.  Citing misuse of the term, Mikel J. Koven took a self-described hard-line stance that rejected definitions that use any other criteria.  Matt Hills instead stressed the need for an open-ended definition rooted in [[structuration]], where the film and the audience reaction are interrelated and neither is prioritized.  [[Ernest Mathijs]] focused on the accidental nature of cult followings, arguing that cult film fans consider themselves too savvy to be marketed to, while [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] rejected the continued existence of cult films and called the term a marketing buzzword.<ref name=cineaste>{{cite journal| last1=Church| first1=David| last2=Hills| first2=Matt| last3=Hunter| first3=I.

That cult films can have opposing qualities <U+2013> such as good and bad, failure and success, innovative and retro <U+2013> helps to illustrate that art is subjective and never self-evident.<ref name=cineaste />  This ambiguity leads critics of [[postmodernism]] to accuse cult films of being beyond criticism, as the emphasis is now on personal interpretation rather than critical analysis or [[metanarrative]]s.<ref name=shiel />  These inherent dichotomies can lead audiences to be split between ironic and earnest fans.<ref>{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Jason|title=Cult horror House finally finds home in Toronto|url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2010/07/22/cult_horror_house_finally_finds_home_in_toronto.html|accessdate=2013-05-19|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=2010-07-22}}</ref>

Writing in ''Defining Cult Movies'', Jancovich et al. quote academic Jeffrey Sconce, who defines cult films in terms of [[paracinema]], marginal films that exist outside critical and cultural acceptance: everything from exploitation to beach party musicals to softcore pornography.  However, they reject cult films as having a single unifying feature; instead, they state that cult films are united in their "subcultural ideology" and opposition to mainstream tastes, itself a vague and undefinable term.  Cult followings themselves can range from adoration to contempt, and they have little in common except for their celebration of nonconformity <U+2013> even the bad films ridiculed by fans are artistically nonconformist, albeit unintentionally.  At the same time, they state that bourgeois, masculine tastes are frequently reinforced, which makes cult films more of an internal conflict within the bourgeoisie, rather than a rebellion against it.  This results in an anti-academic bias despite the use of formal methodologies, such as [[defamiliarization]].<ref name=cult-intro>{{cite book|title=Defining Cult Movies: The Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste|last1=Jancovich|first1=Mark|last2=Reboll|first2=Antonio L<U+00E0>zaro|last3=Stringer|first3=Julian|last4=Willis|first4=Andy|year=2003|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|location=Manchester|isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3|pages=1<U+2013>3|chapter=Introduction|display-editors=4}}</ref>  This contradiction exists in many subcultures, especially those dependent on defining themselves in terms of opposition to the mainstream.

Due to their rejection of mainstream appeal, Mendik says cult films can be more creative and political; times of relative political instability produce more interesting films.<ref name=sheep>{{cite journal|last=S<U+00E9>lavy|first=Virginie|title=Interview with Xavier Mendik|journal=Electric Sheep|date=2008-05-01|url=http://www.electricsheepmagazine.co.uk/features/2008/05/01/interview-with-xavier-mendik/|accessdate=2013-06-28}}</ref>

Cult films have existed since the early days of cinema.  Film critic Harry Allan Potamkin traces them back to 1910s France and the reception of [[Pearl White]], [[William S. Hart]], and [[Charlie Chaplin]], which he described as "a dissent from the popular ritual".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Cult Film Reader|last=Potamkin|first=Harry Allen|editor1-last=Mathijs|editor1-first=Ernest|editor2-last=Mendik|editor2-first=Xavier|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill International]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-335-21923-0|page=26|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dWX4AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA26|chapter=Film Cults}}</ref>  ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922) was an unauthorized adaptation of [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula (novel)|Dracula]]''.  Stoker's widow sued the production company and drove it to bankruptcy.  All known copies of the film were destroyed, and ''Nosferatu'' become an early cult film, kept alive by a cult following that circulated illegal bootlegs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Phil|title=The Bootleg Files: "Nosferatu"|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/features/2056/|work=[[Film Threat]]|accessdate=2013-04-29|authorlink=Phil Hall (US writer)|date=2007-10-26}}</ref>  Academic Chuck Kleinhans identifies the [[Marx Brothers]] as making other early cult films.<ref name=cineaste />  On their original release, some highly regarded classics from the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]] were panned by critics and audiences, relegated to cult status. ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'' (1955) was a cult film for years, quoted often and championed by fans, before it was reassessed as an important and influential classic.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ventura|first=Elbert|title=The Greatest One-Off in Movie History|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/dvdextras/2010/11/the_greatest_oneoff_in_movie_history.html|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=2013-04-24|date=2010-11-09}}</ref>  During this time, American [[exploitation film]]s and imported European [[art film]]s were marketed similarly. Although critics [[Pauline Kael]] and [[Arthur Knight (film critic)|Arthur Knight]] argued against arbitrary divisions into [[high culture|high]] and [[low culture|low]] culture, American films settled into rigid genres; European art films continued to push the boundaries of simple definitions, and these exploitative art films and artistic exploitation films would go on to influence American cult films.<ref name=betz>{{cite book| last=Betz| first=Mark| title=Defining Cult Movies: the Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste| year=2003| publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]| location=Manchester| isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3| editor1-last=Jancovich| editor1-first=Mark| editor2-last=Reboll| editor2-first=Antionio L<U+00E1>zaro| editor3-last=Stringer| editor3-first=Julian| editor4-last=Willis| editor4-first=Andy| chapter=Art, Exploitation, and Underground|display-editors=4}}</ref>{{rp|202<U+2013>205}}  Much like later cult films, these early exploitation films encouraged audience participation, influenced by live theater and vaudeville.<ref name=alamo />

Modern cult films grew from 1960s [[counterculture]] and [[underground film]]s, popular among those who rejected mainstream Hollywood films.  These underground film festivals led to the creation of [[midnight movie]]s, which attracted cult followings.<ref>{{cite news|last=Patterson|first=John|title=The Weirdo Element|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/mar/02/5|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2013-04-27|date=2007-03-01}}</ref>  The term ''cult film'' itself was an outgrowth of this movement and was first used in the 1970s,<ref>{{cite book|title=Cult Cinema|last1=Mathijs|first1=Ernest|last2=Sexton|first2=Jamie|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-7374-2|page=234|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ntg-1SAKgboC&pg=PA234|chapter=Meta-cult}}</ref> though ''cult'' had been in use for decades in film analysis with both positive and negative connotations.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Cult Film Reader|last1=Mathijs|first1=Ernest|last2=Mendik|first2=Xavier|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill International]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-335-21923-0|page=19|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dWX4AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA19}}</ref>  These films were more concerned with cultural significance than the social justice sought by earlier [[avant-garde film]]s.<ref name=shiel />  Midnight movies became more popular and mainstream, peaking with the release of ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975), which finally found its audience several years after its release.

Releases from major studios <U+2013> such as ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' (1998), which was distributed by [[Universal Studios]] <U+2013> can become cult films when they fail at the box office and develop a cult following through reissues, such as midnight movies, festivals, and home video.  Hollywood films, due to their nature, are more likely to attract this kind of attention, which leads to a mainstreaming effect of cult culture.  With major studios behind them, even financially unsuccessful films can be re-released multiple times, which plays into a trend to capture audiences through repetitious reissues.  The constant use of profanity and drugs in otherwise mainstream, Hollywood films, such as ''The Big Lebowski'', can alienate critics and audiences yet lead to a large cult following among more open-minded demographics not often associated with cult films, such as Wall Street bankers and professional soldiers.  Thus, even comparatively mainstream films can satisfy the traditional demands of a cult film, perceived by fans as transgressive, niche, and uncommercial.<ref>{{cite web|last=Klinger|first=Barbara|title=Becoming Cult: The Big Lebowski, Replay Culture and Male Fans|url=http://library.uoregon.edu/sites/default/files/data/guides/english/klinger_lebowski.pdf|work=[[University of Oregon]]|accessdate=2013-05-11}}</ref>  Discussing his reputation for making cult films, [[Bollywood]] director [[Anurag Kashyap]] said, "I didn't set out to make cult films.

The early cult horror films of [[Peter Jackson]] were so strongly associated with his homeland that they affected the international reputation of New Zealand and [[Cinema of New Zealand|its cinema]].  As more artistic films emerged, New Zealand was perceived as a legitimate competitor to Hollywood, which mirrored Jackson's career trajectory.  ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'' (1994) acquired its own cult following, became a part of New Zealand's national identity, and paved the way for big-budget, Hollywood-style epics, such as Jackson's ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy.<ref>{{cite book| last=Wu| first=Harmony H.| title=Defining Cult Movies: the Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste| year=2003| publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]| location=Manchester| isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3| editor1-last=Jancovich| editor1-first=Mark| editor2-last=Reboll| editor2-first=Antionio L<U+00E1>zaro| editor3-last=Stringer| editor3-first=Julian| editor4-last=Willis| editor4-first=Andy| pages=84<U+2013>104| chapter=Trading in Horror, Cult, and Matricide|display-editors=4}}</ref>

Mathijs states that cult films and fandom frequently involve nontraditional elements of time and time management.  Fans will often watch films obsessively, an activity that is viewed by the mainstream as wasting time yet can be seen as resisting the commodification of leisure time.  They may also watch films idiosyncratically: sped up, slowed down, frequently paused, or at odd hours.  Cult films themselves subvert traditional views of time <U+2013> time travel, non-linear narratives, and ambiguous establishments of time are all popular.  Mathijs also identifies specific cult film viewing habits, such as viewing horror films on Halloween, sentimental melodrama on Christmas, and romantic films on Valentine's Day.  These films are often viewed as marathons where fans can gorge themselves on their favorites.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mathijs|first=Ernest|title=Time Wasted|journal=[[Flow (journal)|Flow]]|date=2010-03-29|volume=11|issue=10|url=http://flowtv.org/2010/03/time-wasted-ernest-mathijs-the-university-of-british-columbia/|accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref>  Mathijs states that cult films broadcast on Christmas have a nostalgic factor.  These films, ritually watched every season, give a sense of community and shared nostalgia to viewers.  New films often have trouble making inroads against the institutions of ''[[It's A Wonderful Life]]'' (1946) and ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]'' (1947).  These films provide mild criticism of consumerism while encouraging family values.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mathijs|first=Ernest|title=Television and the Yuletide Cult|journal=[[Flow (journal)|Flow]]|date=2010-01-08|volume=11|issue=5|url=http://flowtv.org/2010/01/television-and-the-yuletide-cult-ernest-mathijs-the-university-of-british-columbia/|accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref>  Halloween, on the other hand, allows flaunting society's taboos and testing one's fears.  Horror films have appropriated the holiday, and many horror films debut on Halloween.  Mathijs criticizes the over-cultified, commercialized nature of Halloween and horror films, which feed into each other so much that Halloween has turned into an image or product with no real community.  Mathijs states that Halloween horror conventions can provide the missing community aspect.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mathijs|first=Ernest|title=Threat or Treat: Film, Television, and the Ritual of Halloween|journal=[[Flow (journal)|Flow]]|date=2009-10-30|volume=11|issue=1|url=http://flowtv.org/2009/10/threat-or-treat-film-television-and-the-ritual-of-halloween-ernest-mathijs-the-university-of-british-columbia/|accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref>

Despite their oppositional nature, cult films can produce celebrities.

[[Tim Curry]], despite his acknowledged range as an actor, found casting difficult after he achieved fame in ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show''.

==Transgression and censorship==
[[File:Night of the Living Dead affiche.jpg|thumb|alt=Theatrical poster of Night of the Living Dead|''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968) is an example of a cult film that uses transgressive themes.<ref>{{cite book|title=Cult Cinema|last1=Mathijs|first1=Ernest|last2=Sexton|first2=Jamie|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4443-9642-3|page=101|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3EmSqIo4I-QC&pg=PA101|chapter=Transgression and Freakery}}</ref>]]
Transgressive films as a distinct artistic movement began in the 1970s.  Unconcerned with genre distinctions, they drew inspiration equally from the nonconformity of [[European art cinema]] and [[experimental film]], the gritty subject matter of [[Italian neorealism]], and the shocking images of 1960s exploitation.  Some used hardcore pornography and horror, occasionally at the same time.  In the 1980s, filmmaker [[Nick Zedd]] identified this movement as the [[Cinema of Transgression]] and later wrote a manifesto.  Popular in midnight showings, they were mainly limited to large urban areas, which led academic Joan Hawkins to label them as "downtown culture".  These films acquired a legendary reputation as they were discussed and debated in alternative weeklies, such as ''[[The Village Voice]]''.  Home video would finally allow general audiences to see them, which gave many people their first taste of underground film.<ref name=hawkins>{{cite book| last=Hawkins| first=Joan| title=Defining Cult Movies: the Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste| year=2003| publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]| location=Manchester| isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3| editor1-last=Jancovich| editor1-first=Mark| editor2-last=Reboll| editor2-first=Antionio L<U+00E1>zaro| editor3-last=Stringer| editor3-first=Julian| editor4-last=Willis| editor4-first=Andy| chapter=Midnight Sex<U+2013>Horror Movies|display-editors=4}}</ref>{{rp|224<U+2013>230}}  Ernest Mathijs says that cult films often disrupt viewer expectations, such as giving characters transgressive motivations or focusing attention on elements outside the film.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hill|first=Mary Frances|title=Darkness rules for Batman fans in Vancouver|url=http://www2.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=375dc063-9e4f-41c6-bd1e-b653d6cb6314|accessdate=2013-07-08|newspaper=[[Vancouver Sun]]|date=2008-07-20}}</ref>  Cult films can also transgress national stereotypes and genre conventions, such as ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'' (2000), which broke many rules of teenage [[slasher film]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Allsop|first=Samara L.|title=Battle Royale <U+2013> Challenging Global Stereotypes Within the Constructs of a Contemporary Japanese Slasher Film|journal=The Film Journal|year=2002|issue=7|url=http://www.thefilmjournal.com/issue7/battleroyale.html|accessdate=2013-06-24}}</ref>  The reverse <U+2013> when films based on cult properties lose their transgressive edge <U+2013> can result in derision and rejection by fans.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stadler|first=Jane|title=The Cult of Aeon Flux|journal=[[Flow (journal)|Flow]]|date=2007-09-29|volume=6|issue=7|url=http://flowtv.org/2007/09/cult-of-%C3%A6on-flux/|accessdate=2013-06-21}}</ref>  Audience participation itself can be transgressive, such as breaking long-standing taboos against talking during films and throwing things at the screen.<ref name=spoons>{{cite journal| last=McCulloch| first=Richard| title='Most people bring their own spoons': The Room's Participatory Audiences as Comedy Mediators| journal=Participations| year=2011| volume=8| issue=2| url=http://www.participations.org/Volume%208/Issue%202/2d%20McCulloch.pdf| accessdate=2013-06-28}}</ref>{{rp|197}}

According to Mathijs, critical reception is important to a film's perception as cult, through topicality and controversy.  Topicality, which can be regional (such as objection to government funding of the film) or critical (such as philosophical objections to the themes), enables attention and a contextual response.  Cultural topics make the film relevant and can lead to controversy, such as a [[moral panic]], which provides opposition.  Cultural values transgressed in the film, such as sexual promiscuity, can be attacked by proxy, through attacks on the film.  These concerns can vary from culture to culture, and they need not be at all similar.  However, Mathijs says the film must invoke metacommentary for it to be more than simply culturally important.  While referencing previous arguments, critics may attack its choice of genre or its very right to exist.  Taking stances on these varied issues, critics assure their own relevance while helping to elevate the film to cult status.<ref>{{cite book| last=Mathijs| first=Ernest| title=Defining Cult Movies: the Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste| year=2003| publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]| location=Manchester| isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3| editor1-last=Jancovich| editor1-first=Mark| editor2-last=Reboll| editor2-first=Antionio L<U+00E1>zaro| editor3-last=Stringer| editor3-first=Julian| editor4-last=Willis| editor4-first=Andy| pages=109<U+2013>123| chapter=The Making of a Cult Reputation|display-editors=4}}</ref>  Perceived racist and reductive remarks by critics can rally fans and raise the profile of cult films, an example of which would be Rex Reed's [[Rex Reed#Offensive comments in reviews|comments about Korean culture]] in his review of ''[[Oldboy (2003 film)|Oldboy]]'' (2003).<ref name=extreme />  Critics can also polarize audiences and lead debates, such as how Joe Bob Briggs and [[Roger Ebert]] dueled over ''[[I Spit On Your Grave]]'' (1978).

Academic Peter Hutchings, noting the many definitions of a cult film that require transgressive elements, states that cult films are known in part for their excesses.  Both subject matter and its depiction are portrayed in extreme ways that break taboos of good taste and aesthetic norms.  Violence, gore, sexual perversity, and even the music can be pushed to stylistic excess far beyond that allowed by mainstream cinema.  [[Film censorship]] can make these films obscure and difficult to find, common criteria used to define cult films.  Despite this, these films remain well-known and prized among collectors.  Fans will occasionally express frustration with dismissive critics and conventional analysis, which they believe marginalizes and misinterprets paracinema.<ref name=hutchings>{{cite book| last=Hutchings| first=Peter| title=Defining Cult Movies: the Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste| year=2003| publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]| location=Manchester| isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3| editor1-last=Jancovich| editor1-first=Mark| editor2-last=Reboll| editor2-first=Antionio L<U+00E1>zaro| editor3-last=Stringer| editor3-first=Julian| editor4-last=Willis| editor4-first=Andy| chapter=The Argento Effect|display-editors=4}}</ref>{{rp|131<U+2013>134}}  In marketing these films, young men are predominantly targeted.<ref name=extreme />   Horror films in particular can draw fans who seek the most extreme films.<ref name=sick />  Audiences can also ironically latch on to offensive themes, such as misogyny,<ref>{{cite news|last=Jupp|first=Emily|title=Terrible Acting, Flimsy Sets, Wanton Misogyny&nbsp;...

Films that are influenced by unpopular styles or genres can become cult films.  Director [[Jean Rollin]] worked within ''[[fantastique#Cin<U+00E9>ma Fantastique|cin<U+00E9>ma fantastique]]'', an unpopular genre in modern France.

The transgressive nature of cult films can lead to their censorship.  During the 1970s and early 1980s, a wave of explicit, graphic exploitation films caused controversy.

==Subcultural appeal and fandom==
Cult films can be used to help define or create groups as a form of [[subcultural capital]]; knowledge of cult films proves that one is "authentic" or "non-mainstream".  They can be used to provoke an outraged response from the mainstream, which further defines the subculture, as only members could possibly tolerate such deviant entertainment.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mathijs|first1=Ernest|last2=Sexton|first2=Jamie|title=Cult Cinema|year=2011|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|isbn=978-1-4051-7374-2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ntg-1SAKgboC&pg=PA61|chapter=Fandom and Subculture: Cultural Capital and Subcultures|page=61|location=Chichester, West Sussex Malden, MA}}</ref>  More accessible films have less subcultural capital;<ref name=alamo /> among extremists, banned films will have the most.<ref name=sick />  By referencing cult films, media can identify desired demographics, strengthen bonds with specific subcultures, and stand out among those who understand the [[intertextuality]].<ref name=borrowings>{{cite book|last=Cherry|first=Brigid|title=Cultural Borrowings: Appropriation, Reworking, Transformation|chapter=From Cult to Subculture: Re<U+00AD>imaginings of Cult Films in Alternative Music Video|url=http://www.scope.nottingham.ac.uk/cultborr/chapter.php?id=11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004042250/http://www.scope.nottingham.ac.uk/cultborr/chapter.php?id=11|archivedate=2011-10-04|accessdate=2013-05-22|editor-last=Smith|editor-first=Iain Robert|publisher=[[University of Nottingham]]|isbn=978-0-9564641-0-1|year=2009}}</ref>  Popular films from previous eras may be reclaimed by genre fans long after they have been forgotten by the original audiences.

Matt Hills' concept of the "cult blockbuster" involves cult followings inside larger, mainstream films.  Although these are big budget, mainstream films, they still attract cult followings.  The cult fans differentiate themselves from ordinary fans in several ways: longstanding devotion to the film, distinctive interpretations, and [[fan work]]s.  Hills identifies three different cult followings for ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', each with their own fandom separate from the mainstream.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hills|first=Matt|title=The Lord of the Rings: Popular Culture in Global Context|year=2006|publisher=Wallflower Press|location=London New York|isbn=978-1-904764-82-3|pages=160<U+2013>169|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=I8mxughWAOEC&pg=PA160|editor-first=Ernest|editor-last=Mathijs|chapter=Realising the Cult Blockbuster: The Lord of the Rings Fandom and Residual/Emergent Cult Status in 'The Mainstream'}}</ref>  Academic Emma Pett identifies ''[[Back to the Future]]'' (1985) as another example of a cult blockbuster.

For example, in the ''Star Wars'' film series, mainstream [[Jar Jar Binks#Allegations of racial caricature|criticism of Jar Jar Binks]] focused on racial stereotyping; although cult film fans will use that to bolster their arguments, he is rejected because he represents mainstream appeal and marketing.<ref name=trivia>{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=Nathan|chapter=The Importance of Trivia|title=Defining Cult Movies: The Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste|editor1-last=Jancovich|editor1-first=Mark|editor2-last=Reboll|editor2-first=Antionio L<U+00E1>zaro|editor3-last=Stringer|editor3-first=Julian|editor4-last=Willis|editor4-first=Andy|year=2003|publisher=University of Manchester Press|location=Manchester|isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3|display-editors=4}}</ref>{{rp|190<U+2013>193}}  Also, instead of valuing textual rarity, fans of cult blockbusters will value repeat viewings.

Cult films can create their own subculture.  ''Rocky Horror'', originally made to exploit the popularity of [[glam rock|glam subculture]], became what academic Gina Marchetti called a "sub-subculture", a variant that outlived its parent subculture.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Cult Film Reader|last=Marchetti|first=Gina|page=413|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dWX4AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA412|chapter=Subcultural Studies and the Film Audience|editor1-last=Mathijs|editor1-first=Ernest|editor2-last=Mendik|editor2-first=Xavier|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill International]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-335-21923-0}}</ref>  Although often described as primarily composed of obsessed fans, cult film fandom can include many newer, less experienced members.<ref name=spoons />{{rp|190<U+2013>191}}  Familiar with the film's reputation and having watched clips on YouTube, these fans may take the next step and enter the film's fandom.  If they are the majority, they may alter or ignore long-standing traditions, such as audience participation rituals; rituals which lack perceived authenticity may be criticized, but accepted rituals bring subcultural capital to veteran fans who introduce them to the newer members.  Fans who flaunt their knowledge receive negative reactions.  Newer fans may cite the film itself as their reason for attending a showing, but longtime fans often cite the community.  Organized fandoms may spread and become popular as a way of introducing new people to the film, as well as theatrical screenings being privileged by the media and fandom itself.  Fandom can also be used as a process of legitimation.<ref name=spoons />{{rp|200<U+2013>211}}  Fans of cult films, as in [[media fandom]], are frequently producers instead of mere consumers.

Like cult films themselves, magazines and websites dedicated to cult films revel in their self-conscious offensiveness.  They maintain a sense of exclusivity by offending mainstream audiences with misogyny, gore, and racism.  Obsessive trivia can be used to bore mainstream audiences while building up subcultural capital.  Specialist stores on the fringes of society (or websites which prominently partner with hardcore pornographic sites) can be used to reinforce the outsider nature of cult film fandom, especially when they use erotic or gory imagery.<ref name=hollows />{{rp|45<U+2013>47}}  By assuming a preexisting knowledge of trivia, non-fans can be excluded.  Previous articles and controversies can also be alluded to without explanation.  Casual readers and non-fans will thus be left out of discussions and debates, as they lack enough information to meaningfully contribute.  When fans like a cult film for the wrong reasons, such as casting or characters aimed at mainstream appeal, they may be ridiculed.  Thus, fandom can keep the mainstream at bay while defining themselves in terms of the "[[Other]]", a philosophical construct divergent from [[Norm (social)|social norms]].  Commercial aspects of fandom (such as magazines or books) can also be defined in terms of "otherness" and thus valid to consume: consumers purchasing independent or niche publications are discerning consumers, but the mainstream is denigrated.  Irony or self-deprecating humor can also be used.<ref name=trivia />{{rp|192<U+2013>197}}  In online communities, different subcultures attracted to transgressive films can clash over values and criteria for subcultural capital.  Even within subcultures, fans who break subcultural scripts, such as denying the affectivity of a disturbing film, will be ridiculed for their lack of authenticity.<ref name=sick />

===Nostalgia===
According to academic Brigid Cherry, [[nostalgia]] "is a strong element of certain kinds of cult appeal."<ref name=borrowings /> When [[Veoh]] added many cult films to their site, they cited nostalgia as a factor for their popularity.<ref>{{cite web|last=Termen|first=Amanda|title=It's the Site of the Living Dead, as Cult Films Hit Web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1025_3-6047466.html|work=[[CNET]]|accessdate=2013-08-01|date=2006-03-08}}</ref> Academic I. Q. Hunter describes cult films as "New Hollywood ''in extremis''" and a form of nostalgia for that period.  Ernest Mathijs instead states that cult films use nostalgia as a form of resistance against progress and capitalistic ideas of a time-based economy.<ref name=cineaste />  By virtue of the time travel plot, ''Back to the Future'' permits nostalgia for both the 1950s and 1980s.  Many members of its nostalgic cult following are too young to have been alive during those periods, which Emma Pett interprets as fondness for retro aesthetics, nostalgia for when they saw the film rather than when it was released, and looking to the past to find a better time period.<ref name=nostalgia />  Similarly, films directed by [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] have taken hold in midnight movie venues, trading off of nostalgia for the 1980s and an ironic appreciation for their optimism.<ref>{{cite news|last=Beale|first=Lewis|title=John Hughes Versus the Vampires: The Dilemma of the Midnight Movie|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/movies/19beal.html|accessdate=2013-08-01|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2006-06-19}}</ref>  Mathijs and Sexton describe ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978) as a film nostalgic about an imagined past that has acquired a nostalgic cult following.

===Midnight movies===
Author Tomas Crowder-Taraborrelli describes [[midnight movie]]s as a reaction against the political and cultural conservatism in America,<ref name=midnight />{{rp|27}} and Joan Hawkins identifies the movement as running the gamut from anarchist to [[Libertarianism|libertarian]], united in their anti-establishment attitude and punk aesthetic.<ref name=hawkins />{{rp|223}} These films are resistant to simple categorization and are defined by the fanaticism and ritualistic behaviors of their audiences.  Midnight movies require a night life and an audience willing to invest themselves actively.<ref name=midnight>{{cite book|last=Crowder-Taraborrelli|first=Tomas F.|title=Cult Pop Culture: How the Fringe Became Mainstream: How the Fringe Became Mainstream, Volume 1|year=2011|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=978-0-313-35781-7|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jqd92sX1hAoC&pg=PA27|editor-first=Bob|editor-last=Batchelor|chapter=Midnight Movies and the Phenomenon of the Cult Film}}</ref>{{rp|27<U+2013>30}}  Hawkins states that these films took a rather bleak point of view due to the living conditions of the artists and the economic prospects of the 1970s.

Demographics shifted, and more hip and mainstream audiences were drawn to them.  Although studios expressed skepticism, large audiences were drawn to box office flops, such as ''[[Donnie Darko]]'' (2001) and ''[[Office Space]]'' (1999).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Palopoli|first=Steve|title=Cult Rapture|journal=[[Metro Silicon Valley]]|date=2003-09-17|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/cruz/09.17.03/cult-0338.html|accessdate=2013-07-28}}</ref>  Modern midnight movies retain their popularity and have been strongly diverging from mainstream films shown at midnight.  Mainstream cinemas, eager to disassociate themselves from negative associations and increase profits, have begun abandoning midnight screenings.

===Art and exploitation===
Although seemingly at odds with each other, [[art film|art]] and [[exploitation film]]s are frequently treated as equal and interchangeable in cult fandom, listed alongside each other and described in similar terms: their ability to provoke a response.  The most exploitative aspects of art films are thus played up and their academic recognition ignored.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Joan|title=Cutting Edge: Art-Horror and the Horrific Avant-garde|year=2000|publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]]|location=Minneapolis|isbn=0-8166-3413-0|pages=3<U+2013>4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=68whFPvH5VEC&pg=PA3|chapter=Sleaze-Mania, Euro-trash, and High Art}}</ref>  This flattening of culture follows the popularity of [[post-structuralism]], which rejects a hierarchy of artistic merit and equates exploitation and art.<ref name=betz />{{rp|202<U+2013>203}}  Mathijs and Sexton state that although cult films are not synonymous with exploitation, as is occasionally assumed, this is a key component; they write that exploitation, which exists on the fringes of the mainstream and deals with [[taboo]] subjects, is well-suited for cult followings.<ref name=exploitation>{{cite book|first1=Ernest|last1=Mathijs|first2=Jamie|last2=Sexton|title=Cult Cinema|year=2012|publisher=[[Wiley & Sons]]|isbn=978-1-4443-9643-0|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uPtuaV7IAt0C&pg=PT180|chapter=Exploitation and B Movies}}</ref>  Academic David Andrews writes that cult softcore films are "the most masculinized, youth-oriented, populist, and openly pornographic softcore area."<ref name=andrews>{{cite book|title=Soft in the Middle: The Contemporary Softcore Feature in Its Contexts|last=Andrews|first=David|publisher=[[Ohio State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8142-1022-2|page=8|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Zk-F1B7RUfcC&pg=PT23}}</ref> The sexploitation films of [[Russ Meyer]] were among the first to abandon all hypocritical pretenses of morality and were technically proficient enough to gain a cult following.

===B and genre films===
Mathijs and Sexton state that [[film genre|genre]] is an important part of cult films; cult films will often mix, mock, or exaggerate the tropes associated with traditional genres.<ref name=mondo/>  Science fiction, fantasy, and horror are known for their large and dedicated cult followings; as science fiction films become more popular, fans emphasize non-mainstream and less commercial aspects of it.<ref>{{cite book|title=Cult Cinema|last1=Mathijs|first=Ernest|last2=Sexton|first2=Jamie|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-7374-2|pages=205<U+2013>207|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ntg-1SAKgboC&pg=PA205|chapter=Cult Science Fiction Cinema}}</ref>  [[B film]]s, which are often conflated with exploitation, are as important to cult films as exploitation.<ref name=exploitation/>  Teodor Reljic of ''[[Malta Today]]'' states that cult B films are a realistic goal for Malta's burgeoning film industry.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/arts/film/38734/are_cult_films_a_possibility_for_malta|title=Are 'cult' films a possibility for Malta?|last=Reljic|first=Teodor|work=[[Malta Today]]|date=2014-05-08|accessdate=2014-05-08}}</ref>  Genre films, B films that strictly adhere to genre limitations, can appeal to cult film fans: given their transgressive excesses, horror films are likely to become to cult films;<ref name=midnight />{{rp|33}} films like ''[[Galaxy Quest]]'' (1999) highlight the importance of cult followings and fandom to science fiction;<ref>{{cite book|last=Geraghty|first=Lincoln|title=American science fiction film and television.|year=2009|publisher=[[Berg Publishers]]|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-84520-795-3|page=102|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=agDbWF4qJCsC&pg=PA102}}</ref> and authentic martial arts skills in [[Hong Kong action cinema|Hong Kong action films]] can drive them to become cult favorites.<ref name=hunt />{{rp|157<U+2013>159}}  Cult musicals can range from the traditional, such as ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952), which appeal to cult audiences through nostalgia, camp, and spectacle, to the more non-traditional, such as ''[[Cry-Baby]]'' (1990), which parodies musicals, and ''Rocky Horror'', which uses a rock soundtrack.<ref>{{cite book|title=Cult Cinema|last1=Mathijs|first1=Ernest|last2=Sexton|first2=Jamie|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4443-9642-3|pages=175<U+2013>177|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3EmSqIo4I-QC&pg=PA175|chapter=Cult Cinema and Music}}</ref>  Romantic fairy tale ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'' (1987) failed to attract audiences in its original release, as the studio did not know how to market it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/10/07/princess-bride-reunion/|title=As you wish: 'Princess Bride' cast and director talk inconceivable(!) cult hit -- VIDEO|last=Rottenberg|first=Josh|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2011-10-07|accessdate=2014-05-05}}</ref>  The freedom and excitement associated with cars can be an important part of drawing cult film fans to genre films, and they can signify action and danger with more ambiguity than a gun.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/the-auto-motive-why-cars-drive-cult-movies/article11374759/|title=The auto motive: Why cars drive cult movies|last=Pevere|first=Geoff|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=2013-04-18|accessdate=2014-05-03}}</ref>  ''[[Ad Week]]'' writes that cult B films, when released on home video, market themselves and need only enough advertising to raise curiosity or nostalgia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/television/streamy-romance-americans-love-affair-b-movies-goes-digital-157724|title=Streamy Romance: Americans' Love Affair With B Movies Goes Digital|work=[[Ad Week]]|date=2014-05-21|accessdate=2014-05-29}}</ref>

Anime, which is often highly franchised, provides its fans with alternative fictional canons and points of view that can drive fan activity.  The ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' franchise, for example, provided Japanese fans with enough bonus material and spinoffs that it encouraged cult tendencies.

As major Hollywood studios and audiences both become savvy to cult films, productions once limited to cult appeal have instead become popular hits, and cult directors have become hot properties known for more mainstream and accessible films.<ref name=metro />  Remarking on the popular trend of remaking cult films, Claude Brodesser-Akner of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine states that Hollywood studios have been superstitiously hoping to recreate past successes rather than trading on nostalgia.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brodesser-Akner|first=Claude|title=Why Do Studios Think There's So Much Value in Old Titles?| url=http://www.vulture.com/2011/08/conan_the_barbarian_fright_nig.html| work=Vulture| publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]| accessdate=2013-05-31| date=2011-08-19}}</ref>  Their popularity would bring some critics to proclaim the death of cult films now that they have finally become successful and mainstream,<ref name=who-killed /> are too slick to attract a proper cult following,<ref name=cult-dead /> lack context,<ref name=sconce /> or are too easily found online.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Brandon|title=The Internet and the Cult Film: On A Fan's Notes|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/65996-the-internet-and-the-cult-film-on-a-fans-notes/|work=Filmmaker|accessdate=2013-05-13|date=2013-04-04}}</ref>  In response, David Church says that cult film fans have retreated to more obscure and difficult to find films, often using illegal distribution methods, which preserves the outlaw status of cult films.  Virtual spaces, such as online forums and fan sites, replace the traditional [[fanzine]]s and newsletters.<ref name=cineaste />  Cult film fans consider themselves collectors, rather than consumers, as they associate consumers with mainstream, Hollywood audiences.<ref name=hollows />{{rp|46}}  This collecting can take the place of fetishization of a single film.<ref name=sconce />  Addressing concerns that DVDs have revoked the cult status of films like ''Rocky Horror'', academic Mikel J. Koven states that small scale screenings with friends and family can replace midnight showings.  Koven also identifies television shows, such as ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', as retaining more traditional cult activities inside popular culture.<ref name=cineaste />  [[David Lynch]] himself has not ruled out another television series, as studios have become reluctant to take chances on non-mainstream ideas.<ref>{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Tim|title=Waxing Lyrical: David Lynch on His New Passion - and Why He May Never Make Another Movie|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/waxing-lyrical-david-lynch-on-his-new-passion--and-why-he-may-never-make-another-movie-8665457.html|accessdate=2013-06-28|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=2013-06-23}}</ref>  Despite this, the [[Alamo Drafthouse]] has capitalized on cult films and the surrounding culture through inspiration drawn from ''Rocky Horror'' and retro promotional gimmickry.

I. Q. Hunter identifies a prefabricated cult film style which includes "deliberately, insulting bad films", "slick exercises in dysfunction and alienation", and mainstream films "that sell themselves as worth obsessing over".<ref name=cineaste />  Writing for [[NPR]], Scott Tobias states that [[Don Coscarelli]], whose previous films effortlessly attracted cult followings, has drifted into this realm.  Tobias criticizes Coscarelli as trying too hard to appeal to cult audiences and sacrificing internal consistency for calculated quirkiness.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tobias|first=Scott|title=Spoiler Alert: 'John Dies,' But The Rest?

''[[Snakes on a Plane]]'' (2006) is an example that attracted massive attention from curious fans.  Uniquely, its cult following preceded the film's release and included speculative parodies of what fans imagined the film might be.  This reached the point of [[technological convergence#Convergence culture|convergence culture]] when fan speculation began to impact on the film's production.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stevens|first=Kirsten|editor1-last=Cash|editor1-first=Conall|editor2-last=Snow|editor2-first=Samuel Cuff|title=Snakes on a Plane and the Prefabricated Cult Film|journal=Colloquy|year=2009|issue=18|url=http://artsonline.monash.edu.au/colloquy/download/colloquy_issue_eighteen/stevens.pdf|accessdate=2013-06-23|publisher=[[Monash University]]}}</ref>  Although it was proclaimed a cult film and major game-changer before it was released,<ref>{{cite news|last=Chonin|first=Neva|title='Snakes on a Plane' Blog Buzz Forces Hollywood into Overdue Attitude Adjustment|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Snakes-on-a-Plane-blog-buzz-forces-Hollywood-2533141.php|accessdate=2013-05-13|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=2006-06-12}}</ref> it failed to win either mainstream audiences or maintain its cult following.

Cult films are often approached in terms of [[auteur theory]], which states that the director's creative vision drives a film.  This has fallen out of favor in academia, creating a disconnect between cult film fans and critics.<ref name=hutchings />{{rp|135}}  Matt Hills states that auteur theory can help to create cult films; fans that see a film as continuing a director's creative vision are likely to accept it as cult.<ref name=cineaste />  According to academic Greg Taylor, auteur theory also helped to popularize cult films when middlebrow audiences found an accessible way to approach avant-garde film criticism.  Auteur theory provided an alternative culture for cult film fans while carrying the weight of scholarship.  By requiring repeated viewings and extensive knowledge of details, auteur theory naturally appealed to cult film fans.  Taylor further states that this was instrumental in allowing cult films to break through to the mainstream.<ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Greg|title=Artists in the Audience: Cults, Camp, and American Film Criticism|year=2001|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=978-0-691-08955-3|pages=87<U+2013>88|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fukKSOOc0dYC&pg=PA87}}</ref>  Academic Joe Tompkins states that this auteurism is often highlighted when mainstream success occurs.  This may take the place of <U+2013> and even ignore <U+2013> political readings of the director.  Cult films and directors may be celebrated for their transgressive content, daring, and independence, but Tompkins argues that mainstream recognition requires they be palatable to corporate interests who stand to gain much from the mainstreaming of cult film culture.  While critics may champion revolutionary aspects of filmmaking and political interpretation, Hollywood studios and other corporate interests will instead highlight only the aspects that they wish to legitimize in their own films, such as sensational exploitation.  Someone like [[George Romero]], whose films are both transgressive and subversive, will have the transgressive aspects highlighted while the subversive aspects are ignored.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tompkins|first=Joe|title="They Have the Oscars": Oppositional Telebranding and the Cult of the Horror Auteur|journal=[[Flow (journal)|Flow]]|date=2010-07-16|volume=12|issue=4|url=http://flowtv.org/2010/07/oppositional-telebranding-and-the-cult-of-the-horror-auteur/|accessdate=2013-06-21}}</ref>
