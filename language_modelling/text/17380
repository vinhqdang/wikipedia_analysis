A '''virus''' is a biological agent that [[reproduction|reproduces]] inside the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of living [[Host (biology)|hosts]]. When infected by a virus, a host cell is forced to produce many thousands of identical copies of the original virus, at an extraordinary rate. Unlike most living things, viruses do not have cells that divide; new viruses are assembled in the infected host cell. Over 2,000 species of viruses have been discovered.

A virus consists of two or three parts: [[gene]]s, made from either [[DNA]] or [[RNA]], long [[molecule]]s that carry the genetic information; a [[protein]] coat that protects the genes; and in some viruses, an [[viral envelope|envelope]] of fat that surrounds and protects them when they are not contained within a host cell. Viruses vary in shape from the simple [[tobacco mosaic virus|helical]] and [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] to more [[bacteriophage|complex]] structures. Viruses are about 100 times smaller than [[bacteria]], it would take 30,000 to 750,000 of them, side by side, to stretch to {{convert|1|cm}}.

Viruses spread in many different ways. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other [[organism]]s, known as [[Vector (epidemiology)|''vector'']]s. Some viruses of animals are spread by blood-sucking insects. Each [[species]] of virus relies on a particular method. Whereas viruses such as [[influenza]] are spread through the air by people when they cough or sneeze, others such as [[norovirus]], which are transmitted by the [[fecal-oral route|faecal-oral route]], contaminate hands, food and water. [[Rotavirus]] is often spread by direct contact with infected children. The human immunodeficiency virus, [[HIV]], is one of several major viruses that are transmitted during sex. The origins of viruses is unclear: some may have [[evolution|evolved]] from [[plasmid]]s<U+2014>pieces of DNA that can move between cells, while others may have evolved from bacteria.

Viral infections often cause disease in humans and animals, however they are usually eliminated by the [[immune system]], conferring lifetime [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] to the host for that virus. [[Antibiotic]]s have no effect on viruses, but [[antiviral drug]]s have been developed to treat life-threatening infections. [[Vaccine]]s that produce lifelong immunity can prevent some viral infections.

==Discovery==
{{Main|History of viruses}}
[[File:HIV-budding-Color cropped.jpg|left|thumbnail|[[Scanning electron microscope|Scanning electron micrograph]] of HIV-1 viruses, coloured green, budding from a [[lymphocyte]]]]

In 1884 the French [[microbiologist]] [[Charles Chamberland]] invented a filter, (known today as the [[Chamberland filter]] or Chamberland-Pasteur filter), that has pores smaller than bacteria. Thus he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them from the solution.<ref>Shors pp. 76<U+2013>77</ref> In the early 1890s the Russian [[biologist]] [[Dimitri Ivanovski]] used this filter to study what became known as the [[tobacco mosaic virus]]. His experiments showed that extracts from the crushed leaves of infected tobacco-plants remain infectious after filtration.

At the same time several other scientists proved that, although these agents (later called ''viruses'') were different from bacteria, they could still cause disease, and they were about a hundred times smaller than bacteria. In 1899 The Dutch microbiologist [[Martinus Beijerinck]] observed that the agent multiplied only in dividing cells. Having failed to demonstrate its particulate nature he called it a "contagium vivum fluidum" to mean "soluble living germ".<ref>Topley and Wilson p. 3</ref> In the early 20th century the English [[bacteriologist]] [[Frederick Twort]] discovered viruses that infect bacteria,<ref>Shors p. 589</ref> and the French-Canadian microbiologist [[F<U+00E9>lix d'Herelle]] described viruses that, when added to bacteria growing on [[agar]], would lead to the formation of whole areas of dead bacteria. Counting these dead areas allowed him to calculate the number of viruses in the suspension.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = D'herelle | first1 = F | title = On an invisible microbe antagonistic toward dysenteric bacilli: brief note by Mr. F.

With the invention of the [[electron microscope]] in 1931 by the German engineers [[Ernst Ruska]] and [[Max Knoll]] came the first images of viruses.<ref>From ''Nobel Lectures, Physics 1981<U+2013>1990'', (1993) Editor-in-Charge Tore Fr<U+00E4>ngsmyr, Editor G<U+00F6>sta Eksp<U+00E5>ng, World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore</ref> In 1935 American [[biochemist]] and [[virologist]] [[Wendell Meredith Stanley]] examined the tobacco mosaic virus and found it to be mostly made from protein.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Stanley | first1 = W.M. | last2 = Loring | first2 = H.S. | year = 1936 | title = The isolation of crystalline tobacco mosaic virus protein from diseased tomato plants | url = | journal = Science | volume = 83 | issue = 2143| page = 85 | pmid = 17756690 | doi = 10.1126/science.83.2143.85 }}</ref> A short time later, this virus was separated into protein and RNA parts.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.89.2311.345 | last1 = Stanley | first1 = W.M. | last2 = Lauffer | first2 = M.A. | year = 1939 | title = Disintegration of tobacco mosaic virus in urea solutions | url = | journal = Science | volume = 89 | issue = 2311| pages = 345<U+2013>347 | pmid = 17788438 }}</ref> A problem for early scientists was that they did not know how to grow viruses without using live animals.

==Origins==

Viruses are found wherever there is life and have probably existed since living cells first evolved. The origin of viruses is unclear because they do not form fossils, so [[Molecular biology|molecular techniques]] have been the most useful means of hypothesising how they arose. However, these techniques rely on the availability of ancient viral DNA or RNA but most of the viruses that have been preserved and stored in laboratories are less than 90 years old.<ref>Shors. p. 16</ref><ref>Topley and Wilson pp. 18<U+2013>19</ref> Molecular methods have only been successful in tracing the ancestry of viruses that evolved in the 20th century.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = Y | last2 = Nickle | first2 = DC | last3 = Shriner | first3 = D | last4 = Jensen | first4 = MA | last5 = Learn Jr | first5 = GH | last6 = Mittler | first6 = JE | last7 = Mullins | first7 = JI | title = Molecular clock-like evolution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1. | journal = Virology | volume = 329 | issue = 1 | pages = 101<U+2013>8 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15476878 | doi = 10.1016/j.virol.2004.08.014 }}</ref>

There are three main theories of the origins of viruses:<ref>Shors pp. 14<U+2013>16</ref><ref>Topley and Wilson pp.11<U+2013>21</ref>

; Regressive theory : Viruses may have once been small cells that [[parasitism|parasitised]] larger cells. Over time, genes not required by their parasitism were lost. The bacteria [[rickettsia]] and [[Chlamydia (bacterium)|chlamydia]] are living cells that, like viruses, can reproduce only inside host cells. They lend credence to this theory, as their dependence on parasitism is likely to have caused the loss of genes that enabled them to survive outside a cell.<ref>Topley and Wilson p. 11</ref>

; Cellular origin theory : Some viruses may have evolved from bits of DNA or RNA that "escaped" from the genes of a larger organism. The escaped DNA could have come from [[plasmid]]s<U+2014>pieces of DNA that can move between cells<U+2014>while others may have evolved from bacteria.<ref>Topley and Wilson pp. 11<U+2013>12</ref>

; Coevolution theory : Viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and DNA at the same time as cells first appeared on earth and would have been dependent on cellular life for many millions of years.

==Structure==

[[File:Virus stucture simple.png|thumb|250px|A simplified diagram of the structure of a virus]]

A virus particle, known as a [[virion]], consists of genes made from DNA or RNA which are surrounded by a protective coat of protein called a [[capsid]].<ref name="Topley-and-Wilson33-55">Topley and Wilson pp. 33<U+2013>55</ref> The capsid is made of many smaller, identical protein molecules which are called capsomers. The arrangement of the capsomers can either be [[truncated icosahedron|icosahedral]] (20-sided), [[helix|helical]] or more complex. There is an inner shell around the DNA or RNA called the [[nucleocapsid]], which is formed by proteins. Some viruses are surrounded by a bubble of [[lipid]] (fat) called an [[viral envelope|envelope]].

===Size===

Viruses are among the smallest infectious agents, and most of them can only be seen by [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]]. Most viruses cannot be seen by light microscopy (in other words, they are [[Optical microscope#Limitations|sub-microscopic]]); their sizes range from 20 to 300&nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]]. They are so small that it would take 30,000 to 750,000 of them, side by side, to stretch to one cm.<ref name="Topley-and-Wilson33-55"/>

===Genes===

{{details|Introduction to genetics}}

Genes are made from DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and, in many viruses, RNA (ribonucleic acid). The biological information contained in an organism is [[Genetic code|encoded]] in its DNA or RNA. Most organisms use DNA, but [[RNA virus|many viruses]] have RNA as their genetic material. The DNA or RNA of viruses consists of either a single strand or a double helix.<ref>Shors pp. 54<U+2013>61</ref>

Viruses reproduce rapidly because they have only a few genes compared to humans who have 20,000<U+2013>25,000.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature03001 | last1 = International Human | first1 = Genome Sequencing Consortium | year = 2004 | title = Finishing the euchromatic sequence of the human genome | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 431 | issue = 7011| pages = 931<U+2013>945 | pmid = 15496913 }}</ref> For example, influenza virus has only eight genes and [[rotavirus]] has eleven. These genes encode structural proteins that form the virus particle, or non-structural proteins, that are only found in cells infected by the virus.<ref>Shors p. 73</ref>

All cells, and many viruses, produce proteins that are [[enzyme]]s called [[DNA polymerase]] and [[RNA polymerase]] which make new copies of DNA and RNA. A virus's polymerase enzymes are often much more efficient at making DNA and RNA than the host cell's.<ref>Shors pp. 32<U+2013>34</ref> However, RNA polymerase enzymes often make mistakes, and this is one of the reasons why RNA viruses often mutate to form new strains.<ref>Shors p. 510</ref>

In some species of RNA virus, the genes are not on a continuous molecule of RNA, but are separated. The influenza virus, for example, has eight separate genes made of RNA. When two different strains of influenza virus infect the same cell, these genes can mix and produce new strains of the virus in a process called [[reassortment]].<ref>Shors p. 327</ref>

===Protein synthesis===

[[File:Cell with Virus.png|thumb|275px|Diagram of a typical [[eukaryotic]] cell, showing subcellular components. [[Organelle]]s: (1) [[nucleolus]] (2) [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] (3) [[ribosome]] (4) [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]] (5) rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER) (6) [[Golgi apparatus]] (7) [[Cytoskeleton]] (8) smooth ER (9) [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] (10) [[vacuole]] (11) [[cytoplasm]] (12) [[lysosome]] (13) [[centriole]]s within [[centrosome]] (14) [[virus]] particle shown to approximate scale]]

Proteins are essential to life. Cells produce new protein molecules from [[amino acid]] building blocks based on information coded in DNA. Each type of protein is a specialist that only performs one function, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein. Viruses force the cell to make new proteins that the cell does not need, but are needed for the virus to reproduce. [[Protein biosynthesis|Protein synthesis]] basically consists of two major steps: [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]].

Transcription is the process where information in DNA, called the [[genetic code]], is used to produce RNA copies called [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA). These migrate through the cell and carry the code to [[ribosome]]s where it is used to make proteins. This is called translation because the protein's [[amino acid]] structure is determined by the mRNA's code. Information is hence translated from the language of nucleic acids to the language of amino acids.

Some RNA genes of viruses function directly as mRNA without further modification. For this reason, these viruses are called positive-sense RNA viruses.<ref>Topley and Wilson pp. 75<U+2013>82</ref> In other RNA viruses, the RNA is a complementary copy of mRNA and these viruses rely on the cell's or their own enzyme to make mRNA. These are called [[Sense (molecular biology)|negative-sense]] RNA viruses. In viruses made from DNA, the method of mRNA production is similar to that of the cell. The species of viruses called [[retrovirus]]es behave completely differently: they have RNA, but inside the host cell a DNA copy of their RNA is made with the help of the enzyme reverse transcriptase. This DNA is then incorporated into the host's, and copied into mRNA by the cell's normal pathways.<ref>Shors pp. 248<U+2013>250</ref>

==Life-cycle==

{{main|Viral life cycle|Viral entry}}

[[File:HepC replication.png|thumb|Life-cycle of a typical virus, following infection of a cell by a single virus, hundreds of offspring are released]]

When a virus infects a cell, the virus forces it to make thousands more viruses. It does this by making the cell copy the virus's DNA or RNA, making viral proteins, which all assemble to form new virus particles.<ref>Shors pp. 11<U+2013>12</ref>

There are six basic, overlapping stages in the life cycle of viruses in living cells:<ref>Shors pp. 47<U+2013>67</ref>

*'''Attachment''' is the binding of the virus to specific molecules on the surface of the cell. This specificity restricts the virus to a very limited type of cell. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects only human [[T cell]]s, because its surface protein, [[gp120]], can only react with [[CD4]] and other molecules on the T cell's surface. Plant viruses can only attach to plant cells and cannot infect animals. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells in which they are capable of reproducing.
*'''Penetration''' follows attachment; viruses penetrate the host cell by [[endocytosis]] or by fusion with the cell.
*'''Uncoating''' happens inside the cell when the viral capsid is removed and destroyed by viral enzymes or host enzymes, thereby exposing the viral nucleic acid.
*'''Replication''' of virus particles is the stage where a cell uses viral messenger RNA in its protein synthesis systems to produce viral proteins. The RNA or DNA synthesis abilities of the cell produce the virus's DNA or RNA.
*'''Assembly''' takes place in the cell when the newly created viral proteins and nucleic acid combine to form hundreds of new virus particles.
*'''Release''' occurs when the new viruses escape or are released from the cell. Most viruses achieve this by making the cells burst, a process called [[lysis]]. Other viruses such as HIV are released more gently by a process called [[viral shedding#Via budding|budding]].

==Effects on the host cell==

The range of structural and biochemical effects that viruses have on the host cell is extensive.<ref>Collier pp. 115<U+2013>146</ref> These are called ''cytopathic effects''.<ref>Collier p. 115</ref> Most virus infections eventually result in the death of the host cell. The causes of death include cell lysis (bursting), alterations to the cell's surface membrane and [[apoptosis]] (cell "suicide").<ref name="pmid10547702">{{cite journal

When a cell's DNA is damaged by a virus and if the cell cannot [[DNA repair|repair]] this often triggers apoptosis. One of the results of apoptosis is destruction of the damaged DNA by the cell itself. Some viruses have mechanisms to limit apoptosis so that the host cell does not die before progeny viruses have been produced. [[HIV]], for example, does this.<ref name="pmid10547702"/>

==Viruses and diseases==

{{for|more examples of diseases caused by viruses|List of infectious diseases}}

[[File:Norwalk.jpg|thumb|125px|[[Norovirus]]. Ten Norovirus particles; this RNA virus causes winter vomiting disease. It is often in the news as a cause of gastro-enteritis on cruise ships and in hospitals.]]

Common human diseases caused by viruses include the [[common cold]], [[influenza|the flu]], [[chickenpox]] and [[cold sores]]. Serious diseases such as [[Ebola]] and [[AIDS]] are also caused by viruses. Many viruses cause little or no disease and are said to be "benign". The more harmful viruses are described as [[virulence|virulent]].
Viruses cause different diseases depending on the types of cell that they infect.
Some viruses can cause life-long or [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] infections where the viruses continue to reproduce in the body despite the host's defence mechanisms.<ref>Shors p. 483</ref> This is common in [[hepatitis B virus]] and [[hepatitis C virus]] infections. People chronically infected with a virus are known as carriers. They serve as important reservoirs of the virus. If there is a high proportion of carriers in a given population, a disease is said to be [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]].<ref>Topley and Wilson p. 766</ref>

There are many ways in which viruses spread from host to host but each species of virus uses only one or two. Many viruses that infect plants are carried by [[organism]]s; such organisms are called [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s. Some viruses that infect animals and humans are also spread by vectors, usually blood-sucking insects. However, direct animal-to-animal, person-to-person or animal-to-person transmission is more common. Some virus infections, ([[norovirus]] and [[rotavirus]]), are spread by contaminated food and water, hands and communal [[fomites|objects]] and by intimate contact with another infected person,<ref>Shors p. 118</ref> while others are airborne (influenza virus).<ref>Shors p.117</ref> Viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are often transmitted by unprotected sex<ref>Shors p. 119</ref> or contaminated [[hypodermic needle]]s.<ref>Shors p.123</ref> It is important to know how each different kind of virus is spread to prevent infections and epidemics.<ref>Shors pp. 16<U+2013>19</ref>

===Diseases of plants===

{{Main|Plant Pathology}}

[[File:Pepper mild mottle virus.png|thumb|125px|[[Capsicum|Pepper]]s infected by mild mottle virus]]

There are many types of [[plant virus]], but often they only cause a loss of [[crop yield|yield]], and it is not economically viable to try to control them. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by [[organism]]s ([[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s). These are normally insects, but some [[fungi]], [[Nematode|nematode worms]] and [[protozoa|single-celled organisms]] have been shown to be vectors. When control of plant virus infections is considered economical, (for perennial fruits for example), efforts are concentrated on killing the vectors and removing alternate hosts such as weeds.<ref>Shors p. 584</ref> Plant viruses are harmless to humans and other animals because they can only reproduce in living plant cells.<ref>Shors pp. 562<U+2013>587</ref>

===Bacteriophages===

{{main|Bacteriophage}}

[[File:PhageExterior.svg|thumb|The structure of a typical bacteriophage]]

Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria. There are over 5,100 types of bacteriophages. They are important in [[marine ecology]]: as the infected bacteria burst, carbon compounds are released back into the environment, which stimulates fresh organic growth. Bacteriophages are useful in scientific research because they are harmless to humans and can be studied easily. These viruses can be a problem in industries that produce food and drugs by [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] and depend on healthy bacteria. Some bacterial infections are becoming difficult to control with antibiotics, so there is a growing interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat infections in humans.<ref>Shors pp. 588<U+2013>604</ref>

===Host resistance===
====Innate immunity of animals====

{{Main|Innate immunity}}

Animals, including humans, have many natural defences against viruses. Some are non-specific and protect against many viruses regardless of the type. This [[innate]] immunity is not improved by repeated exposure to viruses and does not retain a "memory" of the infection. The skin of animals, particularly its surface, which is made from dead cells, prevents many types of viruses from infecting the host. The acidity of the contents of the stomach kills many viruses that have been swallowed. When a virus overcomes these barriers and enters the host, other innate defences prevent the spread of infection in the body. A special hormone called [[interferon]] is produced by the body when viruses are present, and this stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the infected cell and its close neighbours. Inside cells, there are enzymes that destroy the RNA of viruses. This is called [[RNA interference]]. Some blood cells [[phagocytosis|engulf]] and destroy other virus infected cells.<ref>Shors pp. 146<U+2013>158</ref>

====Adaptive immunity of animals====

{{main|Immune response}}

[[File:Rotavirus with antibody.jpg|thumb|Two rotavirus particles: the one on the right is coated with antibodies which stop its attaching to cells and infecting them]]

Specific immunity to viruses develops over time and white blood cells called [[lymphocyte]]s play a central role. Lymphocytes retain a "memory" of virus infections and produce many special molecules called [[antibody|antibodies]]. These antibodies attach to viruses and stop the virus from infecting cells. Antibodies are highly selective and attack only one type of virus. The body makes many different antibodies, especially during the initial infection, however, after the infection subsides, some antibodies remain and continue to be produced, often giving the host life-long immunity to the virus.<ref>Shors pp.158<U+2013>168</ref>

====Plant resistance====

Plants have elaborate and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One of the most effective is the presence of so-called [[Gene-for-gene_relationship#Classes_of_Resistance_Gene|resistance (R) genes]]. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.97.26.14789 | last1 = Dinesh-Kumar | first1 = S.P. | last2 = Tham | first2 = Hong | last3 = -1#Wai- | first3 = Baker | year = 2000 | title = Structure<U+2014>function analysis of the tobacco mosaic virus resistance gene N | url = | journal = PNAS | volume = 97 | issue = 26| pages = 14789<U+2013>94 | pmid = 11121079 | pmc = 18997 }}</ref> RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants.<ref>Shors pp. 573<U+2013>576; {{cite doi|10.1016/j.cell.2007.07.039}} PMID 17693253</ref> When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants which kill viruses, such as [[salicylic acid]], [[nitric oxide]] and [[Reactive oxygen species|reactive oxygen molecules]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro1239 | last1 = Soosaar | first1 = J.L. | last2 = Burch-Smith | first2 = T.M. | last3 = Dinesh-Kumar | first3 = S.P. | year = 2005 | title = Mechanisms of plant resistance to viruses | url = | journal = Nat.

====Resistance to bacteriophages====

The major way bacteria defend themselves from bacteriophages is by producing enzymes which destroy foreign DNA. These enzymes, called [[restriction endonucleases]], cut up the viral DNA that bacteriophages inject into bacterial cells.

Vaccination is a way of preventing diseases caused by viruses. Vaccines simulate a natural infection and its associated immune response, but do not cause the disease. Their use has resulted in a dramatic decline in illness and death caused by infections such as [[polio]], [[measles]], [[mumps]] and [[rubella]].<ref>Shors pp. 171<U+2013>185</ref> Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans<ref>Shors p. 183</ref> and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pastoret | first1 = P.P. | last2 = Schudel | first2 = A.A. | last3 = Lombard | first3 = M. | year = 2007 | title = Conclusions<U+2014>future trends in veterinary vaccinology | url = | journal = Rev.

Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine.<ref>Shors p. 174</ref> These vaccines are safer because they can never cause the disease.<ref>Shors p. 180</ref>

====Antiviral drugs====

{{main|Antiviral drug}}

Over the past 20 years, the development of [[antiviral drug]]s has increased rapidly, mainly driven by the AIDS [[pandemic]]. Antiviral drugs are often [[nucleoside analogue]]s, which are molecules very similar, but not identical to DNA building blocks. When the replication of virus DNA begins, some of these fake building blocks are incorporated. As soon as that happens, replication stops prematurely<U+2014>the fake building blocks lack the essential features that allow the addition of further building blocks. Thus, DNA production is halted, and the virus can no longer reproduce.<ref>Shors p. 427</ref> Examples of nucleoside analogues are [[aciclovir]] for [[Herpesviridae|herpes virus]] infections and [[lamivudine]] for HIV and [[hepatitis B virus]] infections. Aciclovir is one of the oldest and most frequently prescribed antiviral drugs.<ref>Shors p. 426</ref>

[[File:Aciclovir.svg|thumb|100px|The [[guanine]] analogue [[aciclovir]]]]

Other antiviral drugs target different stages of the viral life cycle. HIV is dependent on an enzyme called the [[HIV-1 protease]] for the virus to become infectious. There is a class of drugs called [[protease inhibitors]], which bind to this enzyme and stop it from functioning.<ref name="Shors p. 463">Shors p. 463</ref>

Hepatitis C is caused by an RNA virus. In 80% of people infected, the disease becomes [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]], and they remain infectious for the rest of their lives unless they are treated. There is an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug [[ribavirin]] combined with interferon.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2893.2007.00871.x | last1 = Witthoft | first1 = T. | last2 = Moller | first2 = B. | last3 = Wiedmann | first3 = K.H. | last4 = Mauss | first4 = S. | last5 = Link | first5 = R. | last6 = Lohmeyer | first6 = J. | last7 = Lafrenz | first7 = M. | last8 = Gelbmann | first8 = C.M. | last9 = Huppe | first9 = D.

HIV infections are usually treated with a combination of antiviral drugs, each targeting a different stage in the virus's life-cycle. There are drugs that prevent the virus from attaching to cells, others that are nucleoside analogues and some poison the virus's enzymes that it needs to reproduce.<ref name="Shors p. 463"/> The success of these drugs is proof of the importance of knowing how viruses reproduce.

==Role in ecology==
Viruses are the most abundant biological entity in aquatic environments<ref name="pmid16984643">{{cite journal |author=Koonin EV, Senkevich TG, Dolja VV |title=The ancient Virus World and evolution of cells |journal=Biology Direct |volume=1 |issue= 1|pages=29 |year=2006 |pmid=16984643 |pmc=1594570 |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-1-29}}</ref><U+2014>there are about one million of them in a teaspoon of seawater<ref>Shors p. 4</ref><U+2014>and they are essential to the regulation of saltwater and freshwater ecosystems.<ref>Shors p. 5</ref> Most of these viruses are bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals. They infect and destroy the bacteria in aquatic microbial communities and this is the most important mechanism of recycling carbon in the marine environment. The organic molecules released from the bacterial cells by the viruses stimulates fresh bacterial and algal growth.<ref>Shors p. 593</ref> 

Microorganisms constitute more than 90% of the biomass in the sea. It is estimated that viruses kill approximately 20% of this biomass each day and that there are fifteen times as many viruses in the oceans as there are bacteria and archaea. Viruses are mainly responsible for the rapid destruction of harmful [[algal bloom]]s,<ref name="pmid16163346">{{cite journal |author=Suttle CA |title=Viruses in the sea |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7057 |pages=356<U+2013>61 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16163346 |doi=10.1038/nature04160}}</ref> which often kill other marine life.<ref>

The number of viruses in the oceans decreases further offshore and deeper into the water, where there are fewer host organisms.<ref name="pmid17853907">{{cite journal |author=Suttle CA |title=Marine viruses--major players in the global ecosystem |journal=Nature Reviews.

Their effects are far-reaching; by increasing the amount of respiration in the oceans, viruses are indirectly responsible for reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by approximately 3 [[gigatonne]]s of carbon per year.<ref name="pmid17853907"/>

Marine mammals are also susceptible to viral infections. In 1988 and 2002 thousands of harbour seals  were killed in Europe by [[phocine distemper virus]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1= Hall | first1= A | last2= Jepson | first2= P | last3= Goodman | first3= S | last4= Harkonen | first4= T | title= Phocine distemper virus in the North and European Seas <U+2013> Data and models, nature and nurture | journal= Biological Conservation | volume= 131 | issue= 2 | pages= 221<U+2013>229 | year= 2006 |doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2006.04.008 }}</ref> Many other viruses, including caliciviruses, herpesviruses, adenoviruses and parvoviruses, circulate in marine mammal populations.<ref name="pmid17853907"/>
