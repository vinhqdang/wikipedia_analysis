== Production ==
=== Conception ===
The series began development in January 2004, when [[Lloyd Braun (media executive)|Lloyd Braun]], head of ABC at the time, ordered an initial script based on his concept of a cross between the movie ''[[Cast Away]]'' and the popular reality show ''[[Survivor]]''. Unhappy with the result and a subsequent re-write, Braun contacted J.J. Abrams, creator of the TV series ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', to write a new pilot script. Although initially hesitant, Abrams warmed to it, and eventually collaborated with Damon Lindelof to create the series' style and characters.<ref name="DT081405">

Despite the short schedule, the creative team remained flexible enough to modify or create characters to fit actors they wished to cast.<ref name=season1dvd>Abrams, J. J and Lloyd Braun, ''Lost Season 1 DVD'' (extras), Buena Vista Home Entertainment, 6 September, 2005.</ref>

''Lost'''s two-part [[pilot episode]] was the most expensive in the network's history, reportedly costing between [[United States dollar|US$]]10 and US$14 million,<ref>{{cite news|title=New series gives Hawaii 3 TV shows in production| last=Ryan|first=Tim|url=http://starbulletin.com/2004/05/17/news/story7.html|publisher=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|date=May 17, 2004}}</ref> compared to the average cost of an hour-long pilot in 2005 of US$4 million.<ref name="EIDC050405">{{cite press release

Along with fellow new series ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'', ''Lost'' helped to reverse the flagging fortunes of ABC.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bianco|first=Robert|title=A good season, with reason|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-04-26-tv-lookback_x.htm|publisher=USA Today|date=26 April, 2005}}</ref> Yet, before it had even aired, Lloyd Braun was [[Termination of employment|fired]] by executives at ABC's parent company, [[Disney]], because he had [[greenlight]]ed such an expensive and risky project.<ref name="DT081405" />

===Episode format===
[[Image:Lost title card.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Lost's title card.]]
Episodes have a distinct structure: following a recap of events relevant to the upcoming narrative, each show begins with a [[cold open]].  At a dramatic juncture, the screen cuts to black and the title [[graphic]], slightly out-of-focus, glides towards the viewer accompanied by an ominous, discordant sound. The [[opening credits]] generally appear alphabetically by last name over the scenes that immediately follow. While there is a progressive [[story arc]], each episode relates events concurrently with pre-island [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]]s centered on a particular character. The majority of episodes end with a suspenseful [[twist ending|twist]] or [[cliffhanger]], revealed just seconds before a [[smash cut]] to black and the title graphic. Others, following a plot resolution, will finish with a reflective closing scene that precedes a simple [[fade to black|fade out]].  Shortly afterwards, a preview of out-of-sequence clips from the next episode is shown.

===Music===
{{main|List of songs featured on Lost}}

''Lost'' features [[incidental music]] composed by Michael Giacchino, whose score is primarily orchestral and incorporates several recurring themes for events and characters. The score is performed by the [[Hollywood Studio Symphony Orchestra]]. In the official Lost Podcast, Michael Giacchino revealed that he achieved some of the sounds for the score using unusual instruments, such as striking suspended pieces of the plane's [[fuselage]].<ref>Official Lost Podcast [http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/podcasts/101323.html "Official Lost Podcast"] 9 January 2006.</ref>

On [[March 21]], [[2006]], the record label [[Var<U+00E8>se Sarabande]] released the original television [[soundtrack]] for ''Lost'''s first season. The soundtrack included select full-length versions of the most popular themes of the season and the main title which was composed by series creator J.J. Abrams. Var<U+00E8>se Sarabande released a soundtrack featuring music from the second season of ''Lost'' on [[October 3]], [[2006]].<ref>http://www.varesesarabande.com/upcoming.asp</ref>

Pop culture songs have been used sparingly in the series, given the mainly orchestral score. When such songs are featured, they usually originate from a [[Diegesis#Film sound and music|diegetic]] source, meaning that they are usually generated by an action of one of the characters. Examples are the various songs played on Hurley's portable CD player throughout the first season or the use of the record player (which included [[Cass Elliot|Cass Elliot's]] "[[Make Your Own Kind of Music]]" in the second season premiere and [[Petula Clark|Petula Clark's]] "[[Downtown]]" in the third season premiere).

In some international broadcasts, alternate music is utilized. For instance, in the [[Japan|Japanese]] broadcast of Lost, Season 1's [[Theme music|theme song]] is "Here I am" by [[Chemistry (band)|Chemistry]] and Season 2's theme song is "[[losin']]" by [[Yuna Ito]].

=== Filming locations ===
''Lost'' is filmed ([[35mm]]) almost entirely on the Hawaiian island of [[Oahu]]. The original island scenes for the pilot were filmed at [[Mokul<U+0113>'ia, Hawai'i|Mokul<U+0113>{{okina}}ia]] Beach, near the northwest tip of the island. Later beach scenes take place in secluded spots of the famous [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]]. Cave scenes in the first season were filmed on a [[sound stage]] built at a [[Xerox]] parts warehouse, which had been empty since an [[Byran Uyesugi|employee mass shooting]] took place there in 1999.<ref>{{cite news|last=Veitch|first=Kristin|title=Lost Secrets Found!|url=http://www.eonline.com/Gossip/Kristin/Archive2004/041016.html|publisher=[[E! Online]]|date=Oct. 16, 2004}}</ref> The soundstage and [[Film production|production]] offices have since moved to the Hawaii Film Office-operated Hawaii Film Studio,<ref>{{cite news|last=Nichols|first=Katherine|title=<U+2018>Lost<U+2019> Home|publisher=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]|url=http://starbulletin.com/2006/05/21/features/story01.html|date=May 21, 2006}}</ref> at which the sets depicting Season 2's "Swan station" and Season 3's "Hydra station" interiors were built.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ryan|first=Tim|title=Reel News|url=http://starbulletin.com/2005/08/24/features/ryan.html|publisher=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]|date=August 24, 2005}}</ref>
Various urban areas in and around [[Honolulu]] are used as stand-ins for locations around the world, including [[Los Angeles]], [[New York]], [[Iowa]], [[South Korea]], [[Iraq]], [[Nigeria]], [[England]], and [[Australia]]. For example, scenes set in a [[Kingsford Smith International Airport|Sydney airport]] were filmed at the [[Hawaii Convention Center]], while a [[World War II]]-era bunker was used as an [[Iraqi Republican Guard]] installation.<ref>{{cite news|last=Godvin|first=Tara|title=Oahu plays the world|publisher=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]|url=http://starbulletin.com/2005/05/25/features/story4.html|date=May 25, 2005}}</ref> Extensive archives of filming locations are tracked at a repository at [http://www.lostvirtualtour.com/ Lostvirtualtour.com].

=== Online distribution ===
In addition to traditional terrestrial and satellite broadcasting, ''Lost'' has been at the forefront of new television distribution methods.  It was one of the first series issued through [[Apple Computer|Apple's]] [[iTunes Store]] service for playback on an [[iPod]] or within the [[iTunes]] software. Since October 2005, new episodes, without commercials, have been available for download the day after they air on ABC.

In April 2006, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] announced that ''Lost'' would be available for free online in streaming format, with advertising, on ABC's website, as part of a two-month experiment of future distribution strategies. The trial, which ran from May to June 2006, caused a stir among network affiliates who were afraid of being cut out of advertising revenue. The streaming of ''Lost'' episodes direct from ABC's website was only available to viewers in the United States due to international licensing agreements.<ref>{{cite news| first=Joshua| last=Chaffin| coauthor= Aline van Duyn|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/341d65ba-c894-11da-b642-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=f5f96136-709f-11da-89d3-0000779e2340,print=yes.html| title=Disney<U+2019>s ABC to offer TV shows free on web | publisher=Financial Times|date=2006-04-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|publisher=DisneyABC TV|date=2006-04-10|url=http://www.disneyabctv.com/datvg_press/dispDNR.html?id=041006_06|title=Disney-ABC Television Group takes ABC Primetime Online}}</ref>

The UK's [[Channel 4]] has also allowed access to the series online.<ref>Channel 4 Lost Episodes Online [http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/L/lost/vod/index.html Channel 4]</ref> Both parts of "Pilot" were available to watch for free, and other episodes cost [[Pound sterling|GB<U+00A3>]]0.99 each. Season two installments are made available two weeks after their Channel 4 debut, and the episodes expire after several months. Due to licensing agreements, the service is only accessible in the UK. Channel 4 have now teamed up with NTL & Telewest's On Demand function which allows the viewer to watch shows at any time. Select episodes from Season One and Season two are available to view for 24 hour rental for <U+00A3>0.99 although the list of episodes is not complete. 

As of third quarter, 2006, France's [[TF1]] has allowed online access to the French version of season two; episodes cost  [[Euro|<U+20AC>]]1.99.<ref>{{cite web|title=TF1 Lost Episodes Online (French)|url=http://www.tf1vision.com/liste.php?rub=CAT8&fltCode=182&p=53/?trk=1&e=7}}</ref> Each episode is issued online just after being broadcast.

== Cast and characters ==
{{main|Characters of Lost}}
The opening season featured sixteen regular speaking roles, making it the second largest cast in American primetime television behind ''Desperate Housewives''. While a large cast makes ''Lost'' more expensive to produce, the show's writers benefit from more flexibility in story decisions. According to series executive producer Bryan Burk, "You can have more interactions between characters and create more diverse characters, more back stories, more love triangles."<ref>{{cite news|title=TV hits maximum occupancy|publisher=USA Today|last=Keveney|first=Bill|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-11-08-ensemble-casts_x.htm|date=08-11-2005}}</ref>

The initial season had fourteen major roles getting star [[billing (film)|billing]]. [[Naveen Andrews]] portrayed former Iraqi Republican guard [[Sayid Jarrah]]. [[Emilie de Ravin]] played the pregnant Australian [[Claire Littleton]]. [[Matthew Fox (actor)|Matthew Fox]] acted as the troubled surgeon and lead role [[Jack Shephard]]. [[Jorge Garcia]] portrayed [[Hugo "Hurley" Reyes]], an unlucky lotto winner. [[Maggie Grace]] played [[Shannon Rutherford]], a former dance teacher. [[Josh Holloway]] acted as con man [[James "Sawyer" Ford]]. [[Yunjin Kim]] played [[Sun-Hwa Kwon]], the daughter of a powerful Korean businessman, with [[Daniel Dae Kim]] as her husband [[Jin-Soo Kwon]]. [[Evangeline Lilly]] portrayed fugitive [[Kate Austen]]. [[Dominic Monaghan]] acted as an ex-rock star drug addict [[Charlie Pace]]. [[Terry O'Quinn]] played the mysterious [[John Locke (Lost)|John Locke]].

[[Ian Somerhalder]] played [[Boone Carlyle]], chief operating officer of his mother's wedding business and step brother of Shannon.

During the first two seasons, some characters were written out to make room for new characters with new stories.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-09-13-lost_x.htm|publisher=USA Today|last= Keck|first=William |date=13-09-2005|title='Lost' in the face of death}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comic-con.org/cci/cci06prog_lost.shtml|publisher=Comic Con|title=Interview with Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse|quote="Carton: There will always be new characters that will be joining the cast of Lost. We will try to give the audience a lot of stuff with your favorite characters and introducing new characters and evolving the story is just part of the DNA of the show."}}</ref> Boone Carlyle was the first major character to be written out in season one. Malcolm David Kelley became a guest star after the events of the first season's finale, making rare appearances throughout season two. Maggie Grace's departure six episodes into season two made way for newcomers [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]] as Catholic priest and former Nigerian criminal [[Eko (Lost)|Eko]], [[Michelle Rodriguez]] as airport security guard and former police officer [[Ana Lucia Cortez]], and [[Cynthia Watros]] portraying the purported clinical psychologist [[Libby (Lost)|Libby]]. Ana Lucia and Libby were written out of the series toward the end of season two, as were Michael and Walt.

In season three, [[Henry Ian Cusick]] received star billing as former Scottish soldier [[Desmond David Hume]], as did [[Michael Emerson]] in the role of [[Benjamin Linus]] (formerly known as Henry Gale), the possible leader of the "[[Others (Lost)|Others]]." In addition, three new actors joined the regular cast: [[Elizabeth Mitchell]], as [[Juliet (Lost)|Juliet]], [[Kiele Sanchez]] who plays [[Nikki (Lost)|Nikki]], and [[Rodrigo Santoro]], who plays [[Paulo (Lost)|Paulo]]. With these additions, however, Mr. Eko was written out early in the season.

Numerous supporting characters have been given expansive and recurring appearances in the progressive storyline. In the second season, [[Rose Henderson]] played by [[L. Scott Caldwell]] and tail section survivor [[Bernard Nadler]]  played by [[Sam Anderson]], were featured in a flashback episode after being reunited. [[Mira Furlan]] as [[Characters of Lost#Danielle Rousseau|Danielle Rousseau]], the shipwrecked Frenchwoman appeared throughout seasons one and two. Some of the "[[Others (Lost)|Others]]," including [[M.C. Gainey]] as [[Others (Lost)#Tom|Tom]], [[Michael Bowen]] as [[Others (Lost)#Danny Pickett|Danny Pickett]], [[William Mapother]] as [[Others (Lost)#Ethan Rom|Ethan Rom]] and [[Tania Raymonde]] as [[Others (Lost)#Alexandra "Alex" Rousseau|Alex Rousseau]]  have been shown in both flashbacks and the ongoing story. Similarly, Jack's father [[Characters of Lost#Christian Shephard|Christian Shephard]], flight attendant [[Characters of Lost#Cindy Chandler|Cindy Chandler]] and marshall [[Characters of Lost#Edward Mars|Edward Mars]] portrayed by [[John Terry (actor)|John Terry]], [[Kimberley Joseph]] and [[Fredric Lehne|Fredric Lane]] respectively, have appeared in multiple flashbacks, as well as on the island.
===Casting===
{{Unreferenced|section|date=December 2006}}
Many of the first season roles were a result of the executive producers' liking of various actors.  The main character Jack was originally to die in the pilot, and was hoped to be played by [[Michael Keaton]], however ABC executives were adamant that Jack live.  Before it was decided that Jack would live, Kate was to emerge as the leader of the survivors; she was originally conceived to be more like the character of Rose. Dominic Monaghan auditioned for the role of Sawyer, who at the time was supposed to be a suit-wearing city con man.  The producers enjoyed Monaghan's performance and changed the character of Charlie to fit him.  Jorge Garcia also auditioned for Sawyer, and the part of Hurley was written for him. When Josh Holloway auditioned for Sawyer, the producers liked the edge he brought to the character (he reportedly kicked a chair when he got angry in the audition) so they changed Sawyer to fit Holloway's acting. Yunjin Kim auditioned for Kate, but the producers wrote the character of Sun for her and the character of Jin, portrayed by Daniel Dae Kim, to be her husband. Naveen Andrews, who plays Sayid, was also not in the original script.  Locke and Michael were written with their actors in mind.  Emilie de Ravin who plays Claire was originally supposed to be a recurring role.  In the second season, Michael Emerson was contracted to play Ben ("Henry Gale") for three episodes.  His role was extended because of his acting skills to eight episodes, and eventually for the whole of season three.

== Mythology==
{{main|Mythology of Lost}}
<!--This is a general summary only; the specific references should go to the main Mythology article.-->

In parallel to its character development, episodes of ''Lost'' include a number of mysterious elements which have been ascribed to [[science fiction]] or [[supernatural]] phenomena. The creators of the series refer to these elements as comprising the [[mythology]] of the series, and they form the basis of fan speculation.<ref>Benson, Jim. [http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA601539.html?display=News The 'Lost' Generation: Networks Go Eerie], ''Broadcasting & Cable'', May 16, 2005.</ref>

Among the show's mythological elements is a "monster" which appears to roam the island; a mysterious group of inhabitants whom the survivors refer to as "The Others"; an organization called the "[[DHARMA]] Initiative" which has placed several [[DHARMA Initiative stations|research stations]] on the island; a sequence of numbers which have made frequent appearances in the lives of the characters, in both the past and present; and personal connections between the characters, of which they are often unaware.

==Thematic motifs==

{{main|Thematic motifs of Lost}}

There are several recurring thematic [[Motif (literature)|motifs]] on ''Lost'', which generally have no direct impact on the story itself, but expand the show's literary and philosophical [[subtext]].  These elements include frequent appearances of the colors [[Black and white (colours)|black and white]], which reflect the [[dualism]] within characters and situations; [[eye]]s, which often appear in close-up at the start of episodes; [[dysfunctional family]] situations, as portrayed in the lives of nearly all the main characters; references to numerous works of [[literature]], including mentions and discussions of particular novels. There are also many allusions to [[philosophy]], demonstrated most clearly in the distinct naming of certain characters after famous historical thinkers, such as [[John Locke]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[David Hume]].<ref name=DH110905>Franklin, Garth. "Paul Dini Gives 'Lost' Spoilers", [http://www.darkhorizons.com/news04/041109d.php Dark Horizon Web site], 9 November 2005.</ref>

== Discredited theories ==
<!-- NOTE:

The ONLY theories to be included in this section are those specifically REFUTED by the show's creators/writers. ALL unsourced theories will be removed, as Original Research. All that is needed is a brief statement of the theory and a link to the verifiable source, indicating who dismissed the theory.

At the heart of the series is a complex and cryptic storyline which spawns numerous unresolved questions. <ref>[http://tv.ign.com/articles/745/745595p1.html IGN's Top 50 Lost Loose Ends]</ref> Encouraged by ''Lost's'' writers and stars, who often interact with fans online, viewers and TV critics alike have taken to widespread theorization in an attempt to unravel the mysteries. Theories mainly concern the nature of the island, the origins of the "monster" and the "Others", the meaning of the numbers, and the reasons for both the crash and the survival of some passengers. 

Several of the more common fan theories have been discussed and rejected by the show's creators, the most common being that the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 are dead or in [[purgatory]].  This was specifically denied by J.J. Abrams and was also proven to be wrong by the second season's [[Episodes of Lost (season 2)#Live Together, Die Alone|finale]].<ref>Fienberg, Daniel.

== Impact ==
=== Ratings ===

'''USA TV Ratings'''

The pilot episode garnered 18.6 million viewers, easily winning its 9/8central timeslot, and giving ABC its strongest [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] since 2000 when ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (US game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' initially aired <U+2014> beaten only the following month by the premiere of ''[[Desperate Housewives]]''. According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', "ABC sure could use a breakout drama success, as it hasn't had a real hit since ''[[The Practice]].'' ''Lost'' represents the network's best start for a drama with eighteen to forty-nine year olds since ''[[Once and Again]]'' in 1999, and in total viewers since ''[[Murder One (TV series)|Murder One]]'' in 1995."<ref>{{cite news|first=Rick|last=Kissell|title=ABC, Eye have quite some night|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117910869?categoryid=14&cs=1|publisher=Variety|date=September 25, 2004}}</ref>

'''World TV Ratings'''

A survey of twenty countries by ''Informa Telecoms and Media'' in 2006 concluded that ''Lost'' was the second most viewed TV show in the world, next to ''[[CSI: Miami]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5231334.stm|date=[[31 July]] [[2006]]|title=CSI show 'most popular in world'|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

===Awards===	 
Capping its successful first season, ''Lost'' won the [[57th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards#Outstanding Drama Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series]] and J. J.

=== Fandom and popular culture===
{{seealso|List of references to Lost in popular culture}}
As with most [[cult television]] shows, ''Lost'' has generated a dedicated and thriving international [[fan (aficionado)|fan]] community. ''Lost'' fans, sometimes dubbed ''Lostaways''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050207/news_lz1b7lost.html|title=Sites in the news, Lostaways|date=[[2005]]-[[02-07]]|publisher=The San Diego Union Tribute|accessdate=2006-08-29}}</ref> or ''Losties'',<ref name="ABCpress20050512">{{cite press release|url=http://abcmedianet.com/pressrel/dispDNR.html?id=051205_03&from=mnsearch|title=ABC Television and Creation Entertainment bring the Official "LOST" Fan Club and Special Events to Cities Around the World|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=[[2005]]-[[05-12]]|accessdate=2006-08-29}}</ref> have gathered at [[Comic-Con International]] and conventions organized by ABC,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,159667,00.html|title='Lost' Fans Hold Convention for Show|first=Don|last=Kaplan|date=[[2005]]-[[06-15]]|publisher=[[FOXNews]]|accessdate=2006-08-29}}</ref><ref name="ABCpress20050512"/> but have also been active in developing a large number of fan websites, including [[Lostpedia]], and forums dedicated to the program and its related incarnations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/01/10/Floridian/Web_ensnares__Lost__s.shtml|title=Web ensnares 'Lost' souls|first=Colette|last=Bancroft|date=[[2006]]-[[01-10]]|publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|accessdate=2006-08-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/03/AR2005120300089.html|title='Lost' Fans Find A Niche on the Internet|first=Frank|last=Ahrens|date=[[2005]]-[[12-04]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=2006-08-29}}</ref><ref name="StPetersburg20060111">{{cite news|url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060111/ENT02/601110412/1034|title=Fans find 'Lost' world on Net|first=Colette|last=Bancroft|date=[[2006]]-[[01-11]]|publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|accessdate=2006-08-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/artsentertainment/2002730079_lostgame10.html|title=Fans play TV series "Lost" like an interactive video game|first=Jennifer|last=Buckendorff|date=[[2006]]-[[01-10]]|publisher=[[The Seattle Times]]|accessdate=2006-08-29}}</ref> Because of the show's elaborate mythology, its fansites have focused on speculation and theorizing about the island's mysteries, as well as on more typical fan activities such as producing [[fan fiction]] and videos, compiling episode transcripts, [[shipping (fandom)|shipping]] characters, and collecting memorabilia.

Anticipating fan interest and trying to keep its audience engrossed, ABC embarked on various cross-media endeavors, often using new media. Fans of ''Lost'' have been able to explore ABC-produced tie-in websites, tie-in novels, an official forum sponsored by the creative team behind ''Lost'' ("The Fuselage"), "[[mobisode]]s", podcasts by the producers, an official magazine, and an [[alternate reality game]] (ARG) "[[The Lost Experience]]."<ref name="StPetersburg20060111"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_30/b3994072.htm|title=Network Finds Marketing Paradise with ''Lost''|first=Tom|last=Lowry|date=[[2006]]-[[07-24]]|publisher=[[BusinessWeek]] Online|accessdate=2006-08-29}}</ref> An official fanclub was launched in the summer of 2005 through Creation Entertainment.<ref name="ABCpress20050512"/>

Due to the show's popularity, references to the series and elements from its story have appeared in [[parody]] and [[popular culture]] usage. These include appearances on television, such as on the series ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', ''[[Will & Grace]]'', ''[[Bo Selecta]]'', ''[[My Wife And Kids]]'' and ''[[The Office (US TV series)|The Office]]''; as well as on the cartoons ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', and ''[[Venture Brothers]]''; and even on a commercial for [[KFC]] [[Hawaii]]. [[Comic books]], such as ''[[Catwoman]]'' and ''[[Thing (comics)|The Thing]]'', daily strips ''[[Monty (comic strip)|Monty]]'' and ''[[Over the Hedge]]'', web comics ''[[Piled Higher and Deeper]]''<ref>http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=766</ref> and ''[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)|Penny Arcade]]'',<ref>http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2006/11/01</ref> and humor magazine ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' have all incorporated ''Lost'' references. Similarly, rock bands [[Moneen]], [[Senses Fail]], and [[Gatsbys American Dream]] have published songs whose themes and titles were derived from the series.

==Other media==
The characters and setting of ''Lost'' have appeared in several official [[tie-in]]s outside of the television broadcast, including in print, on the Internet, and in short videos for mobile phones

As of March of 2006, three [[novelization]]s have been released by [[Hyperion Books]], a publisher owned by ABC's parent company:  ''Endangered Species'' (ISBN 0-7868-9090-8) by Cathy Hapka, released on [[November 1]], [[2005]]; ''Secret Identity'' (ISBN 0-7868-9091-6) by Cathy Hapka on [[January 1]], 2006;  and ''Signs of Life'' (ISBN 0-7868-9092-4) by Frank Thompson, on [[March 1]], [[2006]]. Additionally, Hyperion published a [[metafictional]] book titled ''Bad Twin'' (ISBN 1-4013-0276-9), written by Laurence Shames,<ref>{{cite news |last = Zeitchik|first = Steven|url =http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117945504?categoryId=14&cs=1|title =Inside Move: It's a Shames|publisher =[[Daily Variety]]|date= 2006-06-18|accessdate = 2006-06-19}}</ref> and credited to fictitious author "[[Gary Troup (Lost)|Gary Troup]]," who was claimed to be a passenger on Oceanic Flight 815 by ABC's marketing department. ''Finding Lost: The Unofficial Guide'' (ISBN 1-55022-743-2) by Nikki Stafford and published by [[ECW Press]] is a book detailing the show for fans and those new to the show. ''LOST: The Ultimate Unofficial Guide to ABC's Hit Series LOST News, Analysis, and Interpretation'' (ISBN 1-933804-03-3) by Rebecca K. O'Conner & Jim Stewart and published by [[Equity Press]] was the first guide dedicated to news, interpretation and predictions about the future direction of the show.{{uncited}}

The show's networks and producers have made extensive use of the Internet in expanding the background of the story. For example, during the first season, a fictional diary by an unseen survivor called "Janelle Granger" was presented on the ABC web site for the series.  Likewise, a tie-in website about the fictional [[Oceanic Airlines]] appeared during the first season, which included several [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter eggs]] and clues about the show. Another tie-in website was launched after the airing of "[[Episodes of Lost (season 2)#Orientation|Orientation]]" about the [[Hanso Foundation]]. In the UK, the interactive back-stories of several characters are included in "Lost Untold," a section of [[Channel 4]]'s ''Lost'' website. Similarly, since November 2005, ABC has produced an official [[podcast]], hosted by series writers and executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse. The podcast typically features a discussion about the weekly episode, interviews with cast members and questions from viewers.<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/podcasts/107675.html ABC Official Lost Podcast]</ref> Sky One also hosts a podcast presented by [[Iain Lee]] on their 4radio platform, which analyzes each episode after it airs in the UK.<ref>[http://www.skyone.co.uk/Lost/Season3/ Sky One Official Lost Podcast]</ref>
 
The foray into the online realm culminated in "[[Lost Experience|The Lost Experience]]" an Internet-based [[alternate reality game]]  produced by Channel 4 and ABC, which began in early May 2006.  The game presents a five-phase parallel storyline, primarily involving [[The Hanso Foundation]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.disneyabctv.com/datvg_press/dispDNR.html?id=072506_12| title=Global interactive phenomenon, Lost Experience, to reveal meaning behind mysterious numbers on international hit TV show "Lost" | publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Press Release|date=[[2006-07-25]]| accessdate=2006-07-27}}</ref>  

Short mini-episodes ("[[mobisode]]s") called the ''Lost Video Diaries'' were originally scheduled for viewing by [[Verizon Wireless]] subscribers via its V-Cast system, but were initially delayed by contract disputes.<ref>{{cite news| first=Andrew and Jesse Hiestand| last=Wallenstein|url=http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=technologyNews&storyid=2006-04-25T110339Z_01_N24351020_RTRUKOC_0_US-UNIONS.xml| title=ABC, unions reach deal on cell phone TV shows| publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=[[2006-04-25]]| accessdate=2006-04-25}}</ref><ref>[http://www.disneyabctv.com/datvg_press/dispDNR.html?id=042406_14 ABC Press Release]</ref> Each video diary will run several minutes and cover events not seen in the television episodes.<ref>{{cite news| first=Gina| last=Serpe| url=http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,17795,00.html| title="Lost" Finds Its Calling| publisher=[[E!|E!

In addition to tie-in novels, several other types of products based on the series, such as toys and games, have been licensed for release.
