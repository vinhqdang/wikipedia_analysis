'''''Banksia ericifolia''''', the '''Heath-leaved Banksia''' (also known as the '''Lantern Banksia''' or '''Heath Banksia'''), is a [[species]] of woody [[shrub]] of the [[Proteaceae]] family native to [[Australia]]. It grows in two separate regions of Central and Northern [[New South Wales]] east of the [[Great Dividing Range]]. Well known for its orange or red autumn [[inflorescence]]s, which contrast with its green fine-leaved heath-like foliage, it is a medium to large shrub that can reach 6&nbsp;m (20&nbsp;ft) high and wide, though is usually half that size. In exposed heathlands and coastal areas it is more often 1<U+2013>2&nbsp;m (3<U+2013>7&nbsp;ft).

''Banksia ericifolia'' was one of the original ''[[Banksia]]'' species collected by [[Joseph Banks]] around [[Botany Bay]] in 1770 and was named by [[Carolus Linnaeus the Younger|Carl Linnaeus the Younger]], son of [[Carolus Linnaeus]], in 1782. A distinctive plant, it has split into two subspecies: ''Banksia ericifolia'' subspecies ''ericifolia'' of the Sydney region and ''Banksia ericifolia'' subspecies ''macrantha'' of the New South Wales [[Northern Rivers, New South Wales|Far North Coast]] which was recognized in 1996.

''Banksia ericifolia'' has been widely grown in Australian gardens on the east coast for many years as well as being used to a limited extent in the cut flower industry. Compact dwarf [[cultivar]]s such as ''Banksia'' 'Little Eric' have become more popular in recent years with the trend toward smaller gardens.

==Description==
[[Image:Banksia ericifolia WC multibuds email.jpg|left|thumb|''B. ericifolia'' "White Candles" showing rare multiple spikes]]

''Banksia ericifolia'' grows as a large shrub up to 6&nbsp;metres (20&nbsp;ft) in height, though often smaller, around 1&ndash;2&nbsp;metres (3&ndash;6&nbsp;ft), in exposed places such as coastal or mountain heathlands. The grey-coloured bark is smooth and fairly thin with [[lenticel]]s; however it can thicken significantly with age. The [[Leaf shape|linear]] dark green leaves are small and narrow, 9&ndash;20&nbsp;mm (<U+2153>&ndash;<U+00BE>&nbsp;in) long and up to 1&nbsp;mm wide, generally with two small teeth at the tips. The leaves are crowded and [[phyllotaxis|alternately arranged]] on the branches.<ref name ="Harden02"/> New growth generally occurs in summer and is an attractive lime green colour.<ref name ="Taylor 1988">{{The Banksia Atlas}}</ref> 

Flowering is in autumn, or in winter in cooler areas; the inflorescences are flower [[spike (botany)|spikes]] 7&ndash;22&nbsp;cm (3&ndash;10&nbsp;in) high and 5&nbsp;cm (2&nbsp;in) broad or so. Each individual flower consists of a tubular [[perianth]] made up of four fused [[tepal]]s, and one long wiry [[carpel|style]]. Characteristic of the taxonomic section in which it is placed, the styles are hooked rather than straight. The styles' ends are initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but break free at [[anthesis]], when the flowers open.<ref name ="George_1999"/> The spikes are red or gold in overall colour, with styles golden, orange, orange-red or [[Burgundy (color)|burgundy]]. Some unusual forms have striking red styles on a whitish perianth. Very occasionally, forms with all yellow inflorescences are seen. Though not terminal, the flower spikes are fairly prominently displayed emerging from the foliage; they arise from two- to three-year-old nodes.

Old flower spikes fade to brown and then grey with age; old flower parts soon fall, revealing numerous small dark grey to dull black finely furred [[Follicle (fruit)|follicles]]. Oblong in shape and 15&ndash;20&nbsp;mm (<U+00BD>&ndash;<U+2154>&nbsp;in) in diameter, the follicles are ridged on each valve and remain closed until burnt by fire.<ref name = "Harden02"/> ''Banksia ericifolia'' responds to fire by seeding, the parent plant being killed. As plants take several years to flower in the wild, it is very sensitive to too-frequent burns and has been eliminated in some areas where this occurs. With time and the production of more cones with seed-containing follicles, however, plants can store up to 16,500 seeds at eight years of age.<ref name ="Honig92">{{cite journal |author=Honig MA, Cowling RM, Richardson DM |year=1992|title= The invasive potential of Australian banksias in South African fynbos: A comparison of the reproductive potential of ''Banksia ericifolia'' and ''Leucadendron laureolum'' |journal= Australian journal of ecology|volume= 17|issue=3 |pages=305<U+2013>314 |id= |url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=ENV&recid=2811337&q=Banksia+ericifolia&uid=788363120&setcookie=yes (abstract) |accessdate=2007-06-28|doi= 10.1111/j.1442-9993.1992.tb00812.x}}</ref> Some plants produce multiple flower spikes, possibly of varying sizes, from a single point of origin.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=S |year=1992 |title=Multiple Flower Heads |journal=Banksia Study Report |volume=9 |pages=58 |id=ISSN 0728-2893}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Blake |first=T |year=1988 |title=Multiple Heads |journal=Banksia Study Report |volume=8 |pages=2 |id=ISSN 0728-2893}}</ref>

''B.&nbsp;ericifolia'' was first collected at [[Botany Bay]] on 29 April 1770, by [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]] and [[Daniel Solander|Dr Daniel Solander]], naturalists on the ''[[HM Bark Endeavour|Endeavour]]'' during Lieutenant (later Captain) [[James Cook]]'s first voyage to the [[Pacific Ocean]].<ref name="Wharton 1893">{{cite book | editor = William J. L. Wharton (ed.) | year = 1893 | title = [[Wikisource:Captain Cook's Journal, First Voyage|Captain Cook's Journal during his First Voyage Round the World made in H. M.

Linnaeus distinguished the species by their leaf shapes and named them accordingly. Thus the species with leaves reminiscent of [[heather]] (at the time classified in the genus ''[[Erica]]'') was given the specific name ''ericaefolia'', from the Latin ''erica'', meaning "heather", and ''folium'', meaning "leaf".<ref name="L.f. 1782">{{cite book | author = [[Carolus Linnaeus the Younger]] | year = 1782 | title = [[Supplementum Plantarum]] | location = Brunsvigae | publisher = Orphanotrophei}}</ref> This spelling was later adjusted to "''ericifolia''"; thus the [[Binomial nomenclature|full name]] for the species is ''Banksia ericifolia'' L.f., with the initials ''[[List of botanists by author abbreviation#L|L.f.]]'' identifying Carolus Linnaeus the Younger.<ref name="APNI">{{APNI | name = ''Banksia ericifolia'' L.f. | id = 53469}}</ref>

While many ''Banksia'' species have undergone much taxonomic change since publication, the distinctive ''B.&nbsp;ericifolia'' has remained largely unchanged as a species concept. Consequently, the species has no [[taxonomic synonym]]s; it does, however, have three [[nomenclatural synonym]]s. The first synonym, ''Banksia phylicaefolia'' Salisb, was published by the English botanist [[Richard Anthony Salisbury]] in his 1796 ''Prodromus stirpium in horto ad Chapel Allerton vigentium''. It was intended as a replacement name for ''B.&nbsp;ericaefolia'', but Salisbury gave no reason why such a replacement was necessary.<ref name="Salisbury 1796">{{cite book | first = Richard Anthony | last = Salisbury | authorlink = Richard Anthony Salisbury | title = Prodromus stirpium in horto ad Chapel Allerton vigentium[http://www.google.com.au/books?id=FoYCAAAAYAAJ] | location = London}}</ref> The name was therefore superfluous, and hence illegitimate.<ref name="APNI 54856">{{APNI | name = ''Banksia phylicaefolia'' Salisb. | id = 54856}}</ref> The second synonym arose from [[Otto Kuntze]]'s 1891 challenge of the name ''Banksia'' L.f., on the grounds that ''Banksia'' J.R.Forst & G.Forst had been [[Homonym (botany)|published before it]], for the genus now known as ''[[Pimelea]]''. Kuntze transferred all ''Banksia'' species to the new genus name ''Sirmuellera'', in the process publishing ''Sirmuellera ericifolia'' (L.f.) Kuntze.<ref name="APNI 22941">{{APNI | name = ''Sirmuellera ericifolia'' (L.f.) Kuntze | id = 22941}}</ref> The challenge failed, however; indeed, his [[Revisio Generum Plantarum|entire treatise]] was widely rejected. Finally, in 1905 [[James Britten]] mounted a similar challenge, proposing to transfer all ''Banksia'' species into ''Isostylis''; ''B.&nbsp;ericifolia'' L.f. thus becoming ''Isostylis ericifolia'' L.f. (Britten).<ref name="APNI 48101">{{APNI | name = ''Isostylis ericifolia'' L.f. (Britten) | id = 48101}}</ref> This challenge also failed.

A recent change to the species' taxonomy is the recognition, in 1981, of an [[infraspecific taxon]]. The existence of different forms of ''B.&nbsp;ericifolia'' was first recognised in 1979 by the amateur botanist Alf Salkin, who noted three distinct forms of the species, with one being a possible hybrid with ''[[Banksia spinulosa var. cunninghamii|Banksia spinulosa'' var. ''cunninghamii]]''. Salkin gave his northern form the provisional infraspecific name "microphylla",<ref name = "Salkin 1979">{{cite book | last = Salkin | first = Abraham Isaac | title = Variation In Banksia in Eastern Australia: An Investigation Using Experimental Methods | publisher = Monash University | year = 1979 | location = Clayton, Victoria | page = 239  }}</ref> but when [[Alex George]] published a formal description in his 1981 ''[[The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)]]'', he named it ''B.&nbsp;ericifolia'' var. ''macrantha''.<ref name="George 1981">{{The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)}}</ref> In 1996, it was promoted to [[subspecies|subspecific]] rank as [[Banksia ericifolia subsp. macrantha|''B.&nbsp;ericifolia'' subsp. ''macrantha'']].

===Placement within ''Banksia''===
''Banksia ericifolia'' has traditionally been described as lying within [[Banksia ser. Spicigerae|series ''Spicigerae'' of ''Banksia'']], together with ''[[Banksia spinulosa]]'' and various western Hairpin-like Banksias such as ''[[Banksia seminuda|B. seminuda]]'' and ''[[Banksia brownii|B. brownii]]''. This series is placed in [[Banksia sect. Oncostylis|''Banksia'' sect. ''Oncostylis'']] according to [[Alex George]]'s [[George's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia|taxonomy of Banksia]],<ref name ="George_1999">{{cite book|author=George, Alex|year=1999|chapter=Banksia|editor=Wilson, Annette (ed.)|title=Flora of Australia: Volume 17B: Proteaceae 3: Hakea to Dryandra|pages=175<U+2013>251|publisher=CSIRO Publishing / Australian Biological Resources Study|isbn=0-643-06454-0}}</ref><ref name ="George 1981">{{cite journal | author = George, Alex | year = 1981 | title = [[The genus Banksia L.f.

Molecular research by American botanist [[Austin Mast]] suggests that ''B. spinulosa'' and ''B. ericifolia'' may be more closely related to [[Banksia ser. Salicinae|''Banksia'' ser. ''Salicinae'']], with includes ''[[Banksia integrifolia]]'' and its relatives.<ref name="Mast 2002">{{cite journal | author = [[Austin Mast|Mast, Austin]] and Thomas J.

In 2005, Mast, Eric Jones and Shawn Havery published the results of their cladistic analyses of [[DNA sequence]] data for ''Banksia''. They inferred a [[phylogeny]] markedly different from the accepted taxonomic arrangement, including finding ''Banksia'' to be [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] with respect to ''[[Banksia ser.

They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of ''Dryandra'' was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then ''B.&nbsp;ericifolia'' is placed in ''B.''&nbsp;subg.

===Subspecies===
[[Image:Banksia flower02.jpg|thumb|Orange flowers & long leaves, [[Australian National Botanic Gardens]]]]

Two geographically distinct forms are recognised:

;''Banksia ericifolia'' subsp. ''ericifolia'': The nominate race is found in the Sydney basin, south to the [[Illawarra]] and north to [[Collaroy, New South Wales|Collaroy]], as well as the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. The seedling leaves have 2<U+2013>6&nbsp;teeth on each margin, while the perianths are 19<U+2013>22&nbsp;mm (<U+00BE>&nbsp;in) long and pistils are 30<U+2013>35&nbsp;mm (1<U+00BC>&nbsp;in) long. Salkin noted that this subspecies often grew in association with ''Banksia spinulosa'' var. ''cunninghamii'' and that there were plants with longer leaves some 20<U+2013>25&nbsp;mm (<U+00BE><U+2013>1&nbsp;in) long with entire, curled margins. He gave them the name "longifolia" and suspected these may have been hybrids.<ref name = "Salkin 1979"/>

;''Banksia ericifolia'' subsp. ''macrantha'': The northern race is found on the New South Wales north coast, from Crowdy Head northwards to the [[Queensland]] border. Described as a distinct subspecies in 1996 by Alex George from material he collected at [[Byron Bay, New South Wales|Byron Bay]] in 1975, it is distinguished by finer foliage, more crowded leaves and larger flowers, with the perianths 26<U+2013>28&nbsp;mm (1&nbsp;in) long and pistils 46<U+2013>48&nbsp;mm (1<U+00BE>&nbsp;in) long. The seedling leaves have one, or occasionally two teeth on each margin. Salkin observed that the inflorescences tended to be terminal rather than axial,<ref name = "Salkin 1979"/> and others have noted them to be sometimes taller than the nominate subspecies. Crowdy Bay, in particular, hosts specimens with spikes up to 26&nbsp;cm (10&nbsp;in) in height.<ref name ="Taylor 1988">{{The Banksia Atlas}}</ref>

===Name and symbolism===
In 1992, ''B. ericifolia'' was adopted as the official plant of [[Sydney]],<ref>{{cite web | author = Sydney City Council | title = Sydney's Official Flower | publisher = Sydney City Council | date = | url = http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/AboutSydney/HistoryAndArchives/CivicHistory/SymbolsOfTheCity/SydneysOfficialFlower.asp
 | accessdate = 2007-06-20}}</ref> and is sometimes seen in amenity plantings and parks around the city. It was known as '''wadanggari''' (pron. "wa-tang-gre") to the local [[Eora]] and [[Darug people|Darug]] inhabitants of the Sydney basin.<ref>{{cite book|author=Troy, Jakelin|year=1993|title=The Sydney language|publisher=Jakelin Troy| location=Canberra|isbn=0-646-11015-2|page=59}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
[[Image:B ericifolia dist map gnangarra.png|thumb|250px|Distribution map of ''Banksia ericifolia'']]

In nature, the variety ''ericifolia'' is found on acidic [[sandstone]]-based soils; either in elevated heathland within {{convert|2|km|mi}} of the coast around the [[Sydney]] basin, from Collaroy south to [[Jervis Bay]], or elevated sandstone soils in mountainous areas such as the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]] and the [[Budawangs]].<ref name ="Taylor 1988"/> These heathlands are often moist, with access to some form of underground water, and can even be quite swampy.<ref name ="George_1999"/> It can form dense thickets with the Dagger Hakea (''[[Hakea teretifolia]]'') and Scrub She-oak (''[[Allocasuarina distyla]]'').<ref>{{cite book |author = Fairley A, Moore P |title=Native Plants of the Sydney District: An Identification Guide |year=2000 |edition= 2nd|publisher=Kangaroo Press |location=Kenthurst, NSW |isbn=0-7318-1031-7 |page=173}}</ref> Other plants it associates with include the Coast Tea-tree (''[[Leptospermum laevigatum]]'') and smaller plants such as ''[[Woollsia pungens]]''. The inflorescences are a feature of autumn bushwalking in sandstone areas, such as the Kings Tableland walk in the Blue Mountains, Jennifer Street Boardwalk in [[Little Bay]], and [[Royal National Park]].

The northern subspecies ''macrantha'' is found in two distinct regions on the far north coast of [[New South Wales]]; the first from [[Crowdy Bay National Park|Crowdy Bay]] on the [[Mid North Coast, New South Wales|Mid North Coast]] northwards to [[Hat Head National Park]] north of [[Port Macquarie]], and then from [[Yuraygir National Park]] north to [[Kingscliff, New South Wales|Kingscliff]] just south of the [[Queensland]] border. This variety is more strictly coastal with most populations being found within two kilometres of the coast,<ref name ="Taylor 1988"/> or in swampy areas.<ref name ="George_1999"/> It may be associated with ''[[Banksia oblongifolia]]''.<ref name ="George 1981"/>

==Ecology==
{{main|Ecology of Banksia}}

Like other banksias, ''B. ericifolia'' plays host to a wide variety of pollinators and is a vital source of nectar in autumn, when other flowers are scarce. It has been the subject of a number of studies on pollination. A 1998 study in [[Bundjalung National Park]] in Northern New South Wales found that ''B. ericifolia'' inflorescences are foraged by a variety of small [[mammals]], including [[marsupial]]s such as ''[[Antechinus flavipes]]'' (Yellow-footed Antechinus), and [[rodent]]s such as ''[[Rattus tunneyi]]'' (Pale Field Rat) and ''[[Melomys burtoni]]'' (Grassland Mosaic-tailed Rat). These animals carry pollen loads comparable to those of nectarivorous birds, making them effective pollinators.<ref name="Hackett 2001">{{cite journal | first = Damian J. | last = Hackett | coauthors = Ross L.

A great many bird species have been observed visiting this Banksia species. A 1985 study in the Sydney area of ''B. ericifolia'' var. ''ericifolia'' found numerous birds visiting the inflorescences, including the [[honeyeater]]s ''[[Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris]]'' (Eastern Spinebill), ''[[Phylidonyris nigra]]'' (White-cheeked Honeyeater), ''[[Phylidonyris novaehollandiae]]'' (New Holland Honeyeater), ''[[Melithreptus lunatus]]'' (White-naped Honeyeater), ''[[Lichenostomus chrysops]]'' (Yellow-faced Honeyeater), ''[[Anthochaera carunculata]]'' (Red Wattlebird) and ''[[Anthochaera chrysoptera]]'' (Little Wattlebird), as well as ''[[Zosterops lateralis]]'' (Silvereye).<ref name = "Paton85"/> ''[[Stagonopleura bella]]'' (Beautiful Firetail) also associates with this species.<ref name=Rob93>{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=Peter |title=Birdwatcher's Guide to the Sydney Region |year=1993 |publisher=Kangaroo Press |location=Kenthurst, New South Wales |isbn=0-86417-565-5|page=141}}</ref> Some mammals were recorded in this study but were found to bear no pollen.

''macrantha''.<ref name ="Taylor 1988"/>

Like most other [[proteaceae]], ''B.&nbsp;ericifolia'' has [[proteoid root]]s, ''i.e.'', roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter.

==Cultivation==
''Banksia ericifolia'' was one of the first ''Banksia'' species to be cultivated, having been introduced into cultivation in England in 1788.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Cavanagh | first = T | year = 1982 | title = A note on the cultivation of banksias in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries | journal = Banksia Study Report | volume = 6 |pages = 29<U+2013>32 | id = ISSN 0728-2893}}</ref> By 1804, it had flowered in several collections. That year a painting of the plant by [[Sydenham Edwards]] was featured in ''[[Curtis's Botanical Magazine]]'', accompanied by text describing the species as "a handsome shrub [that] thrives freely".<ref name="Sims 1804">{{cite journal | title = [[Wikisource:Curtis's Botanical Magazine/Volume XIX/738 Banksia Ericaefolia|738. Banksia Eric<U+00E6>folia. Heath-Leaved Banksia.]] | journal = Curtis's Botanical Magazine | volume = 19}}</ref>

''Banksia ericifolia'' inflorescences attract a variety of birds to the garden.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dengate |first=J |title=Attracting Birds to Your Garden |year= 2000 |publisher=New Holland Press |location=Sydney |isbn=1-86436-411-4|page=20}}</ref> Tough enough to be used as a street plant in parts of Sydney, ''B. ericifolia'' is a fairly easy plant to grow in the conditions it likes, namely a sandy, well drained soil and a sunny aspect. It requires extra water over dryer periods until established, which may take up to two years, as it comes from an area with rainfall in predominantly warmer months. It is resistant to ''[[Phytophthora cinnamomi]]'' dieback, like most eastern banksias<ref>{{cite journal| last=McCredie| first=T.A.| coauthors=K.W. Dixon and K. Sivasithamparam|year=1985| title=Variability in the resistance of ''Banksia'' L.f. species to ''[[Phytophthora cinnamomi]]'' Rands| journal=Australian Journal of Botany| volume=3| issue=6|pages=629<U+2013>637| doi=10.1071/BT9850629}}</ref> As it grows naturally on acid soils, ''Banksia ericifolia'' is particularly sensitive to iron deficiency. Known as [[chlorosis]], this problem manifests as yellowing of new leaves with preservation of green veins; it can occur on plants grown in soils of high pH. This can happen especially where soil contains quantities of cement, either as landfill or building foundations, and can be treated with [[iron chelate]] or [[Iron(II) sulfate|sulfate]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Eliot RW, Jones DL, Blake T |title=Encyclopaedia of Australian Plants Suitable for Cultivation: Vol. 2|year=1985 |publisher=Lothian Press |location=Port Melbourne |isbn=0-85091-143-5|page=292}}</ref>

Flowering may take some years from seed; a minimum of four years is average. Buying an advanced plant may hasten this process, as will getting a [[Cutting (plant)|cutting]]-grown plant. ''Banksia ericifolia'' can be propagated easily by seed, and is one of the (relatively) easier banksias to propagate by cutting.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Maclean |first=R |year=1995 |title=Propagation of Banksias |journal=Banksia Study Report |volume=10 |pages=6<U+2013>16 |id=ISSN 0728-2893}}</ref> Named cultivars are by necessity propagated by cuttings as this ensures that the plant produced bears the same attributes as the original plant.

Regular [[pruning]] is important to give the plant an attractive habit and prevent it from becoming leggy. Hard-pruning below green growth is not advisable with this banksia; since it lacks a lignotuber, it does not have dormant buds below the bark that respond to pruning or fire and therefore is unable to sprout from old wood as readily as commonly cultivated lignotuberous species, such as ''B. spinulosa'' and ''[[Banksia robur|B. robur]]''.<ref name = "George96">{{The_Banksia_Book}}</ref>

For many years the horticulture industry focussed on registered selections of ''Banksia spinulosa'', but since the late 1990s more and more cultivars of ''Banksia ericifolia'' have come on the market, including colour variants and dwarf forms. The latter are particularly attractive as the original plant may reach 6&nbsp;metres in height, and the new cultivars help enthusiasts choose a plant that is right for their conditions and tastes.<ref name ="Lib04">{{cite journal|author=Liber C|year=2004|title=Update on Eastern Cultivars|journal=Banksia Study Group Newsletter|volume=5|issue=1|pages=3<U+2013>5|publisher=[ASGAP]|url=http://asgap.org.au/banksSG/banksiasg-5-1.pdf |accessdate=2007-06-23 |id=ISSN 1444-285X|format=PDF}}</ref> ''Banksia ericifolia'' is also grown for the cut flower industry in Australia, though not to the degree that the western Australian species such as ''[[Banksia coccinea|B. coccinea]]'' and ''[[Banksia menziesii|B. menziesii]]'' are.<ref>{{cite web | author = Sedgley M | title = The New Rural Industries: A handbook for Farmers and Investors  | publisher = Rural Industries Research & Development Corporation | year = 1998 | url = http://www.rirdc.gov.au/pub/handbook/banksias.html | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref>

There are a number of commercial varieties available from Australian retail nurseries; however none have yet been registered under [[plant breeders' rights]] legislation, and only one ([[Banksia 'Limelight'|'Limelight']]) is registered with the [[Australian Cultivar Registration Authority]]. The lack of official names has led to some varieties bearing several different names.<!--Directed quotation marks are used around cultivar names in this list to avoid using <nowiki> tags.-->
*'''''Banksia ericifolia'' 'Bronzed Aussie'''' is a white-budded terminal-flowering form to 2&nbsp;m with bronzed foliage; the inflorescences have honey-coloured pistils. It has been propagated by Victorian nurseryman Rod Parsons of Carawah Nursery in [[Hoddles Creek, Victoria|Hoddles Creek]]. A new release in 2003, its provenance is unknown; seed had been given to Rod's father by an [[Association of Societies for Growing Australian Plants|SGAP]] member many years ago.<ref name ="Lib04"/>
*'''''Banksia ericifolia'' 'Golden Girl'''' is a golden yellow-flowered form which grows to 1.5<U+2013>1.8&nbsp;m (5<U+2013>6&nbsp;ft) in height with blue-grey foliage. It has hidden wide fat flowers to 8&nbsp;cm high and has been propagated by Rod Parsons of Carawah Nursery. Released in 2003, its provenance is unknown (seed donated to Rod's father by an SGAP member many years ago.)<ref name ="Lib04"/>
*'''''Banksia ericifolia'' 'Kanangra Gold'''', propagated by Kuranga Nursery in Melbourne, is a gold flowered form to 4&nbsp;m (13&nbsp;ft) from the [[Kanangra-Boyd National Park|Kanangra-Boyd]] region of the Blue Mountains. It is bushy and flowers are much paler than the regular orange or red forms.<ref name ="Lib04"/>
*'''''Banksia ericifolia'' [[Banksia 'Limelight'|'Limelight']]''', registered with Australian Cultivar Registration Authority (ACRA) in 1987, is a large plant to 5&nbsp;m (16&nbsp;ft) with bright lime green foliage and orange blossoms. It is seldom seen due to the current focus on smaller forms for smaller gardens.<ref name = "George96"/><ref name ="Lib04"/>
[[Image:Banksia ericifolia WC email.jpg|thumb|''B. ericifolia'' 'White Candles'<br> Cultivar in Sydney, NSW]]
*'''''Banksia ericifolia'' 'Little Eric'''' is a dwarf form reaching 1 or 2&nbsp;m (3<U+2013>6&nbsp;ft); the inflorescences have maroon styles and whitish perianth. It is propagated by Richard Anderson of Merricks Nursery on the [[Mornington Peninsula]] southeast of Melbourne, the original having arisen as a chance garden seedling.<ref name ="Lib04"/>
*'''''Banksia ericifolia'' 'Purple Pygmy'''', also called '''''B.'' 'Port Wine'''', is a dwarf form propagated by Kuranga Nursery that grows to 1&nbsp;m (3&nbsp;ft) with purplish foliage with claret flowers. It only flowers rarely and is difficult to propagate. Also, due to low demand it is only propagated in low numbers.<ref>{{cite book |author=Eliot RW, Jones DL, Blake T |title=Encyclopaedia of Australian Plants Suitable for Cultivation: Supplement No. 1|year=1995|pages=B<U+2013>51 |publisher=Lothian Press |location=Port Melbourne |isbn=0-85091-659-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Blake |first=T |year=1988 |title=Banksia Cultivars |journal=Banksia Study Report |volume=7 |pages=17<U+2013>18 |id=ISSN 0728-2893}}</ref>
*'''''Banksia ericifolia'' 'Red Rover'''' is a dwarf cultivar reaching 1.8&nbsp;m (6&nbsp;ft) with a more open habit than other forms of similar size. This form has lime green foliage and scarlet-red flowers and was propagated by Rod Parsons of Carawah Nursery from a garden selection and released in 2004.<ref name ="Lib04"/>
*'''''Banksia ericifolia'' 'St Pauls'''' is a dwarf form that grows to 2&nbsp;m (6&nbsp;ft) with conspicuous red inflorescences which has been available from time to time from Cranebrook Nursery in Sydney's western suburbs. It was originally propagated from a plant cultivated at St Pauls' secondary school (a local high school).<ref name ="Lib04"/>
*'''''Banksia ericifolia'' 'White candles/Christmas Candles'''', also known as '''''B. ericifolia'' 'Ruby Clusters'''', originated from a plant growing in the [[Sutherland Shire]] in Sydney's south. It has an unusual red style/white body colour combination somewhat reminiscent of ''[[Banksia coccinea|B. coccinea]]''. The buds are white and contrast with the red styles that emerge through them. It is an open shrub to 3<U+2013>4&nbsp;m (9<U+2013>13&nbsp;ft).<ref name ="Lib04"/>
*'''''Banksia ericifolia macrantha'' 'Creamed Honey'''', so called because its flowers are the colour of creamed honey, is a pale flowered variant originally found at Crowdy Head on the New South Wales north coast. Propagated by Kuranga nursery, it grows to 4 or 5&nbsp;m (12<U+2013>16&nbsp;ft) with a more open habit. It is notable in that it is the only cultivar of the northern subspecies of ''Banksia ericifolia'' currently available.
