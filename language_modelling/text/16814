:''This is a sub-article of [[Islamic science]] and [[Astronomy]].''

In the [[history of astronomy]], '''Islamic astronomy''' or '''Arabic astronomy''' refers to the astronomical developments made in the [[Islamic world]], especially during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (8th-15th centuries), mostly written in the [[Arabic language]] and which mostly took place in the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], [[Islamic Spain]] and [[Central Asia]]. It closely parallels the genesis of other [[Islamic science]]s in its assimilation of foreign material and the amalgamation of the disparate elements of that material to create a science that was essentially [[Islam]]ic. These included [[Indian astronomy|Indian]], [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] and [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] works in particular, which were translated and built upon.<ref name = Gingerich/>

A significant number of [[star]]s in the [[sky]], such as [[Aldebaran]] and [[Altair]], and astronomical terms such as [[alhidade]], [[azimuth]], and [[almucantar]], are still today recognized with [[List of Arabic star names|their Arabic names]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icoproject.org/star.html|title=Arabic Star Names|date=2007-05-01}} Islamic Crescents' Observation Project.</ref>

A large corpus of literature from Islamic astronomy remains today, numbering approximately 10,000 manuscripts scattered throughout the world, many of which have not been read or cataloged. Even so, a reasonably accurate picture of Islamic activity in the field of astronomy can be reconstructed.<ref>{{cite|author=Mohammad Ilyas|title=Islamic Astronomy|date=1997|publisher=Pelanduk Publications}} ISBN 9679785491.</ref>

==History==
[[Pre-Islamic Arabia]]n knowledge of [[star]]s was [[Empiricism|empirical]]; their knowledge was what they observed regarding the rising and setting of stars. The rise of [[Islam]] is claimed to have provoked increased [[Arab]] thought in this field.<ref name=Dallal162>Dallal (1999), p. 162</ref> The foundations of Islamic astronomy closely parallels the genesis of other Islamic sciences in its assimilation of foreign material and the amalgamation of the disparate elements of that material to create a science that was essentially Islamic. These include [[Indian astronomy|Indian]], [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] and [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] works which were [[translation|translated]] and built upon.

The science historian [[Donald Routledge Hill]] has divided the history of Islamic astronomy into the four following distinct time periods in its history:<ref name="Dallal162"/>
*Assimilation and syncretisation of earlier Hellenistic, Indian and Sassanid astronomy ([[700]]-[[825]])
*Vigorous investigation, and acceptance and modification to the [[Ptolemaic system]] ([[825]]-[[1025]])
*Flourishing of a distinctive Islamic system of astronomy ([[1025]]-[[1450]])
*Stagnation, where few significant contributions were made ([[1450]]-[[1900]])

;''Impetus''

Historians point out several factors that fostered the growth of Islamic astronomy. The first was the proximity of the [[Muslim world]] to the world of ancient learning. Much of the ancient [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Sanskrit]] and [[Middle Persian]] texts were translated into [[Arabic]] during the ninth century. This process was enhanced by the tolerance towards scholars of other religions.<ref name = Gingerich>Gingerich, Owen (April 1986). ''[http://faculty.kfupm.edu.sa/phys/alshukri/PHYS215/Islamic%20astronomy.htm Islamic astronomy]''. [[Scientific American]], '''254''' (10): 74 </ref>

Another impetus came from Islamic religious observances, which presented a host of problems in mathematical astronomy. In solving these religious problems the Islamic scholars went far beyond the Greek mathematical methods.<ref name = Gingerich/>

===610-700===
There are several [[cosmology|cosmological]] verses in the [[Qur'an]] (610-632) which some modern writers have interpreted as foreshadowing the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]] and possibly even the [[Big Bang]] theory:<ref>A. Abd-Allah, [http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/scislam.html The Qur'an, Knowledge, and Science], [[University of Southern California]].</ref>

<blockquote>[21:30] Don't those who reject faith see that the heavens and the earth were a single entity then We ripped them apart?
<br>[51:47] And the heavens We did create with Our Hands, and We do cause it to expand.</blockquote>

Several [[hadith]]s attributed to [[Muhammad]] also show that he was generally opposed to [[astrology]] as well as [[superstition]] in general. An example of this is when an [[eclipse]] occurred during his son [[Ibrahim]]'s death, and rumours began spreading about this being God's personal condolence. Muhammad is said to have replied:<ref>James A. Michene, "Islam: The Misunderstood Religion", ''Reader's Digest'', May 1955, pp. 68-70.</ref>

{{quote|"An eclipse is a phenomenon of nature. It is foolish to attribute such things to the death or birth of a human being."}}

===700-825===
The period of assimilation and syncretisation of earlier Hellenistic, Indian and Sassanid astronomy occurred during the eighth and early ninth centuries. 

;''Early Islamic cosmology''

In the early eighth century, prior to the translation movement, [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] refuted the [[geocentric model]] of the [[universe]] common at the time, in which the [[Earth]] is stationary, and the [[Sun]], [[Moon]] and the [[planet]]s are orbiting around it. He was the first to refute [[Ptolemy]]'s theory of the sun having two movements, one going around the Earth in one year and the other going round the earth in 24 hours causing [[day]] and [[night]]. Al-Sadiq argued that if the Sun is moving round the Earth for one year, it cannot suddenly change its course and go round the Earth for one day. He suggested that this could be explained with a [[heliocentrism|heliocentric theory]] in which the [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotates]] on its axis and around the Sun. Al-Sadiq also wrote a theory on how the [[universe]] is [[Metric expansion of space|expanding]] and contracting. He also stated that every [[Physical body|object]] in the universe is always in [[Motion (physics)|motion]], including objects which appear to be [[Animate (disambiguation)|inanimate]].<ref name=Strasburg>Research Committee of [[University of Strasbourg|Strasburg University]], ''Imam Jafar Ibn Muhammad As-Sadiq A.S. The Great Muslim Scientist and Philosopher'', translated by Kaukab Ali Mirza, 2000. Willowdale Ont. ISBN 0969949014.</ref>

Al-Sadiq's student, [[Geber]] (Jabir ibn Hayyan), asked him the following question on the [[star]]s:

{{quote|"How does the movement of the stars keep them from falling?"<ref name="Strasburg"/>}}

Al-Sadiq replied:

{{quote|"Put a stone in a [[sling]] and swing it round your head. The stone will stay in the sling so long as you are [[Rotation|rotating]] it. But as soon as you stop the rotation, the stone will fall down on the ground. In the same way the [[perpetual motion]] of stars keeps them from falling down."<ref name="Strasburg"/>}}

;''Ancient influences and translation movement''

During this period, a number of [[Sanskrit]] and [[Middle Persian]] texts were first translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. The most notable of the texts was ''Zij al-Sindhind'',<ref>This book is not related to al-Khwarizmi's ''Zij al-Sindh''.  On ''zijes'' see E. S. Kennedy, "A Survey of Islamic Astronomical Tables".</ref> based on the ''[[Surya Siddhanta]]'' and the works of [[Brahmagupta]], and translated by [[Muhammad al-Fazari]] and [[Yaq<U+016B>b ibn T<U+0101>riq]] in 777. Sources indicate that the text was translated after an [[Indian astronomy|Indian astronomer]] visited the court of [[Caliph]] [[Al-Mansur]] in 770. The most notable Middle Persian text translated was the ''Zij al-Shah'', a collection of astronomical tables compiled in Sassanid Persia over two centuries.

Fragments of text during this period indicate that Arabs adopted the [[Trigonometric function|sine function]] (inherited from [[Indian mathematics|Indian trigonometry]]) instead of the [[chord]]s of [[Arc (geometry)|arc]] used in Hellenistic mathematics.<ref name=Dallal162/> Another Indian influence was an approximate formula used for [[time]]keeping by Muslim astronomers.<ref>David A. King (2002). "A Vetustissimus Arabic Text on the Quadrans Vetus", ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'' '''33''', p. 237-255 [240].</ref>

[[Image:Almagest.jpg|thumb|right|A page from Ptolemy's ''Almagest''.]]
Islamic interest in [[astronomy]] ran parallel to the interest in mathematics. Especially noteworthy in this regard was the ''[[Almagest]]'' (c. 150) of the [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] astronomer [[Ptolemy]] (c. 100-178). The ''Almagest'' was a landmark work in its field, assembling, as [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' had previously done with geometrical works, all extant knowledge in the field of astronomy that was known to the author. This work was originally known as ''The Mathematical Composition'', but after it had come to be used as a text in astronomy, it was called ''The Great Astronomer''. The Islamic world called it ''The Greatest'' prefixing the Greek work ''megiste'' (greatest) with the article ''al-'' and it has since been known to the world as ''Al-megiste'' or, after popular use in [[Western world|Western]] translation, ''Almagest''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Greek Astronomy|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/expo/vatican.exhibit/exhibit/d-mathematics/Greek_astro.html |accessdate=2008-01-15}}</ref> though much of the ''Almagest'' was incorrect, even in premise, it remained a standard astronomical text in both the Islamic world and [[Europe]] until the work of the [[Maragheh observatory|Maragha school]] and [[Nicolaus Copernicus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/Almagest.html|title=Almagest|publisher=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science|accessdate=2008-01-15}}</ref> Ptolemy also produced other works, such as ''Optics'', ''[[Harmonica]]'', and some suggest he also wrote ''Tetrabiblon''.

The ''Almagest'' was a particularly unifying work for its exhaustive lists of [[sidereal]] phenomena. He drew up a list of chronological tables of [[Assyria]]n, [[Persian Empire|Persian]], [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] kings for use in reckoning the lapse of time between known astronomical events and fixed dates. In addition to its relevance to calculating accurate calendars, it linked far and foreign cultures together by a common interest in the stars and astrology. The work of Ptolemy was replicated and refined over the years under [[Arab]], [[Persian people|Persian]] and other [[Muslim]] astronomers and astrologers.

===825-1025===
The period throughout the ninth, tenth and early eleventh centuries was one of vigorous investigation, in which the superiority of the [[Ptolemaic system]] of astronomy was accepted and significant contributions made to it. Astronomical research was greatly supported by the [[Abbasid]] [[caliph]] [[al-Mamun]]. [[Baghdad]] and [[Damascus]] became the centers of such activity. The caliphs not only supported this work [[financial]]ly, but endowed the work with formal prestige.<ref>{{MacTutor|id=Sinan|title=Abu Said Sinan ibn Thabit ibn Qurra|date=November 1999|accessdate=2008-01-15}}</ref>

[[Image:Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Musa al-Khwarizmi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Muhammad ibn M<U+016B>s<U+0101> al-Khw<U+0101>rizm<U+012B>|Al-Khwarizmi]], the father of [[algebra]] and [[algorithm]]s, wrote the ''[[Zij]] al-Sindh''.]]

;''Observational astronomy''

The first major original Muslim work of astronomy was ''Zij al-Sindh'' by [[Muhammad ibn M<U+016B>s<U+0101> al-Khw<U+0101>rizm<U+012B>|al-Khwarizimi]] in 830. The work contains tables for the movements of the sun, the moon and the five planets known at the time. The work is significant as it introduced Indian and Ptolemaic concepts into Islamic sciences. This work also marked the turning point in Islamic astronomy. Hitherto, Muslim astronomers had adopted a primarily research approach to the field, translating works of others and learning already discovered knowledge. Al-Khwarizmi's work marked the beginning of non-traditional methods of study and calculations.<ref>Dallal (1999), pg. 163</ref>  

In 850, [[Alfraganus|al-Farghani]] wrote ''Kitab fi Jawani'' ("''A compendium of the science of stars''"). The book primarily gave a summary of Ptolemic cosmography. However, it also corrected Ptolemy's ''Almagest'' based on findings of earlier Arab astronomers. Al-Farghani gave revised values for the obliquity of the ecliptic, the precessional movement of the [[apogee]]s of the sun and the moon, and the circumference of the earth. The books were widely circulated through the Muslim world, and even translated into [[Latin]].<ref>Dallal (1999), pg. 164</ref>

[[Muhammad ibn J<U+0101>bir al-Harr<U+0101>n<U+012B> al-Batt<U+0101>n<U+012B>]] (Albatenius) (853-929) discovered that the direction of the Sun's [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] was changing, which in modern astronomy is equivalent to the Earth moving in an [[elliptical orbit]] around the Sun.<ref>C. Singer (1959), ''A Short History of Scientific Ideas'', p. 151, [[Oxford University Press]] ([[cf.]] Salah Zaimeche (2002), [http://www.muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=235 The Muslim Pioneers of Astronomy], FSTC)</ref> His times for the [[new moon]], lengths for the [[solar year]] and [[sidereal year]], prediction of [[eclipse]]s, and work on the phenomenon of [[parallax]], carried astronomers "to the verge of [[relativity]] and the [[space age]]."<ref>G.

[[Image:Book Al Sufi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Azophi]]'s ''[[Book of Fixed Stars]]''. The constellation pictured here is [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]].]]

In the 10th century, [[al-Sufi]] (Azophi) carried out observations on the [[star]]s and described their [[position]]s, [[magnitude]]s, brightness, and [[colour]], and drawings for each constellation in his ''[[Book of Fixed Stars]]''. [[Ibn Yunus]] observed more than 10,000 entries for the sun's position for many years using a large [[astrolabe]] with a diameter of nearly 1.4 metres. His observations on [[eclipse]]s were still used centuries later in [[Simon Newcomb]]'s investigations on the motion of the moon, while his other observations inspired [[Laplace]]'s ''Obliquity of the Ecliptic'' and ''Inequalities of Jupiter and Saturn's''.<ref name=Zaimeche>Salah Zaimeche (2002), [http://www.muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=235 The Muslim Pioneers of Astronomy], FSTC</ref>

[[Abu-Mahmud al-Khujandi]] relatively accurately computed the [[axial tilt]] to be 23<U+00B0>32'19" (23.53<U+00B0>),<ref>Richard P. Aulie (1994), "Al-Ghazali Contra Aristotle: An Unforeseen Overture to Science In Eleventh-Century Baghdad", ''PSCF'' '''45''': 26-46 ([[cf.]] [http://www.1001inventions.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=main.viewSection&intSectionID=441 References], 1001 Inventions)</ref> which was a significant improvement over the Greek and Indian estimates of 23<U+00B0>51'20" (23.86<U+00B0>) and 24<U+00B0>,<ref>[[George Saliba]], [http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=IkL5Klh9WlY Lecture at SOAS, London - Part 3/7], [[YouTube]]</ref> and still very close to the modern measurement of 23<U+00B0>26' (23.44<U+00B0>).

;''Early heliocentric models''

In the late ninth century, [[Ja'far ibn Muhammad Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi]] developed a planetary model which some have interpreted as a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric model]]. This is due to his [[Orbit (disambiguation)|orbital revolutions]] of the planets being given as heliocentric revolutions rather than [[Geocentric model|geocentric]] revolutions, and the only known planetary theory in which this occurs is in the heliocentric theory. His work on planetary theory has not survived, but his astronomical data was later recorded by al-Hashimi, [[Ab<U+016B> Rayh<U+0101>n al-B<U+012B>r<U+016B>n<U+012B>]] and [[al-Sijzi]].<ref>[[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden]] (1987). "The Heliocentric System in Greek, Persian and Hindu Astronomy", ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'' '''500''' (1), 525<U+2013>545 [534-537].</ref>

In the tenth century, the [[Brethren of Purity]] published the ''[[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity]]'', in which a heliocentric view of the universe is expressed in a section on [[cosmology]]:<ref>Seyyed [[Hossein Nasr]] (1993), ''An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines'', p. 77. [[State University of New York Press]], ISBN 0791415163.</ref>

{{quote|"God has placed the Sun at the center of the Universe just as the capital of a country is placed in its middle and the ruler's palace at the center of the city."}}

In the early eleventh century, [[al-Biruni]] had met several Indian scholars who believed in a heliocentric system. In his ''Indica'', he discusses the theories on the [[Earth's rotation]] supported by [[Brahmagupta]] and other [[Indian astronomy|Indian astronomers]], while in his ''Canon Masudicus'', al-Biruni writes that [[Aryabhata]]'s followers assigned the first movement from east to west to the Earth and a second movement from west to east to the fixed stars. Al-Biruni also wrote that [[al-Sijzi]] also believed the Earth was moving and invented an [[astrolabe]] called the "Zuraqi" based on this idea:<ref name=Nasr>Seyyed [[Hossein Nasr]] (1993), ''An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines'', p. 135-136. [[State University of New York Press]], ISBN 0791415163.</ref>

{{quote|"I have seen the astrolabe called Zuraqi invented by Abu Sa'id Sijzi. I liked it very much and praised him a great deal, as it is based on the idea entertained by some to the effect that the motion we see is due to the Earth's   movement and not to that of the sky. By my life, it is a problem difficult of solution and refutation. [...] For it is the same whether you take it that the Earth is in motion or the sky. For, in both cases, it does not affect the Astronomical Science. It is just for the physicist to see if it is possible to refute it."}}

In his ''Indica'', al-Biruni briefly refers to his work on the refutation of heliocentrism, the ''Key of Astronomy'', which is now lost:<ref name=Nasr/>

{{quote|"The most prominent of both modern and ancient astronomers have deeply studied the question of the moving earth, and tried to refute it. We, too, have composed a book on the subject called ''Miftah 'ilm al-hai'ah'' (''Key of Astronomy''), in which we think we have surpassed our predecessors, if not in the words, at all events in the matter."}}

;''Beginning of astrophysics and celestial mechanics''

The eldest [[Ban<U+016B> M<U+016B>s<U+0101>]] brother, [[Ja'far Muhammad ibn M<U+016B>s<U+0101> ibn Sh<U+0101>kir]] (9th century), made significant contributions to [[astrophysics]] and [[celestial mechanics]]. He was the first to hypothesize that the heavenly bodies and [[celestial spheres]] were subject to the same [[Physical law|laws of physics]] as [[Earth]], unlike the ancients who believed that the celestial spheres followed their own set of physical laws different from that of Earth.<ref>[[George Saliba]] (1994). "Early Arabic Critique of Ptolemaic Cosmology: A Ninth-Century Text on the Motion of the Celestial Spheres", ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'' '''25''', p. 115-141 [116].</ref>

In his ''Astral Motion'' and ''The Force of Attraction'', Muhammad ibn Musa proposed that there was a [[force]] of [[Gravitation|attraction]] between [[Astronomical object|heavenly bodies]],<ref>K. A. Waheed (1978). ''Islam and The Origins of Modern Science'', p. 27. Islamic Publication Ltd., Lahore.</ref> foreshadowing [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]].<ref>[[Robert Briffault]] (1938). ''The Making of Humanity'', p. 191.</ref>

[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen), in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021), was the first to discover that the [[celestial spheres]] do not consist of [[solid]] matter, and he also discovered that the heavens are less dense than the air. These views were later repeated by [[Witelo]] and had a significant influence on the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican]] and [[Tychonic system]]s of astronomy.<ref>Edward Rosen (1985), "The Dissolution of the Solid Celestial Spheres", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' '''46''' (1), p. 13-31 [19-20, 21].</ref>

;''Beginning of experimental astronomy''

In the eleventh century, [[Ab<U+016B> Rayh<U+0101>n al-B<U+012B>r<U+016B>n<U+012B>]] introduced the [[Scientific method|experimental method]] into astronomy and was the first to conduct elaborate [[experiment]]s related to astronomical phenomena. He discovered the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]] to be a collection of numerous [[Nebula|nebulous]] [[star]]s. In [[Afghanistan]], he observed and described the [[solar eclipse]] on [[April 8]], [[1019]], and the [[lunar eclipse]] on [[September 17]], [[1019]], in detail, and gave the exact [[latitude]]s of the stars during the lunar eclipse.<ref name=Zahoor>Dr. A. Zahoor (1997), [http://www.unhas.ac.id/~rhiza/saintis/biruni.html Abu Raihan Muhammad al-Biruni], [[Hasanuddin University]].</ref>

This led to the use of exacting [[empirical]] observations and experimental techniques by Muslim astronomers from the eleventh century onwards.<ref>Toby Huff, ''The Rise of Early Modern Science'', p. 326. [[Cambridge University Press]], ISBN 0521529948.</ref>

===1025-1450===
During this period, a distinctive Islamic system of astronomy flourished. Within the Greek tradition and its successors it was traditional to separate mathematical astronomy (as typified by [[Ptolemy]]) from philosophical cosmology (as typified by [[Aristotle]]). Muslim scholars developed a program of seeking a physically real configuration (''hay'a'') of the universe, that would be consistent with both [[mathematics|mathematical]] and [[physics|physical]] principles.  Within the context of this ''hay'a'' tradition, Muslim astronomers began questioning technical details of the [[Ptolemaic system]] of astronomy.<ref>[[A. I. Sabra]] (1998), p. 293-8</ref> Most of these criticisms, however, continued to follow the Ptolemaic astronomical [[paradigm]], remaining within the [[geocentrism|geocentric]] framework.<ref>Dennis Duke, [http://people.scs.fsu.edu/~dduke/arabmars.html ''Arabic Models for outer Planets and Venus'']</ref>  As the historian of astronomy, [[A. I. Sabra]], noted:

{{quote|"All Islamic astronomers from [[Thabit ibn Qurra]] in the ninth century to [[Ibn al-Shatir]] in the fourteenth, and all natural philosophers from [[al-Kindi]] to [[Averroes]] and later, are known to have accepted what Kuhn has called the "two-sphere universe" ...&mdash;the Greek picture of the world as consisting of two spheres of which one, the [[celestial spheres|celestial sphere]] made up of a special element called [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], concentrically envelops the other, where the [[classical elements|four elements]] of earth, water, air, and fire reside."<ref>[[A. I. Sabra]] (1998), p. 317-18</ref>}}

Some Muslim astronomers, however, most notably [[Ab<U+016B> Rayh<U+0101>n al-B<U+012B>r<U+016B>n<U+012B>]] and [[Nas<U+012B>r al-D<U+012B>n al-T<U+016B>s<U+012B>]], discussed whether the Earth moved and considered how this might be consistent with astronomical computations and physical systems.<ref>Teresi, et al., (2002)</ref> Several other Muslim astronomers, most notably those following the [[Maragheh observatory|Maragheh school]] of thought, developed non-Ptolemaic computational models within a geocentric context that were later adapted in the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican model]] in a [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] context.

;''Refutations of astrology''

The first [[Semantics|semantic]] distinction between astronomy and [[Islamic astrology|astrology]] was given by the [[Persian people|Persian]] astronomer [[Ab<U+016B> Rayh<U+0101>n al-B<U+012B>r<U+016B>n<U+012B>|Abu Rayhan al-Biruni]] in the 11th century,<ref>S. Pines (September 1964). "The Semantic Distinction between the Terms Astronomy and Astrology according to al-Biruni", ''Isis'' '''55''' (3), p. 343-349.</ref> though he himself refuted astrology in another work. The study of astrology was also refuted by other Muslim astronomers at the time, including [[al-Farabi]], [[Ibn al-Haytham]], [[Avicenna]] and [[Averroes]]. Their reasons for refuting astrology were both due to the methods used by astrologers being [[conjectural]] rather than [[empirical]] and also due to the views of astrologers conflicting with orthodox [[Islam]].<ref>[[George Saliba]] (1994), ''A History of Arabic Astronomy: Planetary Theories During the Golden Age of Islam'', p. 60, 67-69. [[New York University Press]], ISBN 0814780237.</ref>

;''Astrophysics and celestial mechanics''

In [[astrophysics]] and [[celestial mechanics]], [[Ab<U+016B> Rayh<U+0101>n al-B<U+012B>r<U+016B>n<U+012B>]] described the Earth's [[gravitation]] as:<ref name=Khwarizm/>
{{quote|"The attraction of all things towards the centre of the earth."}}

Al-Biruni also discovered that gravity exists within the [[Astronomical object|heavenly bodies]] and [[celestial spheres]], and he criticized [[Aristotle]]'s views of them not having any [[levity]] or gravity and of [[circular motion]] being an [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|innate property]] of the heavenly bodies.<ref>Rafik Berjak and Muzaffar Iqbal, "Ibn Sina--Al-Biruni correspondence", ''Islam & Science'', June 2003.</ref>

In 1121, [[al-Khazini]], in his treatise ''The Book of the Balance of Wisdom'', states:<ref name=Zaimeche7>Salah Zaimeche PhD (2005). [http://www.muslimheritage.com/uploads/Merv.pdf Merv], p. 7. Foundation for Science Technology and Civilization.</ref>
{{quote|"For each heavy body of a known weight positioned at a certain distance from the centre of the universe, its gravity depends on the remoteness from the centre of the universe. For that reason, the gravities of bodies relate as their distances from the centre of the universe."}}

Al-Khazini was thus the first to propose the theory that the [[Gravitation|gravities]] of bodies vary depending on their distances from the centre of the Earth. This phenomenon was not proven until [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] in the 18th century.<ref name=Zaimeche7/>

;''Beginning of hay'a tradition''

[[Image:Ibn haithem portrait.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen) was a pioneer of the Muslim ''haya'' tradition of astronomy, presented the first critique and reform of [[Ptolemy]]'s model, and laid the theoretical foundations for modern [[telescope|telescopic]] astronomy.]]

Between 1025 and 1028, [[Ibn al-Haytham]] ([[Latin]]ized as Alhacen), began the ''hay'a'' tradition of Islamic astronomy with his ''Al-Shuku ala Batlamyus'' (''Doubts on Ptolemy''). While maintaining the physical reality of the [[geocentric model]], he was the first to criticise [[Ptolemy]]'s astronomical system, which he criticised on [[empirical]], [[observation]]al and [[experiment]]al grounds,<ref>[[A. I. Sabra]] (1998), "Configuring the Universe: Aporetic, Problem Solving, and Kinematic Modeling as Themes of Arabic Astronomy", ''Perspectives on Science'' '''6''' (3), p. 288-330 [300].</ref> and for relating actual physical motions to imaginary mathematical points, lines and circles:
{{quote|"Ptolemy assumed an arrangement that cannot exist, and the fact that this arrangement produces in his imagination the motions that belong to the planets does not free him from the error he committed in his assumed arrangement, for the existing motions of the planets cannot be the result of an arrangement that is impossible to exist."<ref>[http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/stanford/entries/copernicus/index.html Nicolaus Copernicus]. [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (2004).</ref>}}

Ibn al-Haytham developed a physical structure of the Ptolemaic system in his ''Treatise on the configuration of the World'', or ''Maq<U+00E2>lah f<U+00EE> ''hay'at'' al-<U+201B><U+00E2>lam'', which became an influential work in the ''hay'a'' tradition.<ref>Y.

In 1038, Ibn al-Haytham described the first non-Ptolemaic configuration in ''The Model of the Motions''.

[[Image:AverroesColor.jpg|thumb|[[Averroes]] rejected the [[Deferent and epicycle|eccentric deferents]] introduced by [[Ptolemy]]. He rejected the [[Ptolemaic model]] and instead argued for a strictly [[concentric]] model of the universe.]]

In the 11th-12th centuries, astronomers in [[al-Andalus]] took up the challenge earlier posed by Ibn al-Haytham, namely to develop an alternate non-Ptolemaic configuration that evaded the errors found in the [[Geocentric model|Ptolemaic model]].<ref>George Saliba (1981). "''Geschichte des arabischen Schriftiums. Band VI: Astronomie bis ca. 430 H'' by F.

In the late 11th century, [[Arzachel|al-Zarqali]] (Latinized as Arzachel) discovered that the orbits of the planets are [[elliptic orbit]]s and not circular orbits,<ref>[[Robert Briffault]] (1938). ''The Making of Humanity'', p. 190.</ref> though he still followed the Ptolemaic model.

In the 12th century, [[Averroes]] rejected the [[Deferent and epicycle|eccentric deferents]] introduced by [[Ptolemy]]. He rejected the [[Ptolemaic model]] and instead argued for a strictly [[concentric]] model of the universe. He wrote the following criticism on the Ptolemaic model of planetary motion:<ref>Owen Gingerich (April 1986). "Islamic astronomy", ''Scientific American'' '''254''' (10), p. 74.</ref>

{{quote|"To assert the existence of an eccentric sphere or an epicyclic sphere is contrary to nature. [...] The astronomy of our time offers no truth, but only agrees with the calculations and not with what exists."}}

Averroes' contemporary, [[Maimonides]], wrote the following on the planetary model proposed by [[Ibn Bajjah]] (Avempace):

{{quote|"I have heard that Abu Bakr [Ibn Bajja] discovered a system in which no [[Deferent and epicycle|epicycles]] occur, but [[Eccentricity|eccentric]] spheres are not excluded by him. I have not heard it from his pupils; and even if it be correct that he discovered such a system, he has not gained much by it, for eccentricity is likewise contrary to the principles laid down by [[Aristotle]].... I have explained to you that these difficulties do not concern the astronomer, for he does not profess to tell us the existing properties of the spheres, but to suggest, whether correctly or not, a theory in which the motion of the stars and planets is uniform and circular, and in agreement with observation."<ref>Bernard R. Goldstein (March 1972). "Theory and Observation in Medieval Astronomy", ''Isis'' '''63''' (1), p. 39-47 [40-41].</ref>}}

Later in the 12th century, Ibn Bajjah's successors, [[Ibn Tufail]] (Abubacer) and [[Nur Ed-Din Al Betrugi|al-Betrugi]] (Alpetragius), were the first to propose planetary models without any [[equant]], [[Deferent and epicycle|epicycles or eccentrics]].

The "Maragha Revolution" refers to the achievements of the "Maragha school", an astronomical tradition beginning in the [[Maragha]] observatory and continuing with astronomers from [[Damascus]], [[Samarkand]] and [[Istanbul]]. Like their Andalusian predecessors, the Maragha astronomers attempted to solve the [[equant]] problem and produce alternative configurations to the [[Ptolemaic model]]. They were more successful than their Andalusian predecessors in producing non-Ptolemaic configurations which eliminated the equant and [[Eccentricity|eccentrics]], were more accurate than the Ptolemaic model in numerically predicting planetary positions, and were in better agreement with [[empirical]] [[observation]]s.<ref name=Saliba-1994>[[George Saliba]] (1994), ''A History of Arabic Astronomy: Planetary Theories During the Golden Age of Islam'', p. 233-234, 240. [[New York University Press]], ISBN 0814780237.</ref> The most important of the Maragha astronomers included [[Mo'ayyeduddin Urdi]] (d. 1266), [[Nas<U+012B>r al-D<U+012B>n al-T<U+016B>s<U+012B>]] (1201-1274), 'Umar al-Katibi al-[[Qazwini]] (d. 1277), [[Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi]] (1236-1311), Sadr al-Sharia al-Bukhari (c. 1347), [[Ibn al-Shatir]] (1304-1375), Ali al-Qushji (c. 1474), and Shams al-Din al-Khafri (d. 1550).<ref>Dallal (1999), pg. 171</ref>

Some have described their achievements in the 13th and 14th centuries as a "Maragha Revolution", "Maragha School Revolution", or "[[Scientific Revolution]] before the [[Renaissance]]". An important aspect of this [[revolution]] included the realization that astronomy should aim to describe the behaviour of [[Physical body|physical bodies]] in [[Islamic mathematics|mathematical]] language, and should not remain a mathematical [[hypothesis]], which would only save the [[phenomena]]. The Maragha astronomers also realized that the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] view of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] in the universe being only circular or [[linear]] was not true, as the [[Tusi-couple]] showed that linear motion could also be produced by applying [[circular motion]]s only.<ref>[[George Saliba]] (1994), ''A History of Arabic Astronomy: Planetary Theories During the Golden Age of Islam'', p. 245, 250, 256-257.

[[Mo'ayyeduddin Urdi]] (d. 1266)  was the first of the Maragheh astronomers to develop a non-Ptolemaic model, and he proposed a new theorem, the "Urdi lemma".<ref>[[George Saliba]] (1979).

Gill (2005), [http://www.chowk.com/articles/9489 Was Muslim Astronomy the Harbinger of Copernicanism?]</ref> and conceived a plausible model for [[ellipse|elliptical]] orbits.<ref name=Covington>Richard Covington (2007).</ref> Tusi's student [[Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi]] (1236-1311), in his ''The Limit of Accomplishment concerning Knowledge of the Heavens'', discussed the possibility of [[heliocentrism]]. 'Umar al-Katibi al-[[Qazwini]] (d. 1277), who also worked at the Maragheh observatory, in his ''Hikmat al-'Ain'', wrote an argument for a heliocentric model, though he later abandoned the idea.<ref name=Baker/>

[[Ibn al-Shatir]] ([[1304]]<U+2013>[[1375]]) of [[Damascus]], in ''A Final Inquiry Concerning the Rectification of Planetary Theory'', incorporated the Urdi lemma, and eliminated the need for an equant by introducing an extra epicycle (the Tusi-couple), departing from the Ptolemaic system in a way that was mathematically identical to what [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] did in the 16th century. Ibn al-Shatir's model was in better agreement with empirical observations than any previous model,<ref name=Saliba-1994/> was also the first that permitted empirical [[Experiment|testing]].<ref>Y. M.

An area of active discussion in the Maragheh school, and later the [[Samarkand]] and [[Istanbul]] observatories, was the possibility of the [[Earth's rotation]]. Supporters of this theory included [[Nas<U+012B>r al-D<U+012B>n al-T<U+016B>s<U+012B>]], Nizam al-Din al-Nisaburi (c. 1311), al-Sayyid al-Sharif al-Jurjani (1339-1413), Ali al-Qushji (d. 1474), and Abd al-Ali al-Birjandi (d. 1525). Al-Tusi was the first to present empirical observational evidence of the Earth's rotation, using the location of [[comet]]s relevant to the Earth as evidence, which al-Qushji elaborated on with further empirical observations while rejecting [[Aristotelian]] [[natural philosophy]] altogether. Both of their arguments were similar to the arguments later used by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] in 1543 to explain the Earth's rotation.<ref name=Ragep>F. Jamil Ragep (2001), "Tusi and Copernicus: The Earth's Motion in Context", ''Science in Context'' '''14''' (1-2), p. 145<U+2013>163. [[Cambridge University Press]].</ref>

===1450-1900===
This is the period of stagnation, when the traditional system of astronomy continued to be practised with enthusiasm, but with decreasing innovation. It was believed there was no innovation of major significance during this period, but this view has been questioned by historians of astronomy in recent times.

;''Earth's motion''

The work of Ali al-Qushji (d. 1474), who worked at [[Samarkand]] and then [[Istanbul]], is seen as a late example of innovation in Islamic astronomy and it is believed he may have had an influence on [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] due to similar arguments concerning the [[Earth's rotation]]. Before al-Qushji, the only astronomer to present an [[Empiricism|empirical]] argument for the Earth's rotation was [[Nas<U+012B>r al-D<U+012B>n al-T<U+016B>s<U+012B>]] (d. 1274), who used the phenomena of [[comet]]s to refute [[Ptolemy]]'s claim that a stationery Earth can be determined through observation alone. Al-Tusi, however, accepted that the Earth was stationery on the basis of [[natural philosophy]] instead, particularly [[Aristotelian physics]]. In the 15th century, the influence of Aristotelian physics and natural philosophy was declining due to religious opposition. Al-Qushji thus rejected Aristotelian physics and completely separated natural philosophy from astronomy, allowing astronomy to become a purely empirical and mathematical science. This allowed him to explore alternatives to the Aristotelian notion of a stationery Earth, as he explored the idea of a moving Earth. He elaborated on al-Tusi's argument and concluded, on the basis of [[empiricism]] rather than speculative philosophy, that the moving Earth theory is just as likely to be true as the stationary Earth theory.<ref name=Ragep/><ref>F.

;''Later astronomers''

[[George Saliba]] studied the works of the 16th century astronomer Shams al-Din al-Khafri (d. 1550), a commentator on earlier [[Maragheh observatory|Maragheh astronomers]]. Saliba wrote the following on al-Khafri's work:

{{quote|"By his sheer insight into the role of mathematics in describing natural phenomena, this astronomer managed to bring the hay'a tradition to such unparalleled heights that could not be matched anywhere else in the world at that time neither mathematically nor astronomically. By working on the alternative mathematical models that could replace those of Ptolemy, and by scrutinizing the works of his predecessors who were all searching for unique mathematical models that could describe the physical phenomena consistently, this astronomer finally realized that all mathematical modeling had no physical truth by itself and was simply another language with which one could describe the physical observed reality. He also realized that the specific phenomena that were being described by the Ptolemaic models did not have unique mathematical solutions that were subject to the same restraints. Rather there were several mathematical models that could account for the Ptolemaic observations, yield identical predictive results at the same critical points used by Ptolemy to construct his own models (thus accounting for the observations as perfectly as Ptolemy could) and still meet the consistency requirement that was imposed by the Aristotelian cosmology which was adopted by the writers in the ''hay'a'' tradition."<ref>Saliba (2000).</ref>}}

Another notable 16th century Muslim astronomer was [[Taqi al-Din]], who built the [[Istanbul observatory of al-Din]] in 1577, where he carried out astronomical observations until 1580. He produced a [[zij]] (named ''Unbored Pearl'') and [[astronomical catalog]]ues that were more accurate than those of his contemporaries, [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]. Taqi al-Din was also the first astronomer to employ a [[Decimal separator|decimal point]] notation in his [[observation]]s rather than the [[sexagesimal]] fractions used by his contemporaries and predecessors.<ref name=Tekeli>Sevim Tekeli, "Taqi al-Din", in Helaine Selin (1997), ''Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures'', [[Kluwer Academic Publishers]], ISBN 0792340663.</ref>

===1900-present===
After the 16th century, there were no more significant astronomical innovations from the Islamic world until the 20th century, when Muslim [[rocket scientist]]s from [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Central Asia]] were involved in research on [[astronautics]] and [[space exploration]].

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, there have also been a number of Muslim astronauts, the first being [[Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]] as a [[Payload Specialist]] aboard [[STS-51-G]] [[Space Shuttle Discovery]], followed by [[Muhammed Faris]] aboard [[Soyuz TM-2]] and [[Soyuz TM-3]] to [[Mir]] [[space station]]; [[Abdul Ahad Mohmand]] aboard [[Soyuz TM-5]] to Mir; [[Talgat Musabayev]] (one of the [[Spaceflight records#Total time in space|top 25 astronauts by time in space]]) as a [[flight engineer]] aboard [[Soyuz TM-19]] to Mir, commander of [[Soyuz TM-27]] to Mir, and commander of [[Soyuz TM-32]] and [[Soyuz TM-31]] to [[International Space Station]] (ISS); and [[Anousheh Ansari]], the first woman to travel to ISS and the fourth [[space tourist]].

==Observatories==
The modern astronomical [[observatory]] as a [[research institute]] (rather than just a location) was first introduced by medieval Muslim astronomers. The Islamic observatory was the first specialized astronomical institution with its own scientific [[staff]], [[#Instruments|astronomical instruments]], and building where astronomical [[research]] and [[observation]]s are carried out. Islamic observatories were also the first to employ enormously large astronomical instruments in order to improve the accuracy of their observations.<ref>E. S. Kennedy (1962), "Reviewed Work: ''The Observatory in Islam and Its Place in the General History of the Observatory'' by Aydin Sayili", ''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]'' '''53''' (2): 237-239.</ref>

The Islamic observatories were similar to modern scientific research institutions, in that "group research was emphasized," and "theoretical investigations went hand in hand with observations."<ref>Prof. Osman Bakar ([[Georgetown University]]), [http://www.al-huda.com/Article_5%205.htm Islam's Contribution to Human Civilization: Science and Culture], CIC's annual Ottawa dinner, October 15, 2001.</ref>

===Early observatories===
The first systematic observations in Islam are reported to have taken place under the patronage of [[al-Ma'mun]], and the first Islamic observatories were built in 9th century [[Iraq]] under his patronage.

In many private observatories from [[Damascus]] to [[Baghdad]], [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] degrees were measured, solar parameters were established, and detailed observations of the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and [[planets]] were undertaken.  

In the 10th century, the [[Buwayhid]] dynasty encouraged the undertaking of extensive works in Astronomy, such as the construction of a large scale instrument with which observations were made in the year 950. We know of this by recordings made in the ''zij'' of astronomers such as Ibn al-Alam. The great astronomer [[Abd Al-Rahman Al Sufi]] was patronised by prince [[Adud o-dowleh]], who systematically revised [[Ptolemy]]'s catalogue of [[star]]s. [[Sharaf al-Daula]] also established a similar observatory in [[Baghdad]]. And reports by [[Ibn Yunus]] and [[al-Zarqall]] in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and [[C<U+00F3>rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] indicate the use of sophisticated instruments for their time.

It was [[Malik Shah I]] who established the first large observatory, probably in [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]]. It was here where [[Omar Khayy<U+00E1>m]] with many other collaborators constructed a [[zij]] and formulated the [[Iranian calendar|Persian solar calendar]], a.k.a. the ''jalali calendar'', the most accurate [[solar calendar]] to date. A modern version of this calendar is still in official use in [[Iran]] today.

===Late medieval observatories===
[[Image:Ulugh.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ulugh Beg]], founder of a large Islamic observatory in [[Samarkand]], honoured on this [[Soviet]] stamp.]]

The more influential observatories, however, were established beginning in the 13th century. The [[Maragheh observatory]] was founded by [[Nas<U+012B>r al-D<U+012B>n al-T<U+016B>s<U+012B>]] under the patronage of [[Hulegu Khan]] in the 13th century. Here, al-Tusi supervised its technical construction at [[Maragheh]]. The facility contained resting quarters for [[Hulagu Khan]], as well as a library and mosque. Some of the top astronomers of the day gathered there, and from their collaboration resulted important modifications to the [[Ptolemaic system]] over a period of 50 years.

In 1420, prince [[Ulugh Beg]], himself an astronomer and mathematician, founded another large observatory in [[Samarkand]], the remains of which were excavated in 1908 by Russian teams. And finally, [[Taqi al-Din]] bin Ma'ruf founded the large [[Istanbul observatory of al-Din]] in 1577, which was on the same scale as those in Maragha and Samarkand.

===Modern observatories===
In modern times, many well-equipped observatories can be found in [[Jordan]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jas.org.jo/index2.html|title=Jordanian Astronomical Society|accessdate=2008-01-15}}</ref> [[Palestine]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pas.ps/maine.htm|title=Palestinian Astronomical Society|accessdate=2008-01-15}}</ref> [[Lebanon]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Hall/6865|title=Lebanese Astronomical society|accessdate=2008-01-15}}</ref> [[UAE]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.falak.ae|title=Emirates Astronomical Society|accessdate=2008-01-15}}</ref> [[Tunisia]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.satunisia.info/angstro.htm|title=Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Astronomique de Tunise|accessdate=2008-01-15}}</ref> and other Arab states are also active as well. [[Iran]] has modern facilities at [[Shiraz University]] and [[Tabriz University]].

==Instruments==
{{see also|Inventions in the Muslim world}}
[[Image:Astrolabium.jpg|thumb|A [[Persia]]n ([[Iran]]ian) astrolabe from [[1208]] ]]

Modern knowledge of the instruments used by Muslim astronomers primarily comes from two sources. First the remaining instruments in private and museum collections today, and second the treatises and manuscripts preserved from the Middle Ages.

Muslims made many improvements to instruments already in use before their time, such as adding new scales or details, and invented many of their own new instruments. Their contributions to astronomical instrumentation are abundant. Many of these instruments were often invented or designed for [[Islam]]ic purposes, such as the determination of the direction of [[Qibla]] or the times of [[Salah]].

===Astrolabes===
Brass [[astrolabe]]s were developed in much of the [[Islamic]] world, chiefly as an aid to finding the [[qibla]]. The [http://www.soas.ac.uk/visitors/gallery/previous/islamicpatronage/popup25732.html earliest known example] is dated 315 (in the [[Islamic calendar]], corresponding to 927-8CE). The first person credited for building the Astrolabe in the Islamic world is reportedly [[Al-Fazari, Mohammad|Fazari]].<ref>[[Richard Nelson Frye]], ''Golden Age of Persia'', p. 163.</ref> Though the first primitive astrolabe to chart the stars was invented in the [[Hellenistic civilization]], al-Fazari made several improvements to the device. The Arabs then took it during the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliphate]] and perfected it to be used to find the beginning of [[Ramadan]], the hours of [[prayer]] ([[Salah]]), the direction of [[Mecca]] ([[Qibla]]), and over a thousand other uses.<ref name=Winterburn/>

In the 10th century, [[al-Sufi]] first described over 1000 different uses of an astrolabe, in areas as diverse as [[astronomy]], [[Islamic astrology|astrology, horoscope]]s, [[Mariner's astrolabe|navigation]], [[surveying]], [[time]]keeping, [[Qibla]], [[Salah]], etc.<ref name=Winterburn>Dr. Emily Winterburn ([[National Maritime Museum]]), [http://www.muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=529 Using an Astrolabe], Foundation for Science Technology and Civilisation, 2005.</ref>

;''Large astrolabe''

[[Ibn Yunus]] accurately observed more than 10,000 entries for the sun's position for many years using a large astrolabe with a diameter of nearly 1.4 metres.<ref name=Zaimeche/>

;''Mechanical geared astrolabe''

The first [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]] astrolabes with [[gear]]s were invented in the Muslim world, and were perfected by Ibn Samh (c. 1020). One such device with eight [[gear]]-wheels was also constructed by [[Ab<U+016B> Rayh<U+0101>n al-B<U+012B>r<U+016B>n<U+012B>]] in 996. These can be considered as an ancestor of the [[mechanical clock]]s developed by later Muslim engineers.<ref>[http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/introduction/woi_knowledge.html Islam, Knowledge, and Science.] [[University of Southern California]].</ref>

;''Navigational astrolabe''

The first [[Mariner's astrolabe|navigational astrolabe]] was invented in the Islamic world during the [[Middle Ages]], and employed the use of a [[Polar coordinate system|polar]] [[Map projection|projection]] system.<ref>Robert Hannah (1997). "''The Mapping of the Heavens'' by Peter Whitfield", ''Imago Mundi'' '''49''', p. 161-162.</ref>

[[Ab<U+016B> Rayh<U+0101>n al-B<U+012B>r<U+016B>n<U+012B>|Abu Rayhan al-Biruni]] invented and wrote the earliest treatise on the [[Orthographic projection (cartography)|orthographical]] astrolabe in the [[1000s]].<ref name=Khwarizm>[http://muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=482 Khwarizm], Foundation for Science Technology and Civilisation.</ref>

;''Saphaea and Zuraqi''

The first astrolabe instruments were used to read the rise of the time of rise of the [[Sun]] and fixed stars. In the 11th century, [[Arzachel]] (al-Zarqali) of [[al-Andalus]] constructed the first universal astrolabe which, unlike its predecessors, did not depend on the [[latitude]] of the observer, and could be used anywhere on the Earth. This universal astrolabe instrument became known in Europe as the "Saphaea". Another astrolabe, the Zuraqi is a unique astrolabe invented by [[al-Sijzi]] for a [[heliocentric]] planetary model in which the Earth is moving rather than the sky.<ref name=Nasr/>

;''Linear astrolabe''

A famous work by [[Sharaf al-D<U+012B>n al-T<U+016B>s<U+012B>]] is one in which he describes the linear astrolabe, sometimes called the "staff of al-Tusi", which he invented.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-342088/linear-astrolabe Linear astrolabe], ''[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]''.</ref>

===Analog computers===
[[Image:planisphere.jpg|thumb|A [[planisphere]].]]

Various [[analog computer]] devices were invented to compute the [[latitude]]s of the Sun, Moon, and planets, the [[ecliptic]] of the Sun, the time of day at which [[planetary conjunction]]s will occur and for performing [[linear interpolation]].

;''Equatorium''

The [[Equatorium]] was an [[analog computer]] invented by [[Ab<U+016B> Ish<U+0101>q Ibr<U+0101>h<U+012B>m al-Zarq<U+0101>l<U+012B>]] (Arzachel) in [[al-Andalus]], probably around 1015 CE. It is a mechanical device for finding the [[longitude]]s and positions of the [[Moon]], [[Sun]], and [[planet]]s, without calculation using a geometrical model to represent the [[celestial body]]'s mean and anomalistic position.<ref>[[Ahmad Y Hassan]], [http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%2071.htm Transfer Of Islamic Technology To The West, Part II: Transmission Of Islamic Engineering]</ref>

;''Plate of Conjunctions''

In the 15th century, [[al-Kashi]] invented the Plate of Conjunctions, a computing instrument used to determine the time of day at which [[planetary conjunction]]s will occur,<ref>E. S. Kennedy (1947), "Al-Kashi's Plate of Conjunctions", ''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]'' '''38''' (1-2), p. 56-59 [56].</ref> and for performing [[linear interpolation]].<ref name=Kennedy/>

;''Planetary computer''

In the 15th century, [[al-Kashi]] also invented a mechanical planetary computer which he called the Plate of Zones, which could graphically solve a number of planetary problems, including the prediction of the true positions in [[longitude]] of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]],<ref name=Kennedy>E. S. Kennedy (1950), "A Fifteenth-Century Planetary Computer: al-Kashi's Tabaq al-Manateq I. Motion of the Sun and Moon in Longitude", ''Isis'' '''41''' (2), p. 180-183.</ref> and the [[planet]]s in terms of [[elliptical orbit]]s;<ref>E. S. Kennedy (1952), "A Fifteenth-Century Planetary Computer: al-Kashi's Tabaq al-Maneteq II: Longitudes, Distances, and Equations of the Planets", ''Isis'' '''43''' (1), p. 42-50.</ref> the [[latitude]]s of the Sun, Moon, and planets; and the [[ecliptic]] of the Sun. The instrument also incorporated an [[alhidade]] and [[ruler]].<ref>E. S. Kennedy (1951), "An Islamic Computer for Planetary Latitudes", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''71''' (1), p. 13-21.</ref>

===Armillary spheres===
[[Image:Armillary sphere.png|thumb|An [[armillary sphere]].]]

An [[armillary sphere]] had similar applications to a [[celestial globe]]. No early Islamic armillary spheres survive, but several treatises on <U+201C>the instrument with the rings<U+201D> were written. 

;''Spherical astrolabe''

The [[spherical astrolabe]] was first produced in the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic world]].<ref>Emilie Savage-Smith (1993). "Book Reviews", ''Journal of Islamic Studies'' '''4''' (2), p. 296-299.
{{quote|"There is no evidence for the Hellenistic origin of the spherical astrolabe, but rather evidence so far available suggests that it may have been an early but distinctly Islamic development with no Greek antecedents."}}</ref> It was an Islamic variation of the astrolabe and the armillary sphere, of which only one complete instrument, from the 14th century, has survived.

;''Celestial globes''

[[Celestial globe]]s were used primarily for solving problems in celestial astronomy. Today, 126 such instruments remain worldwide, the oldest from the 11th century. The altitude of the sun, or the [[Right Ascension]] and [[Declination]] of stars could be calculated with these by inputting the location of the observer on the [[meridian]] ring of the globe.

===Astronomical clocks===
The Muslims constructed a variety of highly accurate [[astronomical clock]]s for use in their observatories.<ref>Ajram (1992).</ref>

;''Water-powered astronomical clocks''

[[Al-Jazari]] invented monumental [[Water clock|water-powered]] [[astronomical clock]]s which displayed moving models of the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and [[star]]s. His largest astronomical clock displayed the [[zodiac]] and the [[Heliocentric orbit|solar]] and [[lunar orbit]]s. Another innovative feature of the clock was a [[pointer]] which traveled across the top of a [[gate]]way and caused automatic [[door]]s to open every [[hour]].<ref>[[Donald Routledge Hill]], "Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East", ''Scientific American'', May 1991, p. 64-69. ([[cf.]] [[Donald Routledge Hill]], [http://home.swipnet.se/islam/articles/HistoryofSciences.htm Mechanical Engineering])</ref>

;''Mechanical observational clock''

Taqi al-Din invented the "observational clock", which he described as "a [[mechanical clock]] with three [[dial]]s which show the [[hour]]s, the [[minute]]s, and the [[second]]s." He used this for [[Astronomical clock|astronomical purposes]], specifically for measuring the [[right ascension]] of the [[star]]s. This is considered one of the most important innovations in 16th century practical astronomy, as previous [[clock]]s were not accurate enough to be used for astronomical purposes.<ref name=Tekeli/>

===Dials===
Muslim astronomers and engineers invented a variety of [[dial]]s for [[timekeeping]], and for determining the times of the [[Salat|five daily prayers]].

;''Sundials''

Muslims made several important improvements to the theory and construction of [[sundial]]s, which they inherited from their [[Indian astronomy|Indian]] and [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] predecessors. [[Al-Khwarizmi]] made tables for these instruments which considerably shortened the time needed to make specific calculations. Muslim sundials could also be observed from anywhere on the Earth. Sundials were frequently placed on mosques to determine the [[Salah|time of prayer]].  One of the most striking examples was built in the 14th century by the ''muwaqqit'' (timekeeper) of the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in [[Damascus]], [[Ibn al-Shatir]].<ref>David A. King, "Islamic Astronomy", p. 168-9.</ref> Muslim astronomers and engineers were the first to write instructions on the construction of horizantal sundials, vertical sundials, and polar sundials.<ref name=King-Astronomy>David A.

;''Navicula de Venetiis''

This was a universal horary [[dial]] invented in 9th century [[Baghdad]]. It was used for accurate timekeeping by the Sun and Stars, and could be observed from any [[latitude]].<ref>David A. King, ''Studies in Astronomical Timekeeping in Medieval Islamic Civilization'', E. J. Brill.</ref> This was later known in Europe as the "Navicula de Venetiis",<ref>David A. King (December 2003). "14th-Century England or 9th-Century Baghdad? New Insights on the Elusive Astronomical Instrument Called Navicula de Venetiis", ''Centaurus'' '''45''' (1-4), p. 204-226.</ref> which was considered the most sophisticated timekeeping instrument of the [[Renaissance]].<ref name=King/>

;''Compass dial''

In the 13th century, [[Ibn al-Shatir]] invented the [[compass dial]], a [[time]]keeping device incorporating both a universal [[sundial]] and a magnetic [[compass]]. He invented for the purpose of finding the times of [[Salah]].<ref>David A. King (1983). "The Astronomy of the Mamluks", [[Isis (journal)|Isis]]'' '''74''' (4), p. 531-555 [547-548].</ref>

===Mural instruments===
A number of [[mural instrument]]s (including several different [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrants]]) were invented by Muslim astronomers and engineers.

;''Sine quadrant''

The sine quadrant, invented by [[Muhammad ibn M<U+016B>s<U+0101> al-Khw<U+0101>rizm<U+012B>]] in 9th century [[Baghdad]], was used for astronomical calculations.<ref name=King-2002/>

;''Horary quadrant''

The first horary [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] for specific [[latitude]]s, was invented by [[Muhammad ibn M<U+016B>s<U+0101> al-Khw<U+0101>rizm<U+012B>]] in 9th century Baghdad, center of the development of quadrants.<ref name=King-2002/> It was used to determine time (especially the times of prayer) by observations of the Sun or stars.<ref>[[David A. King]], "Islamic Astronomy", in Christopher Walker (1999), ed., ''Astronomy before the telescope'', p. 167-168. [[British Museum]] Press. ISBN 0-7141-2733-7.</ref>

;''Quadrans Novus''

Quadrans Vetus was a universal horary [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]], an ingeniuous mathematical device invented by [[al-Khwarizmi]] in 9th century [[Baghdad]] and later known as the "Quadrans Vetus" (Old Quadrant) in medieval Europe from the 13th century. It could be used for any [[latitude]] on Earth and at any time of the year to determine the time in hours from the [[altitude]] of the Sun. This was the second most widely used astronomical instrument during the [[Middle Ages]] after the [[astrolabe]]. One of its main purposes in the Islamic world was to determine the times of [[Salah]].<ref name=King-2002>David A. King (2002).

"A Recently Discovered Sixteenth-Century Spanish Astrolabe", ''Annals of Science'' '''59''' (4), p. 331-362 [333].</ref>

;''Almucantar quadrant''

The first [[almucantar]] [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] was invented in the medieval Islamic world, and it employed the use of [[trigonometry]]. The term "almucantar" is itself derived from Arabic.<ref>Elly Dekker (1995), "An unrecorded medieval astrolabe quadrant from c. 1300", ''Annals of Science'' '''52''' (1), p. 1-47 [6].</ref> The Almucantar quadrant was originally modified from the [[astrolabe]].<ref name=King-Astronomy/>

;''Sextant''

The first [[Sextant (astronomical)|sextant]] was constructed in [[Ray, Iran]], by [[Abu-Mahmud al-Khujandi]] in [[994]]. It was a very large sextant that achieved a high level of accuracy for [[astronomy|astronomical]] measurements, which he described his in his treatise, ''On the obliquity of the ecliptic and the latitudes of the cities''.<ref>{{MacTutor|id=Al-Khujandi|title=Al-Khujandi}}</ref> In the 15th century, [[Ulugh Beg]] constructed the "Fakhri Sextant", which had a radius of approximately 36 meters. Constructed in [[Samarkand]], [[Uzbekistan]], the arc was finely constructed with a staircase on either side to provide access for the assistants who performed the measurements.

===Other instruments===
Various other astrononmical instruments were also invented in the Islamic world:

*The first astronomical uses of the magnetic [[compass]] is found in a treatise on astronomical instruments written by the [[Yemen]]i [[sultan]] al-[[Ashraf]] (d. 1296). This was the first reference to the compass in astronomical literature.<ref>Emilie Savage-Smith (1988), "Gleanings from an Arabist's Workshop: Current Trends in the Study of Medieval Islamic Science and Medicine", ''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]'' '''79''' (2), p. 246-266 [263].</ref>
[[Image:Alidade for ceiling projector.JPG|right|thumb|An [[alidade]].]]
*The [[Alhidade]] was invented in the Islamic world, while the term "alhidade" is itself derived from Arabic.
*A [[compendium]] was a multi-purpose astronomical instrument, first constructed by the Muslim astronomer [[Ibn al-Shatir]] in the 13th century. His compendium featured an [[alhidade]] and polar [[sundial]] among other things. Al-Wafa'i developed another compendium in the 15th century which he called the "equitorial circle", which also featured a horizontal sundial. These compendia later became popular in [[Renaissance]] Europe.<ref name=King-Astronomy/>
*Islamic [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrants]] used for various astronomical and timekeeping purposes from the 10th century introduced [[orthogonal]] and [[regular grid]]s and markings that are identical to modern [[graph paper]].<ref>Josef W.
