The '''State of Vietnam referendum of 1955''' determined the [[form of government]] of the [[State of Vietnam]], the nation that was to become the [[Republic of Vietnam]]. It was contested by Prime Minister [[Ngo Dinh Diem]], who proposed a republic, and [[Bao Dai]], the [[Emperor of Vietnam]] who was running on a monarchist platform. Diem won the election with 98.2% of the vote, which was widely marred by [[electoral fraud]]. Diem was credited with over 133% of the number of registered voters in the capital [[Saigon]].<ref name="karnow"/><ref name="encyc">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War|first=Spencer C.|last=Tucker|year=2000|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|pages=366|isbn=1-57607-040-0}}</ref> The referendum was the last phase in the power struggle between Bao Dai and his Prime Minister. Bao Dai disliked Diem and had frequently attempted to undermine him, seeing him only as a conduit to American aid. Diem subdued the private armies of opposition religious sects and organised criminals despite Bao Dai's interference. Emboldened with his success, he began to plot Diem's downfall. He scheduled the referendum for [[October 23]], [[1955]], which Bao Dai attempted to derail, and pushed the emperor out of the political scene. Diem proclaimed himself President of the new [[Republic of Vietnam]] after his brother [[Ngo Dinh Nhu]] successfully rigged the poll.

==Background==
{{Main|Geneva Conference (1954)|Operation Passage to Freedom|Battle for Saigon}}
The defeat of the [[French Army]] at [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|Dien Bien Phu]] in 1954 and the subsequent [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Accords]] ended French colonisation of [[Vietnam]]. The French colonial forces, which had run the country through the  [[State of Vietnam]] and the titular [[Nguyen Dynasty]] Emperor [[Bao Dai]], provisionally held control in South Vietnam south of the 17th parallel. [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s [[Vietminh]] held the north under the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]], which Ho proclaimed in 1955. Elections were to be held in 1956 to unify the country under a common government. Bao Dai appointed Diem as Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam in July 1954. After a period of three hundred days during which free passage between both sides was allowed, the border was closed on [[October 11]], [[1954]]. Catholic Ngo Dinh Diem and his U.S. and [[CIA]] adviser [[Edward Lansdale]] campaigned using the slogan "God has gone south" to attract Catholics to strengthen his power base. 850,000 people migrated to the south, mostly Catholics. At the start of 1955, [[French Indochina]] was dissolved, leaving Diem in temporary control of the south.<ref>{{cite book|title=Vietnam:The ten thousand day was|first=Michael|last=Maclear|year=1981|publisher=[[Methuen]]|pages=65-68|isbn=0-423-00580-4}}</ref>

At the time Diem had little authority beyond the gates of his own palace gates. Bao Dai had little confidence in him and gave him little support, with Diem having resigned as his Interior Minister two decades earlier believing Bao Dai to be weak and ineffective. Most historians felt that Bao Dai selected Diem because he would bring with him US support and funding.<ref>Jacobs, p. 39.</ref> The [[Hoa Hao]] and [[Cao Dai]] religious sects had private armies which controlled the [[Mekong Delta]] and the areas west of [[Saigon]] respectively. The [[Binh Xuyen]] was an armed organised crime empire that controlled much of Saigon with 40,000 strong private army, while the Vietminh still controlled much of the rural area. Bao Dai. Diem's [[Vietnamese National Army]] was lead by General [[Nguyen Van Hinh]], a French citizen who loathed him and frequently disobeyed him. To compound matters, Bao Dai sold the license of the national police to the Binh Xuyen.<ref>Jacobs, p. 61&ndash;62.</ref>

With growing French and US skepticism in his ability to take control of the country, Diem forced the matter to a head in April 1955. He gave the Binh Xuyen an ultimatum to submit to his command through the VNA and relinquish control of the National Police or he would attack. He also slowly began to bribe Hoa Hao and Cao Dai commanders into joining the VNA. The Binh Xuyen refused and on [[April 27]], the VNA initiated the [[Battle for Saigon]]. After a brief but violent battle which killed between 500 and 1000 and left around 20,000 homeless, the Binh Xuyen were crushed and Diem regained US confidence and control of the police. Jubilant crowds lauded Diem and denounced Bao Dai.<ref>Jacobs, p. 71&ndash;79.</ref> Buoyed by his successes, Diem became more confident as he went about accumulating more power for himself. On [[May 15]], Diem abolished Bao Dai<U+2019>s Imperial Guard; its 5,000 men became the 11th and 42nd Infantry Regiments of the National Army. Diem then stripped Bao Dai of his extensive crown lands. On [[June 15]], Diem got the Council of the Royal Family at Hue to decide that Bao Dai be stripped of his powers and that Diem be made President.<ref name="butt"/>

==Campaign==
[[Image:Major-general-lansdale.jpg|Colonel [[Edward Lansdale]] helped Diem in his campaign.|left|170px|left|thumb]]
On [[July 7]], the first anniversary of his installation as Prime Minister, Diem announced that a national referendum would be held on [[October 23]], [[1955]].<ref name="butt"/> It was contested by [[Bao Dai]], the Emperor who had spent the majority of his ceremonial reign during the colonial period in [[France]], advocating the restoration of the monarchy. Diem ran on a republican platform. Lansdale had cautioned Diem against electoral fraud, believing that Diem would win a free election, stating "While I'm away I don't want to suddenly read that you have won by 99.99%. I would know that it's rigged then." American officials suggested that a fair election would have seen Diem poll around 60-70% of the vote.<ref name="karnow">{{cite book|title=Vietnam:A history|first=Stanley|last=Karnow|year=1997|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|pages=239|isbn=0-670-84218-4}}</ref>

Campaigning for Bao Dai was prohibited, and Diem's advertising consisted of large pageant-style floats of Bao Dai, depicted with bags of money on his shoulders, a deck of cards in his hands and with naked women, which were paraded around Saigon. This was a reference to the Emperor's reputation of opulence, gambling and womanising.<ref name="jacobs">Jacobs, p. 95.</ref> According to [[Joseph Buttinger]], the second in command at the [[International Rescue Committee]], who was based in Vietnam, the methods used to influence the poll were "outrageous." Diem<U+2019>s government controlled press overwhelmed Bao Dai with endless propaganda attacks, with special editions of newspapers being devoted to polemical attacks and biographical accounts of the emperor. Posters and effigies associating Bao Dai with a pig's head were disseminated and police went from door to door explaining the consequences of failing to vote.<ref name="butt"/>

Lansdale also advised Diem to print his ballots in red, while those of Bao Dai were printed in green. In Vietnam, red is associated with good luck and prosperity. Green, on the other hand, is often associated with a [[cuckold]] as well as bad luck.<ref name="karnow"/><ref name="langguth">{{cite book|title=Our Vietnam|first=A. J.|last=Langguth|year=2000|publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]]|pages=99|isbn=0-684-81202-9}}</ref> Diem<U+2019>s red ballots pictured him surrounded by youthful and modern-looking people, while Bao Dai's photo was placed in old fashioned robes, which he never wore, against a green background. The ballot claimed that a vote for Diem would be a vote for democracy, stating "I depose Bao Dai and recognise Ngo Dinh Diem as Head of State, charged with the commission of setting up a democratic regime." Bao Dai's ballot read "I do not depose Bao Dai and do not regard Ngo Dinh Diem as the Head of State charged with the commission of setting up a democratic regime." The use of such methods undermined Diem<U+2019>s future attempts to describe his regime as morally motivated.<ref name="butt"/>

==Voting and aftermath==
On [[October 15]], Bao Dai protested against the holding of the referendum. He went on to ask the governments of [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[India]] and even the [[Soviet Union]] not to recognise Diem, asserting that he was an obstacle to the reunification of Vietnam under the Geneva Accords. On [[October 18]], Bao Dai made the token gesture of dismissing Diem and the following day denounced "the police methods" of Diem<U+2019>s "dictatorship" and warned the Vietnamese populace "against a regime that was bound to lead them to ruin, famine, and war." On [[October 22]], Bao Dai stated "I can even tell you that I know the percentage of favourable votes that Mr. Diem has decided to obtain."<ref name="butt"/>

The elections were held with Diem's brother and confidant [[Ngo Dinh Nhu]], the leader of the family's [[Can Lao]] Party, which supplied Diem's electoral base, organising and supervising the elections. During the election Nhu's staff told voters to throw away the green ballots. Those who disobeyed were often chased down and beaten. [[Pepper sauce]] and [[water]] were sometimes forced into the nostrils of dissenters. The votes were counted without independent supervision. When the final results were announced, Diem recorded 98.2% of the vote, including 605,025 votes in Saigon, where only 450 thousand voters were registered. Diem's tally also exceeded the registration numbers in other districts.<ref name="karnow"/><ref name="jacobs"/>

The scholar [[Bernard Fall]] stated, "there is not the slightest doubt that this plebiscite was only a shade more fraudulent than most electoral tests under a dictatorship." The near unanimous result was replicated in mountainous area and [[Mekong Delta]] swamp areas which were not even under the control of the government and its [[Vietnamese National Army]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Two Viet-Nams|first=Bernard|last=Fall|year=1963|publisher=Praeger publishers|pages=257}}</ref> Overwhelming tallies in excess of 90% for Diem were recorded even in districts of the [[Mekong Delta]], where the [[Hoa Hao]] warlord [[Ba Cut]] and his army had prevented voting.<ref name="butt">{{cite book| title=Vietnam:A Dragon Embattled|first=Joseph|last=Buttinger|year=1967|publisher=[[Praeger publishers]]|pages=890-892}}</ref> 

Three days after the vote, Diem proclaimed the creation of the Republic of Vietnam, with himself as its President.<ref name="langguth"/> The United States celebrated Diem as a new hero of the <U+201C>free world<U+201D>.<ref name="butt"/>
