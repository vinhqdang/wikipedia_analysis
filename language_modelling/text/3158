The '''United States presidential election of 2012''' was the 57th quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]]. It was held on Tuesday, November 6, 2012. The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee, incumbent [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]], and his [[running mate]], [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]], were re-elected to a second term, defeating the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee, former [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Governor]] [[Mitt Romney]], and his running mate, [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Paul Ryan]] of [[Wisconsin]].

As the incumbent president, Obama secured the Democratic nomination with no serious opposition. The Republican Party was more fractured; Mitt Romney was consistently competitive in the polls, but faced challenges from a number of more conservative challengers whose popularity each fluctuated, often besting Romney's. Romney effectively secured the nomination by early May as the economy improved, albeit at a persistently laggard rate. The campaign was marked by a sharp rise in fundraising, including from new nominally independent [[Super PACs]]. The campaigns focused heavily on domestic issues: debate centered largely around sound responses to the [[Great Recession]] in terms of economic recovery and job creation. Other issues included long-term federal budget issues, the future of [[social insurance|social insurance programs]], and the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]]. [[Foreign policy]] was also discussed including the phase-out of the [[Iraq War]], the size of and spending on the military, and appropriate counteractions to terrorism.

Obama won both the popular vote and the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral college]] with 332 electoral votes to Romney's 206. He became the eleventh President and third Democrat to win a majority of the popular vote more than once. Obama carried all states and districts (among states that allocate electoral votes by district) that he had won in [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]] except [[United States presidential election in North Carolina, 2012|North Carolina]], [[United States presidential election in Indiana, 2012|Indiana]], and [[United States presidential election in Nebraska, 2012|Nebraska's 2nd congressional district]].

Eight states (Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, and Washington) gained votes due to reapportionment based on the 2010 Census. Ten states (Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania) lost votes. This gave the Democratic Party a net loss of six electoral votes in states won by Democratic nominees in the previous three presidential elections, rendering the party a national total of 242 electoral votes. Conversely, the Republican Party achieved a net gain of six electoral votes in states won by Republican nominees in the previous three presidential elections, rendering the Republican Party a national total of 180 electoral votes.

==State changes to voter registration and electoral rules==
In 2011, several state legislatures passed new voting laws, especially pertaining to voter identification, with the stated purpose of combating [[voter fraud]]; the laws were attacked, however, by the Democratic Party as attempts to suppress voting among its supporters and to improve the Republican Party's presidential prospects. Florida, Georgia, Ohio,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-callahan/ohios-voter-id-law-and-th_b_840399.html |title=David Callahan: Ohio's Voter ID Law and the 2012 Election |work= Huffington Post Politics blog |accessdate=October 20, 2011 |date=March 25, 2011}}</ref> Tennessee, and West Virginia's state legislatures approved measures to shorten early voting periods.

In addition, the [[Pennsylvania]] legislature proposed a plan to change its representation in the electoral college from the traditional winner-take-all model to a district-by-district model.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://theweek.com/article/index/219241/pennsylvanias-democrat-screwing-2012-genius-plan |title=Pennsylvania's 'Democrat-screwing' 2012 'genius plan' |newspaper=The Week |location =New York |date=September 15, 2011 |accessdate=October 20, 2011}}</ref> As the governorship and both houses of its legislature were Republican-controlled, the move was viewed by some as an attempt to reduce Democratic chances.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11256/1174283-454.stm |title=Change proposed for state's electoral vote process |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=September 13, 2011 |accessdate=October 20, 2011 |first=Laura |last=Olson}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Rosenbaum |first=Ron |url= http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2011/09/13/pennsylvania_ponders_bold_democrat_screwing_electoral_plan.html |title=Pennsylvania Ponders Bold Democrat-Screwing Electoral Plan |work=Slate.com |date=September 13, 2011 |accessdate=October 20, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/sep/15/pennsylvania-gop-looks-split-electoral-votes/?page=1 |title=Pennsylvania GOP looks to split electoral votes |work=The Washington Times |date=September 15, 2011 |accessdate=October 20, 2011}}</ref>

==Nominations==

===Democratic Party===
{{main|Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2012|2012 Democratic National Convention}}

====Primaries====
With an incumbent president running for re-election against token opposition, the race for the Democratic nomination was largely uneventful. The nomination process consisted of [[United States presidential primary|primaries and caucuses]], held by the 50 states, as well as [[Guam]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], [[American Samoa]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]. Additionally, high-ranking party members known as [[superdelegate]]s each received one vote in the convention. A few of the primary challengers surpassed the president's vote total in individual counties in several of the seven contested primaries, though none made a significant impact in the delegate count. Running unopposed everywhere else, President Obama cemented his status as the Democratic [[presumptive nominee]] on April 3, 2012 by securing the minimum number of pledged delegates needed to clinch the nomination.<ref>Jackson, David (April 4, 2012)[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2012/04/this-just-in-obama-clinches-democratic-nomination/1#.T4R3afJmnj5 "It's official: Obama clinches Democratic nomination"], ''[[USA Today]]''.

===Republican Party===
{{Main|Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012|Prelude to the Republican presidential primaries, 2012|Republican Party presidential debates, 2012|2012 Republican National Convention}}

====Primaries====
Candidates with considerable name recognition who entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination in the early stages of the primary campaign included [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] and former Libertarian nominee [[Ron Paul]], former Governor [[Tim Pawlenty]], who co-chaired [[John McCain]]'s campaign in 2008, former Governor [[Mitt Romney]], the runner-up for the nomination in the 2008 cycle, and former [[Speaker of the House]] [[Newt Gingrich]].

The first debate took place on May 5, 2011 in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], with businessman [[Herman Cain]], former New Mexico Governor [[Gary Johnson]], [[Ron Paul]], [[Tim Pawlenty]], and former Pennsylvania Senator [[Rick Santorum]] participating. Another debate took place a month later, with [[Newt Gingrich]], [[Mitt Romney]], former Utah Governor [[Jon Huntsman, Jr.|Jon Huntsman]], and Rep. [[Michele Bachmann]] participating, and Gary Johnson excluded. A total of thirteen debates were held before the Iowa caucuses.

The first major event of the campaign was the [[Ames Straw Poll]], which took place in Iowa on August 13, 2011. Michele Bachmann won the straw poll (this ultimately proved to be the acme of her campaign).<ref>{{Cite news |last=Goldman |first=Russell |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/01/bachmann-drops-out-of-presidential-race/ |title=Michele Bachmann Drops Out of Presidential Race |publisher=ABC News |date=July 5, 2012}}</ref> Pawlenty withdrew from the race after a poor showing in the straw poll, as did [[Thaddeus McCotter]], the only candidate among those who qualified for the ballot who was refused entrance into the debate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0811/61098.html|title=Barred hopefuls make debate plans |last=Summers |first=Juana |date=August 11, 2011 |work=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]] |accessdate=July 5, 2012}}</ref>

It became clear at around this point in the nomination process that while Romney was considered to be the likely nominee by the Republican establishment, a large segment of the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] primary electorate found him to be too [[moderate]] for their tastes. As a result, a number of potential "anti-Romney" candidates were put forward,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/01/09/us-campaign-romney-idINDEE80804P20120109|title=Romney's rivals running out of time to stop him|first=Tim|last=Reid|date=January 9, 2012|work=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=July 5, 2012}}</ref><ref>Norington, Brad [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/romney-has-money-but-lacks-conviction/story-e6frg6ux-1226285540352 "Romney has money but lacks conviction"], ''[[The Australian]]''.

Santorum, who had previously run an essentially one-state campaign in Iowa, was able to organize a national campaign after his surprising victory in Iowa.

Santorum won Kansas and three Southern primaries, but he was unable to make any substantial gain on Romney, who became a formidable frontrunner after securing more than half of the delegates allocated in March.

On April 10, Santorum suspended his campaign due to a variety of reasons, such as a low delegate count, unfavorable polls in his home state of Pennsylvania, and his daughter's health, leaving Mitt Romney as the undisputed front-runner for the presidential nomination and allowing Gingrich to claim that he was "the last conservative standing" in the campaign for the nomination.<ref>Gabriel, Trip (April 10, 2012) [http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/10/gingrich-says-hes-in-the-race-to-the-end/# "Gingrich Says He's in the Race to the End"], ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> After disappointing results in the April 24 primaries (finishing second in one state, third in three, and fourth in one<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_presidential_primaries,_2012#April Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia].

On May 29, after winning the Texas primary, Romney had received a sufficient number of delegates to clinch the party's nomination with the inclusion of unpledged delegates.  After winning the June 5 primaries in California and several other states, Romney had received more than enough pledged delegates to clinch the nomination without counting unpledged delegates, making the June 26 Utah Primary, the last contest of the cycle, purely symbolic. CNN's final delegate estimate, released on July 27, 2012, put Romney at 1,462 pledged delegates and 62 unpledged delegates, for a total estimate of 1,524 delegates. No other candidate had unpledged delegates.

The Presidential Nomination of the Green Party was primarily fought for by two of its candidates, [[Jill Stein]] who was Chair of the [[Green-Rainbow Party]] in [[Massachusetts]], and [[Roseanne Barr]] a noted Comedian. While Barr unexpectedly proved to be a formidable opponent for Stein, her campaign was fatally injured when she lost the party's California presidential primary. While Stein managed to comfortably carry the nomination at Baltimore, Barr sought and later attained the [[Peace and Freedom Party|Peace and Freedom Party's]] nomination. [[Cheri Honkala]], and anti-poverty advocate from [[Pennsylvania]], was nominated to be Stein's running-mate. Stein and Honkala received 469,583 votes ''(0.36% of the National Popular vote)''.

Initially there was little challenge against [[Virgil Goode]], who had only declared his intention to run for the nomination in February. At the Party's convention in Nashville however [[Darrell Castle]], who had been the party's nominee for the Vice Presidency in 2008, decided to run himself at the urging of a number of the delegates present, despite his prior promises to both Goode and [[Robby Wells]] that he had no intention of seeking the nomination. Virgil Goode managed to attain the nomination on the first ballot, just barely attaining a majority of the vote. [[Jim Clymer]], who up to that time was the Chairman of the Constitution Party, was named his running mate. Goode and Clymer received 122,001 votes ''(0.09% of the National Popular vote)''.

===Notable expressions, phrases, and statements===
<!--

-->
* Severely conservative <U+2013> In a speech he made at the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] in February 2012, Romney claimed that he had been a "severely conservative Republican governor." Romney's description of his record as "severely conservative" was widely criticized by political commentators as both rhetorically clumsy and factually inaccurate.<ref>Fahrenthold, David A.. (2012-02-16) [http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-02-16/politics/35444438_1_mitt-romney-conservative-governor-david-tuerck Mitt Romney reframes himself as a 'severely conservative' governor - Washington Post]. Articles.washingtonpost.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-12.</ref><ref>[http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/mitt-romneys-severe-conservatism_652663.html Mitt Romney's 'Severe Conservatism']. The Weekly Standard (2012-09-18). Retrieved on 2013-08-12.</ref><ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/13/opinion/frum-romney-moves/index.html Mitt Romney's 'severely' bad moves]. CNN.com (2012-02-13). Retrieved on 2013-08-12.</ref> Later, the phrase "severely conservative" was frequently brought up by Democrats to make fun of Romney's willingness to associate himself with the far-right of the Republican Party as well as his apparent lack of sincerity while doing so.
* [[You didn't build that]] <U+2013> A portion of a statement that Obama made in a July 2012 campaign speech in [[Roanoke, Virginia]]. Obama was explaining how businesses depend on government-provided infrastructure to succeed, but many critics of his remarks claimed that he was underplaying the work of entrepreneurs and giving the government credit for individuals' success. The Romney campaign immediately jumped on the statement in an effort to drive a wedge between Obama and small business owners. A major theme of the [[2012 Republican National Convention]] was "We Built It."
* [[47 percent]] <U+2013> An expression Romney used at a private campaign fundraising event, which was secretly recorded and publicly released. At the private event, Romney said that 47 percent of the people would vote for Barack Obama no matter what Romney said or did because those people "...are dependent upon government."
* [[Binders full of women]] <U+2013> A phrase that Romney used in the [[Second U.S. presidential debate of 2012|second presidential debate]] to refer to the long list of female candidates that he considered when choosing his cabinet members as Governor of Massachusetts.
* Romnesia <U+2013> A term coined by a blogger in April 2011 and used by Obama late in the campaign to describe Romney's alleged inability to take responsibility for his past statements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.hcfama.org/2011/04/04/romnesia/|title=Romnesia|work=hcfama.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Kantrowitz, Alex |url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkantrowitz/2012/10/21/romnesia-a-made-for-social-media-attack-line/ |title=#Romnesia: A Made for Social Media Attack Line |publisher=Forbes |date=October 21, 2012 |accessdate=October 22, 2012}}</ref>

===Romney's concession===
[[File:Obama takes Romney concession call.jpg|thumb|upright|Obama takes a phone call from Romney conceding the election early Wednesday morning in Chicago.]]

After the networks called Ohio (the state that was arguably the most critical for Romney, as no Republican had ever won the election without carrying it) for Obama at around 11:15 PM [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]] on Election Day, Romney was at first reluctant to concede the race, as many counties in Ohio were still outstanding. However, after Colorado and Nevada were called for the President (giving Obama enough electoral votes to win even if Ohio were to leave his column), in tandem with Obama's apparent lead in Florida and Virginia (both were eventually called for Obama), Romney acknowledged that he had lost and conceded at around 1:00 AM [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]] on November 7.

Despite public polling showing Romney behind Obama in the swing states of Nevada, Colorado, Iowa, Wisconsin, Ohio, and New Hampshire, tied with Obama in Virginia, and just barely ahead of Obama in Florida, the Romney campaign said they were genuinely surprised by the loss, having believed that public polling was oversampling Democrats.<ref name=Adviser:>{{cite news |title=Adviser: Romney "shellshocked" by loss |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57547239/adviser-romney-shellshocked-by-loss/?pageNum=1&tag=page |accessdate=November 10, 2012 |website=CBS News |date=November 8, 2012}}</ref> The Romney campaign had already set up a transition website, and had scheduled and purchased a fireworks display to celebrate in case he won the election.<ref>{{cite news |title=Romney's Transition Site |url=http://politicalwire.com/archives/2012/11/07/romneys_transition_site.html |accessdate=November 30, 2012 |newspaper=Political Wire |date=November 7, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Romney campaign spent $25,000 on fireworks">{{cite news |title=Romney campaign spent $25,000 on fireworks |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2012/11/09/romney-campaign-spent-fireworks/YrFOs5OEgE98XvjBJ9nItJ/story.html |accessdate=November 10, 2012 |newspaper=Boston Globe |date=November 9, 2012}}</ref>

===Reactions===
{{further|International reactions to the United States presidential election, 2012}}
Foreign leaders reacted with both positive and mixed messages. Most world leaders congratulated and praised Barack Obama on his re-election victory. However, Venezuela and some other states had tempered reactions. Pakistan commented that Romney's defeat had made [[Pakistan-United States relations]] safer. Stock markets fell noticeably after Obama's re-election, with the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]], [[NASDAQ]], and the [[S&P 500]] each declining over two percent the day after the election.<ref name=WSJ-DOW>{{cite news |last=Cheng |first=Jonathan |title=Dow's 300-Point Slide Takes It Back to August Levels |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323894704578104153584769278.html?mod=wsj_streaming_markets |accessdate=November 7, 2012 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=November 7, 2012}}</ref> The main reason given for the sharp drop was the potential of an unresolved "fiscal cliff" due to the continued split control of the House, the Senate, and the White House.

==Analysis==
Combined with the re-elections of [[Bill Clinton]] and [[George W. Bush]], Obama's victory in the 2012 election marked only the second time in American history that three consecutive presidents were each elected to two or more full terms (the first time being the consecutive two-term presidencies of [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]], and [[James Monroe]]).<ref name=cnbc110712>{{cite news|last=Hum|first=Robert|title=Two-Term Presidency Musings|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/49722770/TwoTerm_Presidency_Musings|accessdate=February 12, 2013|publisher=CNBC|date=November 7, 2012}}</ref> This was also the first election since [[United States presidential election, 1944|1944]] in which neither of the major candidates had any military experience.

The 2012 election marked the first time since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s last two re-elections in [[United States presidential election, 1940|1940]] and [[United States presidential election, 1944|1944]] that a Democratic presidential candidate won a majority of the popular vote in two consecutive elections.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.thenation.com/blog/171178/obama-has-great-big-mandate-and-he-must-use-it# |title= Obama's 3 Million Vote, Electoral College Landslide, Majority of States Mandate |last=Nichols |first=John |date=November 9, 2012 |work=The Nation |location= New York |accessdate= November 18, 2012}}</ref> Obama was also the first president of either party to secure at least 51% of the popular vote in two elections since [[Dwight Eisenhower]] in 1952 and 1956.<ref name=bloom010413>{{cite news |last= Giroux |first=Greg |title=Final Tally Shows Obama First Since '56 to Win 51% Twice |url= http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-03/final-tally-shows-obama-first-since-56-to-win-51-twice.html |accessdate=February 12, 2013 |newspaper=Bloomberg |date=January 4, 2013}}</ref> Overall, Obama is the third Democratic president to secure at least 51% of the vote twice, after [[Andrew Jackson]] and Franklin D. Roosevelt.
