==Replication cycle==
[[Image:Poliovirus life cycle.png|thumb|300px|right| The replication cycle of poliovirus is initiated (1) by binding to the cell surface receptor CD155. The virion is taken up via endocytosis, and the viral RNA is released (2). Translation of the viral RNA occurs by an IRES-mediated mechanism (3). The polyprotein is cleaved, yielding mature viral proteins (4). The positive-sense RNA serves as template for complementary negative-strand synthesis, producing double-stranded replicative form (RF) RNA(5). Many positive strand RNA copies are produced from the single negative strand (6). The newly synthesized positive-sense RNA molecules can serve as templates for translation of more viral proteins (7) or can be enclosed in a capsid (8), which ultimately generates progeny virions. Lysis of the infected cell results in release of infectious progeny virions (9).<ref name=DeJesus>{{cite journal |author=De Jesus NH |title=Epidemics to eradication: the modern history of poliomyelitis | url= http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/70 |journal=Virol.

Poliovirus is a positive stranded [[RNA virus]]. Thus the genome enclosed within the viral particle can be used as [[messenger RNA]] and immediately [[translation (biology)|translated]] by the host cell. On entry the virus hijacks the cell's translation machinery; causing inhibition of cellular protein synthesis in favor of virus<U+2013>specific protein production. Unlike the host cell's mRNAs the [[directionality (molecular biology)|5'&nbsp;end]] of poliovirus RNA is extremely long<U+2014>over 700 nucleotides<U+2014>and is highly structured. This region of the viral genome is called [[internal ribosome entry site]] (IRES) and it directs translation of the viral RNA.

==Origin and serotypes==
Poliovirus is structurally similar to other human enteroviruses ([[coxsackievirus]]es, [[echovirus]]es, and [[rhinovirus]]es), which also use immunoglobulin-like molecules to recognize and enter host cells.<ref name=He/> [[Phylogenetic]] analysis of the RNA and protein sequences of poliovirus (PV) suggests that PV may have evolved from a C-cluster [[Coxsackie A virus]] [[common descent|ancestor]], that arose through a mutation within the capsid.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jiang P, Faase JA, Toyoda H, ''et al.'' |title=Evidence for emergence of diverse polioviruses from C-cluster Coxsackie A viruses and implications for global poliovirus eradication |journal=Proc.

There are three [[serotype]]s of poliovirus, ''PV1'', ''PV2'', and ''PV3''; each with a slightly different [[capsid]] protein. Capsid proteins define cellular receptor specificity and virus antigenicity. ''PV1'' is the most common form encountered in nature, however all three forms are extremely [[infectious disease|infectious]].<ref name=Paul_1971/> Wild polioviruses can be found in two continents. As of 2012, PV1 is highly localized to regions in Pakistan and Afghanistan in Asia, and Nigeria, Niger and Chad in Africa. Wild poliovirus type 2 has probably been eradicated; it was last detected in October 1999 in [[Uttar Pradesh]], India.<ref name=pmid11315462>{{cite journal |author= |title=Transmission of wild poliovirus type 2<U+2014>apparent global interruption |journal=Wkly.

Specific strains of each serotype are used to prepare [[polio vaccine|vaccines against polio]]. Inactive polio vaccine (IPV) is prepared by [[formaldehyde|formalin]] inactivation of three wild, virulent reference strains, Mahoney or Brunenders (PV1), MEF-1/Lansing (PV2), and Saukett/Leon (PV3). Oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains [[attenuated vaccine|live attenuated]] (weakened) strains of the three serotypes of poliovirus. [[Passaging]] the virus strains in monkey kidney epithelial cells introduces mutations in the viral IRES, and hinders (or attenuates) the ability of the virus to infect nervous tissue.<ref name=Kew_2005/>

Polioviruses were formerly classified as a distinct species belonging to the genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae. In 2008 the Poliovirus species was eliminated from the genus Enterovirus and the three serotypes were assigned to the species Human enterovirus C (later renamed to Enterovirus C), in the genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae. The type species of the genus Enterovirus was changed from Poliovirus to (Human) Enterovirus C.<ref>{{Cite journal

==Pathogenesis==
{{main|Poliomyelitis}}
[[Image:Polio EM PHIL 1875 lores.PNG|thumb|[[Electron micrograph]] of poliovirus.]]

The primary determinant of infection for any virus is its ability to enter a cell and produce additional infectious particles. The presence of CD155 is thought to define the animals and tissues that can be infected by poliovirus. CD155 is found (outside of laboratories) only on the cells of humans, higher [[primates]], and [[Old World monkey]]s. Poliovirus is however strictly a human pathogen, and does not naturally infect any other species (although [[chimpanzee]]s and Old World monkeys can be experimentally infected).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mueller S, Wimmer E |title=Recruitment of nectin-3 to cell-cell junctions through trans-heterophilic interaction with CD155, a vitronectin and poliovirus receptor that localizes to alpha(v)beta3 integrin-containing membrane microdomains | url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/278/33/31251| journal=J Biol Chem |volume=278 |issue=33 |pages=31251<U+2013>60 |year=2003 |pmid=12759359 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M304166200}}</ref>

Within this domain 37 amino acids are responsible for binding the virus.

Poliovirus is an [[enterovirus]]. Infection occurs via the [[fecal<U+2013>oral route]], meaning that one ingests the virus and viral replication occurs in the [[alimentary tract]].<ref name=Bodian_1965>{{cite book |author = Bodian D and Horstmann DH |title=Polioviruse |publisher=Lippincott |location=Philadelphia, Penn |year=1969 |pages=430<U+2013>73}}</ref> Virus is shed in the feces of infected individuals. In 95% of cases only a primary, transient presence of [[viremia]] (virus in the bloodstream) occurs, and the poliovirus infection is [[asymptomatic]]. In about 5% of cases, the virus spreads and replicates in other sites such as [[brown fat]], [[reticuloendothelial]] tissue, and [[muscle]]. The sustained viral replication causes secondary viremia and leads to the development of minor symptoms such as fever, headache and sore throat.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sabin A |title=Pathogenesis of poliomyelitis; reappraisal in the light of new data |journal=Science |volume=123 |issue=3209 |pages=1151<U+2013>7 |year=1956 |pmid=13337331 |doi=10.1126/science.123.3209.1151}}</ref> Paralytic poliomyelitis occurs in less than 1% of poliovirus infections. Paralytic disease occurs when the virus enters the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) and replicates in [[motor neuron]]s within the [[spinal cord]], [[brain stem]], or [[motor cortex]], resulting in the selective destruction of motor neurons leading to temporary or permanent [[paralysis]]. In rare cases, paralytic poliomyelitis leads to [[respiratory arrest]] and death. In cases of paralytic disease, muscle pain and spasms are frequently observed prior to onset of weakness and paralysis. Paralysis typically persists anywhere from days to weeks prior to recovery.<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/306440-overview</ref><ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/967950-overview</ref>

In many respects the [[neurological]] phase of infection is thought to be an accidental diversion of the normal [[gastrointestinal]] infection.<ref name=Mueller/> The mechanisms by which poliovirus enters the CNS are poorly understood. Three non-mutually exclusive hypotheses have been suggested to explain its entry. All theories require primary viremia. The first hypothesis predicts that virions pass directly from the [[blood]] into the central nervous system by crossing the [[blood<U+2013>brain barrier]] independent of CD155.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yang W, Terasaki T, Shiroki K, ''et al.''|title=Efficient delivery of circulating poliovirus to the central nervous system independently of poliovirus receptor |journal=Virology |volume=229 |issue=2 |pages=421<U+2013>8 |year=1997 |pmid=9126254 |doi=10.1006/viro.1997.8450}}</ref> A second hypothesis suggests that the virions are transported from peripheral tissues that have been bathed in the viremic blood, for example muscle tissue, to the spinal cord through nerve pathways via [[axoplasmic_transport#Retrograde_transport|retrograde axonal transport]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ohka S.

Poliomyelitis is a disease of the central nervous system. However, CD155 is believed to be present on the surface of most or all human cells. Therefore receptor expression does not explain why poliovirus preferentially infects certain tissues. This suggests that tissue [[tropism]] is determined after cellular infection. Recent work has suggested that the [[interferon type I|type I interferon]] response (specifically that of interferon alpha and beta) is an important factor that defines which types of cells support poliovirus replication.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ida-Hosonuma M, Iwasaki T, Yoshikawa T, ''et al.'' |title=The alpha/beta interferon response controls tissue tropism and pathogenicity of poliovirus |journal=J.

==Immune system avoidance==

Poliovirus uses two key mechanisms to evade the [[immune system]]. First, it is capable of surviving the highly [[pH|acidic]] conditions of the [[gastrointestinal tract]], allowing the virus to infect the host and spread throughout the body via the [[lymphatic system]].<ref name= Goodsell/> Second, because it can replicate very quickly, the virus overwhelms the host organs before an immune response can be mounted.<ref name= Racaniello>{{cite journal |author=Racaniello V |title=One hundred years of poliovirus pathogenesis |journal=Virology |volume=344 |issue=1 |pages=9<U+2013>16 |year=2006 |pmid=16364730 |doi=10.1016/j.virol.2005.09.015}}</ref>

Individuals who are exposed to poliovirus, either through infection or by [[immunization]] with [[polio vaccine]], develop [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]. In immune individuals, [[antibodies]] against poliovirus are present in the [[tonsil]]s and gastrointestinal tract (specifically [[IgA]] antibodies) and are able to block poliovirus replication; [[IgG]] and [[IgM]] antibodies against poliovirus can prevent the spread of the virus to motor neurons of the central nervous system.<ref name=Kew_2005/> Infection with one serotype of poliovirus does not provide immunity against the other serotypes, however second attacks within the same individual are extremely rare.

==PVR transgenic mouse==

Although humans are the only known natural hosts of poliovirus, monkeys can be experimentally infected and they have long been used to study poliovirus. In 1990<U+2013>91, a small animal model of poliomyelitis was developed by two laboratories. Mice were [[genetic engineering|engineered]] to express a human receptor to poliovirus (hPVR).<ref name=pmid2170026>{{cite journal |author=Ren RB, Costantini F, Gorgacz EJ, Lee JJ, Racaniello VR |title=Transgenic mice expressing a human poliovirus receptor: a new model for poliomyelitis |journal=Cell |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=353<U+2013>62 |year=1990 |pmid=2170026|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(90)90168-E}}</ref><ref name=pmid1846972>{{cite journal |author=Koike S, Taya C, Kurata T, ''et al.'' |title=Transgenic mice susceptible to poliovirus |journal=Proc.

Unlike normal mice, [[transgenic]] poliovirus receptor (TgPVR) mice are susceptible to poliovirus injected [[intravenously]] or [[intramuscularly]], and when injected directly into the [[spinal cord]] or the [[brain]].<ref name=pmid8289371>{{cite journal |author=Horie H, Koike S, Kurata T, ''et al.'' |title=Transgenic mice carrying the human poliovirus receptor: new animal models for study of poliovirus neurovirulence |journal=J.

This mouse model of human poliovirus infection has proven to be an invaluable tool in understanding poliovirus biology and pathogenicity.<ref name="pmid11597452">{{cite journal |author=Ohka S, Nomoto A |title=Recent insights into poliovirus pathogenesis |journal=Trends Microbiol. |volume=9 |issue=10 |pages=501<U+2013>6 |year=2001 |pmid=11597452 |doi=10.1016/S0966-842X(01)02200-4}}</ref>

Three distinct types of TgPVR mice have been well studied:<ref name=pmid7832641>{{cite journal |author=Koike S, Taya C, Aoki J, ''et al.'' |title=Characterization of three different transgenic mouse lines that carry human poliovirus receptor gene--influence of the transgene expression on pathogenesis |journal=Arch. Virol. |volume=139 |issue=3<U+2013>4 |pages=351<U+2013>63 |year=1994 |pmid=7832641|doi=10.1007/BF01310797}}</ref>

*In TgPVR1 mice the transgene encoding the human PVR was incorporated into mouse [[chromosome]] 4. These mice express the highest levels of the transgene and the highest sensitivity to poliovirus. TgPVR1 mice are susceptible to poliovirus through the intraspinal, intracerebral, intramuscular, and intravenous pathways, but not through the oral route.
*TgPVR21 mice have incorporated the human PVR at chromosome 13. These mice are less susceptible to poliovirus infection through the intracerebral route, possibly because they express decreased levels of hPVR. TgPVR21 mice have been shown to be susceptible to poliovirus infection through intranasal inoculation, and may be useful as a [[mucosa]]l infection model.<ref name=pmid15033568>{{cite journal |author=Nagata N, Iwasaki T, Ami Y, ''et al.'' |title=A poliomyelitis model through mucosal infection in transgenic mice bearing human poliovirus receptor, TgPVR21 |journal=Virology |volume=321 |issue=1 |pages=87<U+2013>100 |year=2004 |pmid=15033568 |doi=10.1016/j.virol.2003.12.008}}</ref>
*In TgPVR5 mice the human transgene is located on chromosome 12. These mice exhibit the lowest levels of hPVR expression and are the least susceptible to poliovirus infection.

Recently a fourth TgPVR mouse model was developed. These "cPVR" mice carry hPVR [[cDNA]], driven by a <U+03B2>-[[actin]] [[promoter (biology)|promoter]], and have proven susceptible to poliovirus through intracerebral, intramuscular, and intranasal routes. In addition, these mice are capable of developing the [[poliomyelitis#Bulbar polio|bulbar form of polio]] after intranasal inoculation.<ref name="pmid15033568"/>

The development of the TgPVR mouse has had a profound effect on oral [[poliovirus vaccine]] (OPV) production. Previously, monitoring the safety of OPV had to be performed using monkeys, because only primates are susceptible to the virus. In 1999 the [[World Health Organization]] approved the use of the TgPVR mouse as an alternative method of assessing the effectiveness of the vaccine against poliovirus type-3. In 2000 the mouse model was approved for tests of vaccines against type-1 and type-2 poliovirus.<ref name=pmid12764491>{{cite journal |doi=10.1590/S0042-96862003000400006 |author=Dragunsky E, Nomura T, Karpinski K, ''et al.'' |title=Transgenic mice as an alternative to monkeys for neurovirulence testing of live oral poliovirus vaccine: validation by a WHO collaborative study |url= http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0042-96862003000400006&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en |journal=Bull.

==Cloning and synthesis==
[[File:Poliovirus binding receptor 1DGI.png|thumb|left|Model of poliovirus binding CD155 (shown in purple)]]
In 1981 Racaniello and Baltimore used recombinant DNA technology to generate the first infectious [[molecular cloning|clone]] of an animal RNA virus, poliovirus. DNA encoding the RNA genome of poliovirus was introduced into cultured mammalian cells and infectious poliovirus was produced.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Racaniello V, Baltimore D |title=Cloned poliovirus complemenatry DNA is infectious in mammalian cells |journal=Science |volume=214 |issue=453 |pages=916<U+2013>9 |year=1981 |pmid=6272391 |doi=10.1126/science.6272391}}</ref> Creation of the infectious clone propelled understanding of poliovirus biology, and has become a standard technology used to study many other viruses.

In 2002 [[Eckard Wimmer]]'s group at [[SUNY Stony Brook]] succeeded in synthesizing poliovirus from its chemical code, producing the world's first synthetic virus.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cello J, Paul AV, Wimmer E |title=Chemical synthesis of poliovirus cDNA: generation of infectious virus in the absence of natural template |journal=Science |volume=297 |issue=5583 |pages=1016<U+2013>8 |year=2002 |pmid=12114528 |doi=10.1126/science.1072266}}</ref> Scientists first converted poliovirus's published RNA sequence, 7741 bases long, into a DNA sequence, as DNA was easier to synthesize. Short fragments of this DNA sequence were obtained by mail-order, and assembled. The complete viral genome was then assembled by a [[gene synthesis]] company. This whole painstaking process took two years. Nineteen [[marker gene|markers]] were incorporated into the synthesized DNA, so that it could be distinguished from natural poliovirus. [[Enzyme]]s were used to convert the DNA back into RNA, its natural state. Other enzymes were then used to translate the RNA into a polypeptide, producing functional viral particle. The newly minted synthetic virus was injected into PVR transgenic mice, to determine if the synthetic version was able to cause disease. The synthetic virus was able to replicate, infect, and cause paralysis or death in mice. However, the synthetic version was between 1,000 and 10,000 times less lethal than the original virus.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Couzin J |title=Virology.
