'''Blair Anderson Wark''' [[Victoria Cross|VC]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] (27 July 1894 &ndash; 13 June 1941) was an Australian recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest award for gallantry "in the face of the enemy" that can be awarded to members of the British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armed forces. A [[quantity surveyor]] and member of the Citizens Military Force, Wark enlisted in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] on 5 August 1915, for service in the [[First World War]]. After initially being employed in the defence of the [[Suez Canal]], his battalion was shipped to the Western Front; it was here that Wark would be twice decorated for his bravery and leadership. Having received the [[Distinguished Service Order]] in 1917 for his actions at [[Polygon Wood]], Wark was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1918 for his leadership and gallantry when in temporary command of his battalion over a three-day period, while conducting operations against the [[Hindenburg Line]].

Returning to Australia after the war, Wark resumed work as a quantity surveyor and established his own business. A respected member of Australian society, he held several positions and directorships in various companies and charities, before re-enlisting for service in the [[Second World War]]. Promoted to [[lieutenant colonel]], Wark assumed command of the 1st Battalion (City of Sydney's Own Regiment), but died suddenly at Puckapunyal Camp, Victoria, of [[coronary heart disease]] at the age of 46.

==Early life==
Wark was born in [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], [[New South Wales]] on 27 July 1894, the fourth child of Alexander Wark, a gas engineer from [[Scotland]], and his native-born wife Blanche Adelaide Maria, n<U+00E9>e Forde. He was educated at Fairleigh Grammar School, Bathurst, and [[North Sydney Boys High School|St Leonard's Superior Public School]] before attending [[Sydney Technical College]],<ref name="ADB">{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Gorrell|first=Richard|year=1990|id=A120433b|title=Wark, Blair Anderson (1894 - 1941)|accessdate=26 August 2008}}</ref> where he studied quantity surveying.<ref name="AF"/>

In the twelve months prior to July 1912, Wark was a senior cadet in the [[Australian Army Cadets]], rising to the rank of [[sergeant]] within his unit. During this time, he was working as a quantity surveyor before he enlisted in the 18th North Sydney Infantry, [[Australian Army Reserve|Citizen Military Force]]. Promoted to [[corporal]] in early 1913, he received a commission as a [[second lieutenant]] on 16 August,<ref name="AF">{{Harvnb|Staunton|2005|p=187}}</ref> and for the subsequent year was assigned to full-time defence duties in the port of Sydney.<ref name="VCs60">{{Harvnb|Gliddon|2000|p=60}}</ref>

==First World War==
===Enlistment, August 1915 to Western Front, September 1918===
On 5 August 1915, Wark enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force,<ref name="AF"/> and was posted as a [[lieutenant]] to C Company of the newly raised 30th Battalion.<ref name="ER">{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm8/23_47_1/pdf/0271.pdf|title=Blair Anderson Wark|accessdaymonth=26 August|accessyear=2008|format=PDF|work=First World War Embarkation Roll|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}</ref> He proceeded to [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]], where he attended an infantry school before training at the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]].<ref name="VCs60"/> On 9 November, the 30th Battalion embarked for Egypt aboard the troopship HMAT A72 ''Beltana''.<ref name="ER"/> Upon arrival in December,<ref name="AIF">{{cite web|url=http://www.aif.adfa.edu.au:8080/showPerson?key=WARK/BA/|title=Blair Anderson WARK|accessdaymonth=26 August|accessyear=2008|work=AIF Project|publisher=Australian Defence Force Academy}}</ref> the battalion was tasked with the defence of the Suez Canal where, on 20 February 1916, Wark was promoted to [[Captain (land)|captain]].<ref name="AF"/>

In June, the battalion departed from [[Alexandria]] to join the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] in France for service on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]; they arrived at [[Marseilles]] on 23 June.<ref name="AIF"/> The 30th Battalion's first major action began with the outbreak of the [[Battle of Fromelles]] on 19 July 1916. The unit was originally designated with providing carrying parties for supplies and ammunition during the battle, but was subsequently pulled into the fighting.<ref name="30th">{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11217.asp|title=30th Battalion|work=Australian military units|accessdaymonth=26 August|accessyear=2008|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}</ref> Wark commanded a company during the action,<ref name="ADB"/> until being evacuated to the 7th Stationary Hospital with a gunshot wound to his leg. He was transferred to the 3rd London General Hospital in England three days later, and moved again to the 5th Australian Auxiliary Hospital, Digswell House, [[Welwyn]], on 7 August. Recovered by September, Wark was discharged and granted leave before returning to France and the 30th Battalion later that month.<ref name="AIF"/>

On 9 October 1916, Wark was attached to the 32nd Battalion, a position that became permanent on 18 November.<ref name="AIF"/> The 32nd Battalion saw no major offensive action for the remainder of the year,<ref name="32nd">{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11219.asp|title=32nd Battalion|work=Australian military units|accessdaymonth=26 August|accessyear=2008|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}</ref> and on 2 January 1917, Wark gained admission to the Army Infantry School. By February he was back with the 32nd Battalion, and took part in actions at Sunray Trench during March. For these, and further actions at Fromelles, Wark was recommended for the Distinguished Service Order,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm28/1/267/0024.pdf|title=Recommendation for Blair Anderson Wark to be awarded a Distinguished Service Order (1916)|work=Recommendations: First World War|accessdaymonth=26 August|accessyear=2008|format=PDF|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}</ref> but the award was never made.<ref name="ADB"/> He was promoted to [[major]] on 27 April, and in June was granted six days of leave to [[Paris, France|Paris]].<ref name="AIF"/>

In late September and early October, Wark commanded a company in the [[Ypres]] sector of Belgium during the [[Battle of Polygon Wood]].<ref name="VCs60"/> On 29 September&mdash;the first day of the battle&mdash;Wark's men successfully repelled the leading waves of a German counter-attack and, with artillery support, drove off the remainder. Over the following three days, his constant patrolling and personal reconnaissance of the German positions enabled him to ascertain when they were massing for further counter-attacks; on one occasion he dispersed the assembling German troops with rifle fire and grenades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm28/1/282/0004.pdf|title=Recommendation for Blair Anderson Wark to be awarded a Distinguished Service Order (1918)|work=Recommendations: First World War|accessdaymonth=26 August|accessyear=2008|format=PDF|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}</ref> For his actions during the battle, Wark was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, the details of which were published in a supplement to the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 3 June 1918.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=30716|date=3 June 1918|startpage=6461|supp=yes|accessdaymonth=26 August|accessyear=2008}}</ref>

Granted sixteen days leave to the United Kingdom from 3 November, Wark was selected for a senior officers' course at [[Aldershot, England]], in January 1918.<ref name="AIF"/> On graduation he rejoined the 32nd Battalion in March as its second-in-command,<ref name="AF"/> and was [[Mentioned in Despatches|Mentioned in the Despatches]] of [[Field Marshal]] [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Sir Douglas Haig]] on 7 April.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=30706|date=28 May 1918|startpage=6202|supp=yes|accessdaymonth=26 August|accessyear=2008}}</ref> Throughout June and July, Wark temporarily commanded the 32nd Battalion,<ref name="AF"/> which had played little part in the German [[Spring Offensive]].<ref name="32nd"/> The battalion took part in the [[Battle of Amiens]] on 8 August, and "was subsequently involved in the operations that continued to press the retreating Germans through August and into September".<ref name="32nd"/>

===Victoria Cross, September 1918 to repatriation, September 1919===
From 29 September to 1 October 1918, Wark assumed temporary command of the 32nd Battalion, leading the unit in the [[5th Division (Australia)|5th Division's]] attack against the [[Hindenburg Line]] at [[Bellicourt]], and the subsequent advance through [[Nauroy]], Etricourt, Magny La Fosse and [[Joncourt]]. This series of battles became the 32nd Battalion's final actions for the war,<ref name="32nd"/> and it was during this period that Wark earned his Victoria Cross.<ref name="VCs58">{{Harvnb|Gliddon|2000|p=58}}</ref>

The 32nd Battalion was to commence its attack at Bellicourt at 09:00 on 29 September, and move south through the village.<ref name="AF"/> Due to mist and smoke from a preceding artillery barrage, visibility was poor. When the advance was held up by two German machine guns, Wark ordered a tank to neutralise them. On reaching the southern end of St Quentin Canal tunnel, Wark came across two hundred troops of the 117th American Regiment who appeared to be leaderless, and attached them to his own command. A short time later, with visibility still poor, he appropriated armoured reinforcements and began an advance on the village of Nauroy. As the fog began to lift, Wark organised his troops for an attack on the village from a southerly direction. By 11:30, the battalion had taken the village, along with forty Germans as [[prisoners of war]].<ref name="VCs58"/>

Shortly afterwards, Wark observed a battery of German 77&nbsp;mm guns firing on his rear companies, causing heavy casualties. Collecting a party of his men, he rushed the battery and succeeded in capturing four guns in conjunction with ten crewmen. With only two men, he pushed forward and surprised fifty Germans near [[Magny-la-Fosse]] who subsequently surrendered.<ref>{{Harvnb|Arthur|2005|p=347}}</ref> At 15:00, he halted his battalion near Joncourt, and sent out patrols which found the town still occupied by enemy forces.<ref name="AF"/> The 32nd Battalion responded by withdrawing slightly and strengthening its line. At 17:30, the Germans launched a counter-attack that was repulsed with the assistance of the 31st Battalion, together with some men from the [[46th (North Midland) Infantry Division]].<ref name="VCs58"/>

At 07:00 the next day, the 32nd Battalion attacked once more, advancing {{Convert|1500|m|yd}} to a point just north of Etricourt.<ref name="AF"/> Under heavy shelling and machine gun fire, they established a line between Joncourt and Etricourt.<ref name="VCs58"/> On 1 October, at 06:00, with a company attached from the 30th Battalion, the 32nd Battalion launched an attack that cut through Joncourt. Leading from the front, Wark dashed forward and silenced machine guns that were causing heavy casualties; this enabled the 5th Division to complete its task of forcing through to the Beaurevoir Line.<ref name="AF"/>

The full citation for Wark's Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to the ''London Gazette'' on 26 December 1918, reading:<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=31082|date=26 December 1918|startpage=15117|endpage=15118|supp=yes|accessdaymonth=26 August|accessyear=2008}}</ref>

{{quote|''War Office, 26th December, 1918''

His Majesty the KING has been graciously pleased to approve of the award of the Victoria Cross to the undermentioned Officers, N.C.O.'s and Men: <U+2014>

Maj. Blair Anderson Wark, D.S.O., 32nd Bn., A.I.F.

For most conspicuous bravery, initiative and control during the period 29th Sept. to 1st Oct. 1918, in the operations against the Hindenburg Line at Bellicourt and the advance through Nauroy, Etricourt, Magny La Fosse and Joncourt.

On 29th Sept., after personal reconnaissance under heavy fire, he led his command forward at a critical period and restored the situation. Moving fearlessly at the head of, and at times far in advance of, his troops, he cheered his men on through Nauroy, thence towards Etricourt. Still leading his assaulting companies, he observed a battery of 77mm. guns firing on his rear companies and causing heavy casualties. Collecting a few of his men, he rushed the battery, capturing four guns and ten of the crew. Then moving rapidly forward with only two N.C.O.s, he surprised and captured fifty Germans near Magny La Fosse.

On 1st Oct., 1918, he again showed fearless leading and gallantry in attack, and without hesitation and regardless of personal risk dashed forward and silenced machine guns which were causing heavy casualties.

Throughout he displayed the greatest courage, skilful leading and devotion to duty, and his work was invaluable.}}

The 32nd Battalion was resting and retraining away from the frontline when the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi<U+00E8>gne)|Armistice]] was signed on 11 November 1918.<ref name="32nd"/> On 5 January 1919, Wark was granted leave to the United Kingdom,<ref name="AIF"/> where he accepted his Victoria Cross from [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] on 13 February.<ref name="VCs60"/> Returning to his unit six days later, Wark was then assigned to the 30th Battalion, and sent back to England in preparation for demobilisation.<ref name="AIF"/> On 31 May 1919, Wark married Phyllis Marquiss Munro at St George's Parish Church, Worthington, Sussex; ten days later, he boarded HT ''Port Lyttleton'' to return to Australia, where he was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 28 September 1919. Two of Wark's brothers also served in the First World War, both in the 56th Battalion; Alexander was a sergeant, while Keith, a recipient of the [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]], rose to the rank of lieutenant.<ref name="AIF"/>
