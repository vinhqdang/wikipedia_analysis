This is a comprehensive '''discography for [[Nation of Ulysses]]''', a [[Washington, D.C.]]-based band formed in 1988, consisting of [[Ian Svenonius]], James Canty, Steve Gamboa, Steve Kroner, and Tim Green.<ref name="Membership Profiles">{{cite web

After releasing ''Plays Pretty for Baby'', the band began recording a third full-length album, but Steve Kroner separated from the band before recording was completed.  The remaining quartet continued to record, but the group eventually dissolved before the record's completion.  In 2000, six songs from those sessions, in addition to four new tracks recorded live, were compiled and released posthumously as ''[[The Embassy Tapes]]''.<ref name="ENotes">{{cite web

In addition to their three-full length albums, the Nation of Ulysses released two nearly identical vinyl EPs.  The first, a self-titled EP, was the band's first official release, but went out of print when the three tracks from it were included in ''13-Point Program to Destroy America''.  The same three tracks were again released in 1992 under the title ''The Birth of the Ulysses Aesthetic (the synthesis of speed and transformation)''.<ref name="NoU">{{cite web
