These substances are [[Serial dilution|serially diluted]], with shaking ("succussing") between each step, under the belief that this increases the effect of the treatment.

[[Image:Beydeman Gomeopatiya vzir.jpg|thumb|right|1857 painting by Alexander Beydeman showing historical figures and personifications of homeopathy observing the perceived brutality of medicine of the 19th century]]

===Historical context===
Homeopathy came about in the late 18th century, when mainstream medicine employed such measures as [[bloodletting]] and purging, the use of [[laxative]]s and [[enema]]s, and the administration of complex mixtures, such as [[Venice treacle]], which was made from 64 substances including opium, myrrh, and viper's flesh.<ref>

[[File:SamuelHahnemanninLondon.jpg|thumb|left|80px|<sub>Another portrait of [[Samuel Hahnemann|Hahnemann]]</sub>]]
Hahnemann conceived of homeopathy while translating a medical treatise by [[Scotland|Scottish]] physician and chemist [[William Cullen]] into [[German language|German]].<ref name="homhist1"/> Being skeptical of Cullen's theory concerning [[cinchona]]'s action in [[malaria]], Hahnemann ingested some of the bark specifically to see if it cured fever "by virtue of its effect of strengthening the stomach".<ref>

 |accessdate=2008-08-13
}}</ref> Upon ingesting the bark, he noticed few stomach symptoms, but did experience [[fever]], [[shivering]] and [[arthralgia|joint pain]], symptoms similar to some of the early symptoms of [[malaria]], the disease that the bark was ordinarily used to treat. From this, Hahnemann came to believe that all effective drugs produce symptoms in healthy individuals similar to those of the diseases that they treat. This later became known as the "law of similars", the most important concept of homeopathy.<ref name=homhist1>

==General philosophy==
Homeopathy is a [[vitalism|vitalist]] philosophy in that it regards diseases and sickness to be caused by disturbances in a hypothetical [[vital force]] or [[spiritual energy|life force]] in humans and that these disturbances manifest themselves as unique symptoms. Homeopathy maintains that the vital force has the ability to react and adapt to internal and external causes, which homeopaths refer to as the "law of susceptibility". The law of susceptibility states that a negative state of mind can attract hypothetical disease entities called "miasms" to invade the body and produce symptoms of diseases.<ref name="homhist1"/> However, Hahnemann rejected the notion of a disease as a separate thing or invading entity<ref>

===Law of similars===
Hahnemann observed from his experiments with [[cinchona]] bark, used as a treatment for [[malaria]], that the effects he experienced from ingesting the bark were similar to the symptoms of malaria. He therefore reasoned that cure proceeds through similarity, and that treatments must be able to produce symptoms in healthy individuals similar to those of the disease being treated. Through further experiments with other substances, Hahnemann conceived of the "law of similars", otherwise known as "like cures like" ({{lang-la|similia similibus curentur}}) as a fundamental healing principle. He believed that by inducing a disease through use of drugs, the artificial symptoms empowered the vital force to neutralise and expel the original disease and that this artificial disturbance would naturally subside when the dosing ceased.<ref name="homhist1"/>

===Miasms and disease===
Hahnemann found as early as 1816 that the patients he treated through homeopathy still suffered from chronic diseases that he was unable to cure.<ref>

Hahnemann's miasm theory remains disputed and controversial within homeopathy even in modern times. In 1978, [[Anthony Campbell]], then a consultant physician at The Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, criticised statements by [[George Vithoulkas]] claiming that [[syphilis]], when treated with antibiotics, would develop into secondary and tertiary syphilis with involvement of the central nervous system. This conflicts with scientific studies, which indicate that [[penicillin]] treatment produces a complete cure of syphilis in more than 90% of cases.<ref name="Birnbaum">{{cite journal

Originally Hahnemann presented only three miasms, of which the most important was "psora" ([[Greek language|Greek]] for ''itch''), described as being related to any itching diseases of the skin, supposed to be derived from suppressed [[scabies]], and claimed to be the foundation of many further disease conditions. Hahnemann believed psora to be the cause of such diseases as [[epilepsy]], [[cancer]], [[jaundice]], [[deafness]], and [[cataracts]].<ref name="OrganonH"/> Since Hahnemann's time, other miasms have been proposed, some replacing one or more of psora's proposed functions, including [[Tuberculosis|tubercular]] miasms and [[cancer]] miasms.<ref name=ntlworld>

==Preparation of remedies==
[[Image:Mortar2.jpg|thumb|right|Mortar and pestle used for grinding insoluble solids into homeopathic remedies including quartz and oyster shells.]]

===Dilution and succussion===
{{main|Homeopathic dilutions}}
In producing treatments for diseases, homeopaths use a process called "dynamisation" or "potentisation" whereby the remedy is diluted with alcohol or [[distilled water]] and then vigorously shaken by ten hard strikes against an elastic body in a process called "succussion". While Hehnemann advocated remedies which present symptoms similar to those of the disease he believed concentrated doses would only intensify the symptoms and exacerbate the condition, hence the dilution of the remedies. During the process of potentisation, homeopaths believe that the vital energy of the diluted substance is activated and its energy released by vigorous shaking of the substance. For this purpose, Hahnemann had a saddle maker construct a special wooden striking board covered in leather on one side and stuffed with horsehair.<ref>

</ref> Insoluble solids, such as [[quartz]] and [[oyster]] shell, are diluted by grinding them with [[lactose]] (''[[trituration]]'').

Three potency scales are in regular use in homeopathy. Hahnemann created the centesimal or "C scale", diluting a substance by a factor of 100 at each stage. The centesimal scale was favored by Hahnemann for most of his life. A 2C dilution requires a substance to be diluted to one part in one hundred, and then some of that diluted solution diluted by a further factor of one hundred. This works out to one part of the original solution mixed into 9,999 parts (100 <U+00D7> 100 <U+2212>1) of the diluent.<ref>
In standard chemistry, this produces a substance with a concentration of 0.01%, measured by the [[Concentration#Volume-volume_percentage|volume-volume percentage]] method.
</ref> A 6C dilution repeats this process six times, ending up with the original material diluted by a factor of 100<sup>-6</sup>=10<sup>-12</sup>. Higher dilutions follow the same pattern. In homeopathy, a solution that is more dilute is described as having a higher ''potency'', and more dilute substances are considered by homeopaths to be stronger and deeper-acting remedies.<ref>{{cite web

Some homeopaths developed a decimal scale (D or X), diluting the substance to ten times its original volume each stage. The D or X scale dilution is therefore half that of the same value of the C scale; for example, "12X" is the same level of dilution as "6C". Hahnemann never used this scale but it was very popular throughout the 19th century and still is in Europe. This potency scale appears to have been introduced in the 1830s by the American homeopath, [[Constantine Hering]].<ref name=Dudgeon>

Not all homeopaths advocate extremely high dilutions. Many of the early homeopaths were originally doctors and generally tended to use lower dilutions such as "3X" or "6X", rarely going beyond "12X". The split between lower and higher dilutions followed ideological lines with the former stressing [[pathology]] and a strong link to conventional medicine, while the latter emphasised vital force, miasms and a [[spirituality|spiritual]] interpretation of disease.<ref>

===Provings===
In order to determine which specific remedies could be used to treat which diseases, Hahnemann experimented on himself and others for several years before using remedies on patients. His experiments did not initially consist of giving remedies to the sick, because he thought that the most similar remedy, by virtue of its ability to induce symptoms similar to the disease itself, would make it impossible to determine which symptoms came from the remedy and which from the disease itself. Therefore, sick people were excluded from these experiments. The method used for determining which remedies were suitable for specific diseases was called "proving", after the original [[German language|German]] word "Pr<U+00FC>fung", meaning "test". A homeopathic proving is the method by which the [[Profile (engineering)|profile]] of a homeopathic remedy is determined.<ref>

At first Hahnemann used molecular doses for provings, but he later advocated proving with remedies at a 30C dilution,<ref name = "Hahnemann-128"/> and most modern provings are carried out using ultradilute remedies in which it is highly unlikely that any of the original molecules remain.<ref>Kayne, S. B. and Caldwell, I. M. (2006). [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=w2IFcHJYTSYC&pg=PA52&dq=homeopathic+proving+method ''Homeopathic pharmacy: theory and practice''].  2nd Ed. Elsevier Health Sciences, p.52</ref> During the proving process, Hahnemann administered remedies to healthy volunteers, and the resulting symptoms were compiled by observers into a "Drug Picture". The volunteers were observed for months at a time and made to keep extensive journals detailing all of their symptoms at specific times throughout the day. They were forbidden from consuming coffee, tea, spices, or wine for the duration of the experiment; playing chess was also prohibited because Hahnemann considered it to be "too exciting", though they were allowed to drink beer and encouraged to excercise in moderation. After the experiments were over, Hahnemann made the volunteers take an oath swearing that what they reported in their journals was the truth, at which time he would interrogate them extensively concerning their symptoms.

Provings have been described as important in the development of the [[clinical trial]], due to their early use of simple control groups, systematic and quantitative procedures, and some of the first application of [[statistics]] in medicine.<ref>

===Repertory===
[[Image:Rep1.JPG|thumb|Homeopathic repertory by James Tyler Kent.]]

A compilation of reports of many homeopathic provings is known as a ''homeopathic materia medica''. In practice the usefulness of such a compilation is limited because a practitioner does not need to look up the symptoms for a particular remedy, but rather to explore the remedies for a particular symptom. This need is filled by the ''homeopathic repertory'', which is an index of symptoms, listing after each symptom those remedies that are associated with it. Repertories are often very extensive and may include data from clinical experience in addition to provings. There is often lively debate among the compilers of a repertory and interested practitioners over the veracity of a particular inclusion. The first symptomatic index of the homeopathic materia medica was arranged by Hahnemann. Soon after, one of his students [[Clemens Maria Franz von B<U+00F6>nninghausen|Clemens von B<U+00F6>nninghausen]], created the ''Therapeutic pocket book'', another homeopathic repertory.<ref>

==Treatments==
Homeopaths generally begin with detailed examinations of their patients' histories, including questions regarding their physical, mental and emotional states, their life circumstances and any physical or emotional illnesses. The homeopath then attempts to translate this information into a complex formula of mental and physical symptoms, including likes, dislikes, innate predispositions and even body type.<ref name=Stehlin>

}}</ref> The goal is to develop a comprehensive representation of each individual's overall health. This information can then be compared with similar lists in the drug provings found in the homeopathic materia medica. Assisted by further dialogues with the patient, the homeopath then aims to find the drug most closely matching the "symptom totality" of the patient. There are many methods for determining the most-similar remedy (the ''simillimum''), and homeopaths sometimes disagree. This is partly due to the insurmountable complexity of the "totality of symptoms" concept. That is, homeopaths do not include all symptoms when determining which medicine is most appropriate, but decide for themselves which are the most characteristic. This subjective evaluation of case analysis relies on the knowledge and experience of the homeopath doing the diagnosis.

Some diversity in approaches to treatments exists among homeopaths. "Classical" homeopathy generally involves detailed examinations of a patient's history and infrequent doses of a single remedy as the patient is monitored for improvements in symptoms, while "clinical" homeopathy involves combinations of remedies to address the various symptoms of an illness.<ref name=pmid12614092/>

"Remedy" is a technical term used in homeopathy to refer to a substance prepared with a particular procedure and intended for treating patients. Homeopathic practitioners rely on two types of reference when prescribing remedies: Materia medicae and repertories. A homeopathic Materia medica is a collection of "drug pictures", organised alphabetically by remedy, that describes the symptom patterns associated with individual remedies. A homeopathic repertory is an index of disease symptoms that lists remedies associated with specific symptoms.<ref name=elixris>

Homeopathy uses many animal, plant, mineral, and synthetic substances in its remedies. Examples include ''[[Arsenicum album]]'' (arsenic oxide), ''Natrum muriaticum'' ([[sodium chloride]] or table salt), ''[[Lachesis muta]]'' (the venom of the [[bushmaster (snake)|bushmaster]] [[snake]]), ''[[Opium]]'', and ''Thyroidinum'' ([[thyroid hormone]]). Homeopaths also use treatments called ''nosodes'' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''nosos'', disease) made from diseased or pathological products such as fecal, urinary, and respiratory discharges, blood, and tissue.<ref name="pmid16322800">

Some modern homeopaths have considered more esoteric substances, known as "imponderables" because they do not originate from a material but from [[electromagnetic energy]] presumed to have been "captured" by alcohol or lactose. Examples include [[X-ray]]s, [[sunlight]],<ref>

These include ''paper remedies'', where the substance and dilution are written on a piece of paper and either pinned to the patient's clothing, put in their pocket, or placed under a glass of water that is then given to the patient, as well as the use of [[radionics]] to prepare remedies. Such practices have been strongly criticised by classical homeopaths as unfounded, speculative and verging upon magic and superstition.<ref>

===Isopathy===
Isopathy is a therapy derived from homeopathy and was invented by Johann Joseph Wilhelm Lux in the 1830s.<ref name=Bellavite/> Isopathy differs from homeopathy in general in that the remedies are made up either from things that cause the [[disease]], or from products of the disease, such as [[pus]]. Many so-called "homeopathic vaccines" are a form of isopathy.<ref>

===Flower remedies===
Flower remedies can be produced by placing flowers in water and exposing them to sunlight. The most famous of these are the [[Bach flower remedies]], which were developed by the homeopath [[Edward Bach]]. The relationship between these remedies and homeopathy is controversial. On the one hand, the proponents of these remedies share homeopathy's vitalist world-view and the remedies are claimed to act through the same hypothetical "vital force". However, although many of the same plants are used as in homeopathy, the method of preparation is somewhat different, with Bach flower therapies supposedly being prepared in "gentler" ways, such as placing flowers in bowls of sunlit water, and so on.<ref>

=== High dilutions ===
The extremely high dilutions in homeopathy have been a main point of criticism. Homeopaths believe that the methodical dilution of a substance, beginning with a 10% or lower solution and working downwards, with shaking after each dilution, produces a therapeutically active "remedy", in contrast to therapeutically inert water. However, homeopathic remedies are usually diluted to the point where there are no molecules from the original solution left in a dose of the final remedy.<ref name=Milgrom>

Practitioners of homeopathy contend that higher dilutions (fewer potential molecules in each dose) result in stronger medicinal effects. This idea is inconsistent with the observed [[dose-response relationship]]s of conventional drugs, where the effects are dependent on the concentration of the active ingredient in the body.<ref name=Levy/> This dose-response relationship has been confirmed in multitudinous experiments on organisms as diverse as nematodes,<ref>

A 2007 systematic review of homeopathy for children and adolescents found that the evidence for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and childhood diarrhea was mixed. No difference from placebo was found for adenoid vegetation, asthma, or upper respiratory tract infection.

found 32 trials that met their inclusion criteria, 19 of which were placebo-controlled and provided enough data for meta-analysis. These 19 studies showed a pooled odds ratio of 1.17 to 2.23 in favor of individualized homeopathy over the placebo, but no difference was seen when the analysis was restricted to the methodologically best trials. The authors concluded "that the results of the available randomized trials suggest that individualized homeopathy has an effect over placebo. The evidence, however, is not convincing because of methodological shortcomings and inconsistencies."

Jack Killen, acting deputy director of the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]], says homeopathy "goes beyond current understanding of chemistry and physics."

In 1987, French immunologist [[Jacques Benveniste]] submitted a paper to the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' while working at [[INSERM]]. The paper purported to have discovered that [[basophils]] released [[histamine]] when exposed to a homeopathic dilution of anti-immunoglobulin E, a type of [[white blood cell]]. The journal editors, sceptical of the results, requested that the study be replicated in a separate laboratory. Upon replication in four separate laboratories the study was published. Still sceptical of the findings, ''Nature'' assembled an independent investigative team to determine the accuracy of the research, consisting of ''Nature'' editor and physicist Sir [[John Maddox]], American scientific fraud investigator and chemist Walter Stewart, and sceptic and magician [[James Randi]]. After investigating the findings and methodology of the experiment, the team found that the experiments were "statistically ill-controlled", "interpretation has been clouded by the exclusion of measurements in conflict with the claim", and concluded, "We believe that experimental data have been uncritically assessed and their imperfections inadequately reported."<ref>

== Ethical and safety issues ==
As homeopathic remedies usually contain only water and/or alcohol, they are thought to be generally safe. Only in rare cases are the original ingredients present at detectable levels. This may be due to improper preparation or intentional low dilution. Instances of [[arsenic poisoning]] have occurred after use of arsenic-containing homeopathic preparations.<ref name=pmid14705842 /> [[Zinc gluconate#Safety concerns|Zicam Nasal Spray]], which contains 2X (1:100) zinc gluconate, reportedly caused a small percentage of users to lose their sense of smell;<ref>

Critics of homeopathy have cited other concerns over homeopathic remedies, most seriously, cases of patients of homeopathy failing to receive proper treatment for diseases that it is claimed could have been diagnosed or cured with conventional medicine. Several surveys demonstrate that some (particularly non-physician) homeopaths advise their patients against [[vaccine|immunisation]].<ref name="pmid8554846">

In 1978, [[Anthony Campbell]], then a consultant physician at The Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, criticised statements made by [[George Vithoulkas]] to promote his homeopathic treatments. Vithoulkas stated that [[syphilis]], when treated with antibiotics, would develop into secondary and tertiary syphilis with involvement of the [[central nervous system]]. Campbell described this as a thoroughly irresponsible statement which could mislead an unfortunate layman into refusing conventional medical treatment.<ref name = "minimum-67-4"/> This claim echoes the idea that treating a disease with external medication used to treat the symptoms would only drive it deeper into the body and conflicts with scientific studies, which indicate that penicillin treatment produces a complete cure of syphilis in more than 90% of cases.<ref name="Birnbaum"/>

A 2006 review by W. Steven Pray of the College of Pharmacy at [[Southwestern Oklahoma State University]] recommends that pharmacy colleges include a required course in unproven medications and therapies, that ethical dilemmas inherent in recommending products lacking proven safety and efficacy data be discussed, and that students should be taught where unproven systems such as homeopathy depart from evidence-based medicine.<ref>

[[Edzard Ernst]], the first ''Professor of [[alternative medicine|Complementary Medicine]]'' in the [[United Kingdom]], has expressed his concerns about [[pharmacist]]s who violate their ethical code by failing to provide customers with "necessary and relevant information" about the true nature of the homeopathic products they advertise and sell:

: "My plea is simply for honesty. Let people buy what they want, but tell them the truth about what they are buying. These treatments are biologically implausible and the clinical tests have shown they don't do anything at all in human beings. The argument that this information is not relevant or important for customers is quite simply ridiculous."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/jul/21/pharmacists.homeophathy | title = Pharmacists urged to 'tell the truth' about homeopathic remedies | author = Ian Sample | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 2008-07-21 | accessdate = 2008-07-21 }}</ref>

==Regulation and prevalence==
{{main|Regulation and prevalence of homeopathy}}
[[Image:WomanHomeopathy.jpg|thumb|Woman looking at homeopathic remedies]]

Homeopathy is fairly common in some countries while being uncommon in others; is highly regulated in some countries and mostly unregulated in others. Regulations vary in Europe depending on the country. In some countries, there are no specific legal regulations concerning the use of homeopathy, while in others, licenses or degrees in conventional medicine from accredited universities are required. In [[Germany]], no specific regulations exist, while [[France]], [[Austria]] and [[Denmark]] mandate licenses to diagnose any illness or dispense of any product whose purpose is to treat any illness.<ref name=WHO/> Some homeopathic treatment is covered by the public health service of several European countries, including France, the [[United Kingdom]], Denmark, and [[Luxembourg]]. In other countries, such as [[Belgium]], homeopathy is not covered. In [[Austria]], the public health service requires scientific proof of effectiveness in order to reimburse medical treatments and homeopathy is listed as not reimbursable<ref>

At the start of 2004, homeopathic medications, with some exceptions, were no longer covered by the German public health service, and in June 2005, the [[Swiss]] Government, after a 5-year trial, withdrew homeopathy and four other complementary treatments, stating that they did not meet efficacy and cost-effectiveness criteria, though insurance can be bought to cover such treatments provided by a medical doctor.{{Fact|date=January 2009}}
