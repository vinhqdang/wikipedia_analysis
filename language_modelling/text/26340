'''Assata Shakur'''<ref name="namechange">''New York Times''. [[March 31]], [[1978]]. Section 2; Page 17, Column 3.</ref> ([[July 16]], [[1947]] - ), born '''Joanne Deborah Byron Chesimard''',{{fn|<U+00B0>}} is an [[African-American]] [[activist]] who was a member of the [[Black Panther Party]] and [[Black Liberation Army]]. In 1977 she was [[conviction|convicted]] of several [[felony|felonies]] in relation to the 1973 slayings of [[New Jersey State Police|New Jersey State Trooper]] Werner Foerster and fellow BLA member Zayd Malik Shakur.

She escaped from prison in 1979 and has been living in [[Cuba]] with [[List of United States citizens granted political asylum in Cuba|political asylum]] since 1984. Since [[May 2]], [[2005]], she has been classified as a "domestic terrorist" by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], which has offered a $1 million reward for assistance in her capture.

She is the non-biological<ref>Ryan, Andrew J.

==Early life==
Shakur was born in New York City on [[July 16]], [[1947]], or, according to the FBI, [[August 19]], [[1952]], but spent most of her childhood in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]<ref name="scheffler203">Scheffler, p. 203.</ref> until her family relocated to [[Queens]] when she was a teenager. She attended [[Borough of Manhattan Community College]] and [[City College of New York]] in the mid 1960s, where she was involved in many political activities. After graduation, Shakur became involved in the [[Black Panther Party]] and the [[Black Liberation Army]].<ref name="james">James, Matthew Thomas. Joy James (Ed.). 2005.

Msgr. John Powis alleged that Shakur was involved in an armed robbery at his Our Lady of the Presentation church in [[Brownsville, Brooklyn]] on [[September 14]], [[1972]] based on [[FBI]] photographs; Shakur was not charged with this robbery and the only person arrested for it was acquitted.<ref name="Daily News Article"> Daly, Michael. 2006, December 13. "[http://www.nydailynews.com/12-13-2006/news/story/479642p-403539c.html The Msgr. & the Militant]." ''New York Daily News''.</ref>

In 1972, Shakur was made the subject of a nationwide manhunt after the F.B.I. alleged that she was the "revolutionary mother hen" of a Black Liberation Army cell which had conducted a "series of cold-blooded murders of [[New York City Police Department|New York City police officers]]."<ref name="churchill308"/> After her capture, however, Shakur was charged with none of the killings which had made her the subject of the manhunt.<ref name="churchill308"/>

==New Jersey Turnpike shootout==
[[Image:assatamugshot.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mugshot]] of Shakur, taken on May 2, 1973]]
On [[May 2]], [[1973]], just after midnight,<ref name="kirsta"/> Shakur, at that time a member of the [[Black Liberation Army]] and no longer a member of the Black Panther Party, along with Zayd Malik Shakur (born James F Coston) and [[Sundiata Acoli]] (born Clark Squire), was stopped on the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] in [[East Brunswick Township, New Jersey|East Brunswick]] by State Troopers James Harper and Werner Foerster, for driving with a broken taillight, only 200 yards away from a police administration buidling.<ref name="kirsta"/> Accounts of the confrontation differ (see the [[Assata Shakur#Witnesses|witnesses section]] below), but Zayd Shakur and Trooper Foerester were killed in the ensuing shootout, and Assata Shakur and Trooper Harper were injured.

Acoli then drove the car (a white [[Pontiac LeMans]] with [[Vermont]] [[license plate]]s)<ref name="kirsta"/>&mdash;which contained Assata, who was wounded, and Zayd, who was dead&mdash;several miles down the road, where Assata Shakur was apprehended. Acoli then exited the car and fled into the woods and was captured after a manhunt the following day.<ref>Marpessa Kupendua. 1998, January 28.

==Trials==
Between 1973 and 1977, in [[New York]] and [[New Jersey]], Shakur was indicted ten times, resulting in seven different criminal trials, including two [[bank robbery|bank robberies]], the [[kidnapping]] of a [[Brooklyn]] [[heroin]] dealer, [[attempted murder]] of two [[Queens]] police officers steming from a [[January 23]], [[1973]] failed ambush, and the murder of a New Jersey state trooper.<ref name="taylor">Taylor, Mark Lewis. 1999, January 17.

November 2, 1974. Page 36, Column 4.</ref> for this trial, Shakur had been [[Extradition|extradited]] to New York City on [[May 16]].<ref>''New York Times''. May 7, 1974. Page 96, Column 5.</ref> In October 1977, New York State Superior Court Justice John Starkey dropped murder and robbery charges against Shakur related to the hold up of a Brooklyn club in which Richard Nelson was killed on the grounds that the state had delayed too long in bringing her to trial.<ref>Max H. Seigel. October 26, 1977. ''New York Times''. Page 25, Column 5.</ref>

Judge Leon Gerofsky ordered a [[change of venue]] in 1973 to [[Morris County, New Jersey]], saying "it was almost impossible to obtain a jury here comprised of people willing to accept the responsibility of impartiality so that defendants will be protected from transitory passion and prejudice."<ref name="Hershberger">James Hershberger.

''Covert Action Quarterly''.</ref> By the time her 1977 trial started, Acoli had already been convicted of firing the bullets which killed Trooper Foerster,<ref name="churchill308"/> and a total of 289 articles had been published in the local press, most portraying Shakur as a dangerous and mentioning her alleged involvement in the various violent crimes for which she had not been convicted.<ref name="kirsta"/> Polls of residents in Middlesex County showed that 83% knew her identity and 70% said she was guilty.<ref name="kirsta"/>

After a widely-publicized nine-week trial,<ref name="kirsta"/> on [[March 25]], [[1977]]&mdash;back in [[Middlesex County, New Jersey]]&mdash;Shakur was convicted as an [[accomplice]] in the [[Felony murder|murders]] of New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster and Zayd Shakur and possession of weapons, as well as of [[assault]] and [[attempted murder]] of Trooper Harper. Although the prosecution could not prove that Shakur fired the shots that killed either Trooper Foerester or Zayd Shakur, being an accomplice to murder carries an equivalent life sentence under New Jersey law.<ref name="kirsta">Alix Kirsta. May 29, 1999. "A black and white case - Investigation - Joanne Chesimard."

The judge did not allow evidence of alleged [[COINTELPRO]] involvement to be admitted during her trial.<ref name="joy"/> Shakur's defense attorney's had attempted to [[subpoena]] FBI Director [[Clarence M. Kelley|Clarence Kelley]], Senator [[Frank Church]] and other Federal and New York law enforcement officials to testify about the Counter Intelligence Program, which they alleged was designed to harass and disrupt black activist organizations.<ref>Joseph F. Sullivan. February 24, 1977. ''New York Times''. Page 76, Column 1.</ref>

Shakur's attorney's had also successfully asked a 10-judge panel of the Federal Philadelphia Court of Appeals to order that sessions for her murder trial not be held on Fridays because of [[Black Muslims|Black Muslim Sabbath]], although Appeals Court rejected her plea to move the murder trial to a federal court.<ref>Donald Janson. February 19, 1977. ''New York Times'' Page 51, Column 1.</ref><ref>''New York Times''.  January 27, 1977. Page 76, Column 2.</ref>

===Defense attorneys===
Shakur's defense attorneys included [[Lennox Hinds]], [[William Kunstler]], [[Evelyn Williams]], [[Bob Bloom]], [[Florynce Kennedy]], [[Ray Brown (lawyer)|Ray Brown]], and Stanley Cohen, who died of unknown causes early on in Shakur's last trial.<ref name="nelson"/><ref>''Assata'', p. 247.</ref> 

Her attorney's, in particular Lennox Hinds, were often held in [[contempt of court]], which the [[National Conference of Black Lawyers]] cited as an example of systemic bias in the judicial system.<ref>''New York Times''. May 9, 1977. Page 67, Column 6.</ref> The New Jersey Legal Ethics Committee also investigated complaints against Hinds for comparing Shakur's murder trial to "legalized lynching"<ref>''New York Times''. March 2, 1977. Section 2, Page 21, Column 2.</ref> undertaken by a "[[kangaroo court]]."<ref name="kirsta"/> Judge Appleby also threatened Kunstler with dismissal and contempt of court after he delivered an [[October 21]], [[1976]] speech at [[Rutgers University]] which in part discussed the upcoming trial,<ref>Martin Waldron. December 3, 1976. ''New York Times''. Section 2, Page 21, Column 1.</ref> but later ruled that Kunstler could represent Shakur.<ref>''New York Times''. December 15, 1976. Section 2, Page 53, Column 1.</ref> Until obtaining a court order, Williams was forced to strip naked and undergo a body search before each of her visits with Shakur&mdash;during which Shakur was shackled to a bed by both ankles.<ref name="kirsta"/>

Judge Appleby also refused to investigate a burglary of her defense counsel's office which resulted in the disappearance of trial documents.<ref name="joy"/>

===Witnesses===

Sundiata Acoli, Assata Shakur, Trooper  Harper, and a New Jersey Turnpike driver who saw part of the incident were the only surviving witnesses.<ref name="williamsfacts">Evelyn A. Williams. 2005, June 25. "[http://assatashakur.org/appeal_case_facts_2005.htm Statement of Facts in the New Jersey trial of Assata Shakur]."</ref> 

Acoli did not testify or make any pre-trial statements, nor did he testify in his own trial or given a statement to the police.<ref>Jonathan Schuppe. February 8, 2004. "In parole bid, Chesimard cohort denies killing trooper." ''The Star-Ledger''.</ref> The driver traveling North on the turnpike testified that he had seen a State Trooper struggling with a Black man between a white vehicle and a State Trooper car, whose revolving lights illuminated the area.<ref name="williamsfacts"/>

Shakur testified that Trooper Harper shot her after she raised her arms to comply with his demand, the second shot hitting her in the back as she was turning to avoid it, and that she climbed into the backseat of the Pontiac which Acoli drove five miles down the road and parked, and remained there until State Troopers dragged her onto the road.<ref name="williamsfacts"/>

Trooper Harper's three official reports state that after he stopped the Pontiac, he ordered Acoli to the back of the vehicle  for Trooper Foerster&mdash;who had arrived on the scene&mdash;to examine his [[driver's license]], and that after Acoli complied and as he was looking inside the vehicle to examine the [[vehicle registration|registration]], Trooper Foerster yelled and held up an ammunition clip, as Shakur simultaneously reached into her red [[purse|pocketbook]], pulled out a [[9 mm caliber|nine-millimeter weapon]] and fired at him. Trooper Harper's reports then state that he ran to the rear of his car and shot at Assata Shakur who had exited the vehicle and was firing from a crouched position next to the vehicle.<ref name="taylor"/>

Under [[cross-examination]] at both Acoli and Shakur's trials, Trooper Harper admitted to having lied in these reports and in his [[Grand Jury]] testimony about Trooper Foerster yelling and showing him an ammunition clip, about seeing Shakur holding a pocketbook or a gun inside the vehicle, and about Shakur shooting at him from the car.<ref name="taylor"/><ref name="kirsta"/>

===Medical evidence===
A key element of Shakur's defense was [[forensic biology|medical testimony]] meant to demonstrate that she was shot with her hands up and that she would have been subsequently unable to fire a weapon. A [[neurologist]] testified that the [[median nerve]] in Shakur's right arm was severed by the second bullet, making her unable to pull a trigger.<ref name="hinds"/> 

Neurosurgeon Dr. Arthur Turner Davidson, Associate Professor of Surgery at [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]], testified that the wounds in her upper arms, armpit and chest, and severed median nerve that instantly paralysed her right arm, would only have been caused if both arms were raised, and that to sustain such injuries while crouching and firing a weapon "would be anatomically impossible."<ref name="kirsta"/><ref>Walter H. Waggoner. March 17, 1977. ''New York Times''. Section 2, Page 20, Column 3.</ref>  

Dr. David Spain, a [[pathologist]] from [[Brookdale Community College]], testified that her bullet scars as well as [[X-ray]]s supported her claim that her arms were raised, and that there was "no conceivable way" the first bullet could have hit Shakur's [[clavicle]] if her arm was down.<ref>Joseph F. Sullivan. March 18, 1977. ''New York Times''. Section 2, Page 24, Column 1.</ref><ref>Joy James and T. Denean Sharpley-Whiting. 2000. ''The Black Feminist Reader''. Blackwell Publishing. ISBN 0631210075. p. 279.</ref>

Judge Appleby eventually cut off funds for expert defense testimony.<ref name="kirsta"/>

===Forensic evidence===
[[Neutron activation analysis]] administered after the shootout showed no [[gun powder]] residue on Shakur's fingers; her [[fingerprint]]s were not found on any weapon at the scene, according to forensic analysis performed at the [[Trenton, New Jersey]] crime lab and the F.B.I. crime labs in [[Washington, D.C.]].<ref name="howell">Ron Howell. June 7, 1998. "Revolutionary on Ice: Assata Shakur's Cuban Exile." Newsday.</ref>

===Police reports===
According to tape recordings and police reports made several hours after the shoot-out, when Harper returned on foot to the adminstration building 200 yards away, he did he report Foerster's presence at the scene; no one at headquarters knew of Foerster's involvement in the shoot-out until his body was discovered beside his patrol car, more than an hour later.<ref name="kirsta"/>

==Imprisonment==
After the Turnpike shootings, Shakur was imprisoned in New Jersey State Reception and Correction center<ref>Ward Churchill and Jim Vander Wal. p. 410.</ref> in Yardville, [[Middlesex County, New Jersey]] and later moved to [[Rikers Island|Rikers Island Correctional Institution for Women]] in [[New York City]]<ref name="scheffler203"/> where she was kept in [[solitary confinement]].<ref name="muhammad">Muhammad, Nisa Islam. 2005, May 16.

Page 40, Column 7.</ref> [[Kamau Sadiki]] (a.k.a. Fred W. X. Hilton), a co-defendant who shared a cell with Shakur during their trial for armed robbery in the Bronx (of which both were acquited), is believed to be the father.<ref name="kirsta"/>

On [[April 8]], [[1978]], Shakur was transferred to [[Alderson Federal Prison Camp]] in [[Alderson, West Virginia]] where she met [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[nationalism|nationalist]] [[Lolita Lebr<U+00F3>n]]<ref name="scheffler203"/> and Mary Alice, a Catholic nun, who introduced Shakur to the concept of [[liberation theology]].<ref name="scheffler206">Scheffler, p. 206.</ref> At Alderson, Shakur was housed in the Maximum Security Unit, which also contained several members of the Aryan Sisterhood as well as [[Sandra Good]] and [[Lynette Fromme]], followers of [[Charles Manson]].<ref>Scheffler, p. 204.</ref> 

On March 31, 1978,<ref>''New York Times''. March 31, 1978. Section 2, Page 17, Column 3.</ref>, after the Maximum Security Unit at Alderson was closed,<ref name="scheffler206"/> Shakur was transferred to the [[Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women|Clinton Correctional Facility for Women]] in [[New Jersey]].<ref name="scheffler203"/> A 1979 special [[United Nations|UN]] investigation into human rights abuses of political prisoners cited Shakur as "one of the worst cases" of such abuses and including her in a "a class of victims of FBI misconduct through the COINTELPRO strategy and other forms of illegal government conduct who as political activists have been selectively targeted for provocation, false arrests, entrapment, fabrication of evidence, and spurious criminal prosecutions."<ref name="kirsta"/><ref>''Covert Action Quarterly''. October 26, 1998. "[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/093.html The U.N. Petition]."</ref>

==Escape and political asylum in Cuba==
On [[November 2]], [[1979]] she escaped the [[Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women|Clinton Correctional Facility for Women]] in New Jersey, after members of the [[Black Liberation Army]] conducted an armed action. No one, including the guards, was injured during the prison break.<ref name="churchill308"/> Charged with assisting in her escape was her brother, [[Mutulu Shakur]], and [[Silvia Baraldini]]; Ronald Boyd Hill was also held on charges related to the escape.<ref>''New York Times''. November 29, 1979. Section 2, Page 4, Column 4.</ref> In part for his role in the event, Mutulu was named on [[July 23]], [[1982]] as the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, 1980s|380th addition to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]] list, where he remained for the next four years until his capture in 1986. State correction officials disclosed in November 1979 that they had not run [[Background check|identity checks]] on Shakur's visitors<ref>Robert Hanley. November 6, 1979. ''New York Times''. Section 2, Page 2, Column 1.</ref> and that the three men and one woman who assisted in her escape had presented false identification to enter the prison's visitor room,<ref>Robert Hanley. November 4, 1979. ''New York Times''. Page 31, Column 6.</ref> before which they were not searched.<ref name="kirsta"/>

After her escape, Assata lived as a fugitive for the next several years. The F.B.I. circulated "wanted" posters throughout the New York-New Jersey area; her supporters hung "Assata Shakur is welcome here" posters in response.<ref name="cleaver2">Cleaver, Kathleen. 2005, August. "The Fugitive." ''Essesnce''.</ref> In July 1980, FBI director [[William Hedgcock Webster|William Webster]] said that the search for Shakur had been  frustrated by residents' refusal to cooperate, and the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that his public commitments to protect civil liberties had been "clouded" by "apparently crude sweeps" through [[Harlem]] buildings, in search of Shakur.<ref>''New York Times''. July 2, 1980. "A Cloud Over the New FBI." Section A, Page 26, Column 1.</ref> In particular, one pre-dawn [[April 20]], [[1980]] raid on 92 Morningside Avenue, during which FBI agents armed with shotguns and machine guns broke down doors, and rummaged through the building for several hours while preventing residents from leaving, was percieved by residents as having "racist overtones."<ref>''New York Times''. June 11, 1980. "Our tinderboxes for radical violence." Section A, Page 30, Column 4.</ref> In October 1980, New Jersey and New York City Police denied published reports that they had declined to raid a [[Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn]] building where Shakur was suspected to be hiding for fear of provoking a racial incident.<ref>''New York Times''.

[[Image:assatabio.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Assata: An Autobiography'']]
She fled to [[Cuba]] in 1984 where she was granted [[List of United States citizens granted political asylum in Cuba|political asylum]], saying she had never received a fair trial.<ref name="cleaver2"/> In 1985 she was reunited with her daughter, Kakuya, who had previously been raised by Shakur's mother in New York.<ref name="scheffler203"/> She published ''Assata: An Autobiography'', which was written in Cuba, in 1987. Her autobiography does not give a detailed account of the events on the New Jersey Turnpike, except saying that the jury "Convicted a woman with her hands up!"<ref name="nelson"/>

Shakur, to this day, maintains her innocence, and her writings to this effect have been widely circulated on the [[internet]].<ref>''Chronic Magazine''. "[http://www.chronicmagazine.com/public.php?level=1&page_id=607 $1 million bounty on Tupac's godmother]."</ref> 

===Extradition attempts===
In 1997, Carl Williams, the superintendent of the New Jersey State Police wrote a letter to the [[Pope John Paul II]] asking him to raise the issue of Shakur's [[extradition]] during his talks with President [[Fidel Castro]].<ref>Chicago Sun Times. 1997, December 28. "N.J. cops enlist pope; Seek help in getting fugitive out of Cuba." p. 34.</ref> During the pope's visit to Cuba in 1998, Shakur agreed to an interview with NBC journalist [[Ralph Penza]].<ref name="assataletter2">Shakur, Assata. "[http://www.assatashakur.org/escape2.htm An Open Letter from Assata]." p. 2.</ref> Shakur later published an extensive criticism of the NBC segment, which interpliced footage of Trooper Foerester's grieving widow with an FBI photo connected to a bank robbery of which Shakur had been acquited.<ref>Assata Shakur and Ida E. Lewis. November 1, 2000. "Assata Shakur: Profiled and on the Run." ''[[The Crisis|New Crisis]]''. Vol. 107, Issue 6.</ref> On [[March 10]], [[1998]]&mdash;the 85th anniversary of the death of [[Harriet Tubman]]&mdash;[[Governor of New Jersey|New Jersey Governor]] [[Christine Todd Whitman]] asked [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Janet Reno]] to do whatever it takes to return Shakur from Cuba.<ref>Brath, Elombe. 1998, March 13. "[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/100.html N.J. Bloodhounds on Assata's Trail]." ''NY Daily Challenge''.</ref> Later in 1998, U.S. media widely reported claims that the [[United States Department of State|United States State Department]] had offered to lift the [[United States embargo against Cuba|Cuban embargo]] in exchange for the return of ninety U.S. political exiles, including Shakur.<ref>James, Joy. p. 115.</ref>

In 1998, the United States Congress passed a resolution asking Cuba for her "[[extradition|return]]";  House Concurrent Resolution 254 passed 371-0 in the House and by [[unanimous consent]] in the Senate.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d105:HC00254:@@@R House Concurrent Resolution 254].</ref> Many members of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] later explained that they were against her extradition, but mistakenly voted for the bill which was placed on the accelerated suspension calendar, generally reserved for non-controversial legislation.<ref>Waters, Maxine. 1998, September 29.
