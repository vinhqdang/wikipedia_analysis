The '''Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar''' was a [[half dollar (United States coin)|fifty-cent piece]] struck intermittently by the [[United States Mint|United States Bureau of the Mint]] between 1926 and 1939.  The coin was designed by [[Laura Gardin Fraser]] and [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Earle Fraser]], and commemorates those who traveled the [[Oregon Trail]] and settled the Pacific Coast of the United States in the mid-19th century.  Struck over a lengthy period in small numbers per year, the many varieties produced came to be considered a collector ripoff, and led to the end, for the time, of the [[Early United States commemorative coins|commemorative coin series]].

Ohio-born [[Ezra Meeker]] had traveled the Trail with his family in 1852 and spent the final two decades of his long life before his death in 1928 publicizing the Oregon Trail, that it should not be forgotten. In 1926, at age 95, he appeared before a Senate committee, requesting that the government issue a commemorative coin that could be sold to raise money for markers to show where the Trail had been.  Congress authorized six million half dollars, and placed no restriction on when or at what mint the coins would be struck.  Meeker's Oregon Trail Memorial Association had tens of thousands of pieces struck in 1926 and 1928, and did not sell them all.  Nevertheless, most years between 1933 and 1939, it had small quantities of the half dollar coined, in some years from all three operating mints to produce [[mint mark|mintmarked]] varieties, and raised prices considerably.

Many of the issues were controlled by coin dealers and speculators, and individual collectors had to pay high prices on the secondary market to obtain specimens.  Public protests followed, and in 1939 Congress ended the series.  Just over 260,000 of the 6,000,000 authorized coins were struck, of which about 60,000 were melted. The US commemorative coin that was struck over the longest period, the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar has been widely praised for its design, but the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]'s intended gesture of peace has often been misunderstood as a demand that westbound settlers halt.

== Background ==

{{main|Oregon Trail}}

In the middle years of the 19th century, before the completion of the [[transcontinental railroad]] in 1869 made travel easier, hundreds of thousands of people journeyed along the [[Oregon Trail]] to settle the Far West of the United States.  Not all who began the journey reached their destination as there was much suffering and death along the way<U+2014>by one estimate, 20,000 people lie in unmarked graves.{{sfn|"Meeker departs"}}{{sfn|''New York Times''|1928-12-04}}

[[File:Ezra Meeker 1921.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ezra Meeker]] in 1921 at age 90]]

Ohio-born farmer [[Ezra Meeker]] (1830<U+2013>1928) traveled the Oregon Trail in 1852; he and his young wife and infant child went by ox-drawn wagon from Iowa to [[Oregon Territory]].  He found wealth in the West, and in his old age came to believe that the Oregon Trail, and the sacrifice of those who had died along it, were being forgotten.  Amid immense publicity as one of the last survivors of the pioneers who had blazed the way west, Meeker retraced his route along the Trail between 1906 and 1908, first west to east, and then in the direction in which he had first traveled it.  The Trail had in some places disappeared, swallowed up by town and farm, and he sought to find where he had passed, pointing out important places along the Trail in the hope that historical markers would rise.  He took his oxen team and wagon across the nation to publicize his cause, parking his rig in front of the White House where he met President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. In New York, he crossed the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], and in Pasadena he and his oxen participated in the [[Tournament of Roses Parade]].  In the succeeding years, he traveled the route by oxcart, automobile, and, at age 92 in 1923, airplane, attempting to further his cause, and seeking federal recognition and funding for his efforts.{{sfn|"Meeker departs"}}{{sfn|''New York Times''|1928-12-04}}

== Authorization ==

By 1925, Congress was reluctant to authorize more commemorative coins; twelve pieces had been issued between 1920 and 1925, and many legislators felt that coins were being allowed that "commemorate[d] events of local and not national interest".{{sfn|US Mint}} The entire mintages of commemoratives were sold at face value to the sponsoring organizations designated in the authorizing acts.  These groups then sold the coins to the public at a premium, thus raising money for causes that Congress had deemed worthy.{{sfn|Webber|p=15}} Made cautious by a series of unsuccessful issues, Congress rejected a number of proposals for special coins in early 1926.  Among these were pieces to honor the completion of the [[Lincoln Highway|Lincoln]] and [[Victory Highway]]s, and a proposal to commemorate the centennial of the birth of American composer [[Stephen Foster]].{{sfn|Taxay|p=118}}

}}

The bill authorizing the Oregon Trail Memorial  [[half dollar (United States coin)|half dollar]] was first introduced in the House of Representatives on January 25, 1925 by Washington Congressman [[John Franklin Miller (Washington representative)|John Franklin Miller]], who had previously been mayor of Seattle, about {{convert|50|mi}} from Meeker's home in [[Puyallup, Washington|Puyallup]]. According to local historian Bert Webber in his 1986 monograph on the coin, "there is little doubt that Mr. Miller was influenced to propose this coin by Ezra Meeker."{{sfn|Webber|pp=10, 13}}  The bill was not opposed in the House of Representatives, though one member, Michigan Congressman [[Louis Cramton]], asked several questions before it passed by [[unanimous consent]].{{sfn|Webber|pp=16<U+2013>21}}

On April 26, 1926, the 95-year-old Meeker appeared before the  Senate<U+2019>s Committee on Banking and Currency in his capacity as president of the Oregon Trail Memorial Association, Inc. (the Association), a New York corporation.{{efn|Meeker had founded the Association in February 1922.  One could join it at the cost of one dollar.  See {{harvnb|Webber|pp=14<U+2013>15}}}}  He advocated the issuance of commemorative half dollars, which could be sold by his organization to raise funds for markers and memorials along the Trail.  Congress duly passed Public Law 325, authorizing the issuance of up to 6,000,000 half dollars to honor "the heroism of the fathers and mothers who traversed the Oregon Trail"; this was enacted into law on May 17, 1926.{{sfn|Taxay|p=118}}{{sfn|Van Ryzin}}  President [[Calvin Coolidge]] signed the bill into law on the White House lawn; Meeker was present at the [[signing ceremony]] and was photographed shaking hands with President Coolidge.{{sfn|Webber|p=21}}

The bill required that the Association pay for the half dollars at par, and that the [[coining (mint)|dies]] and other costs of preparation not be at the expense of the United States.{{sfn|Webber|p=18}} The figure of six million was the largest in American commemorative history, exceeding the five million [[Stone Mountain Memorial Half Dollar|commemorative half dollars]] authorized in support of the building of the [[Stone Mountain]] sculpture in Georgia.  Congress placed no restriction on which mint should strike the coins, and did not put a time limit on the authorization.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=80, 88}}  According to numismatists Anthony Swiatek and [[Walter Breen]] in their encyclopedia of US commemoratives, the bill passed "possibly because the stated purpose was nationalistic rather than obscurely local".{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=181}}  Coin dealer and author [[Q. David Bowers]] states that "on the surface the motivation seemed to be good enough&nbsp;... doubtless many American citizens had family ties to the famous migration".{{sfn|Bowers|p=88}}

== Preparation and design ==

Meeker wanted the new half dollars struck as quickly as possible; he was planning another journey west on the Trail, and wanted to be able to sell the coins along the way.{{sfn|Taxay|p=122}}{{sfn|''New York Times''|1926-07-11}}  The Association initially contacted [[Chester Beach]], designer of the 1923 [[James Monroe|Monroe]] Centennial half dollar, to sculpt the new coin, but he was unavailable, though he prepared sketches.  Instead, the Association turned to the husband-and-wife team of [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Earle Fraser]] and [[Laura Gardin Fraser]].{{sfn|Taxay|pp=63, 118}}  James Fraser had designed the [[Buffalo nickel]]; his wife had created several commemorative coins, including the Grant Centennial dollar and half dollar.{{sfn|''CoinSite''}}

James Fraser designed one side (the wagon side),{{efn|Which side is the obverse and which the reverse is a matter of dispute.  The Frasers considered the Indian side the obverse; the Mint considered the wagon side, with the date, to be the obverse. See {{harvnb|Bowers|p=88}}. Accordingly, those terms are avoided in this article.}} while his wife designed the other (the Indian side) and converted both into relief models. Meeker pestered Laura Fraser to complete the modeling, as he wanted the half dollars available for sale at an upcoming event. She completed the work by July 30, 1926, when she wrote to enquire where she should send the designs for endorsement by the [[Commission of Fine Arts]].  This body since 1921 had been tasked with advising the Secretary of the Treasury on coinage design.  She sent photographs of her models to the commission's offices.  On August 5, 1926, commission chairman [[Charles Moore (Commission of Fine Arts)|Charles Moore]] responded enthusiastically, informing her that not only had the commission endorsed the designs, but they were having the prints framed for their meeting room.{{sfn|Taxay|pp=118, 122}}  To save time, the hubs from which coinage dies could be prepared were made by the [[Medallic Art Company]] of New York, which had made reductions from plaster models to hubs for several commemorative issues.  The resulting hubs were sent to the [[Philadelphia Mint]], where working dies for the issue were made.{{sfn|Bowers|p=88}}{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=182}}  A [[compass rose]] on the Indian side, included in Laura Fraser's models, does not appear on the issued coin, though the reason for the change is not known.{{sfn|Taxay|p=122}}

One side of the half dollar  depicts a [[Conestoga wagon]] drawn by two oxen, heading into an extremely large setting sun, with resplendent rays.  The designers<U+2019> initials appear behind the wagon; five stars appear below the vehicle, though what they represent is uncertain.  Swiatek and Breen suggested that they represent five states and territories through which pioneers would have passed.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=181}}{{sfn|Vermeule|p=173}} The Indian side features a dramatically rendered Native American, standing erect with outstretched arm in an intended gesture of peace.{{sfn|Vermeule|p=173}} Swiatek and Breen noted that the Indian's "position has been irreverently compared to that of a traffic policeman demanding 'Halt!'&nbsp;"{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=181}}  Such comparisons are to be found even in Meeker's 1928 obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'', which averred that the Indian was "standing with hands upraised to stop the white man's progress westward".{{sfn|''New York Times''|1928-12-04}} The Native American wears a headdress, has a blanket and bow, and is superimposed on a map of the United States, with a line of Conestoga wagons heading West. The design is carried to the rim of the coin; [[Hudson Bay]] is visible in the upper right.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=181}}{{sfn|Bowers|p=88}}{{sfn|Vermeule|p=173}}

The Frasers' design for the half dollar has been widely admired.  Swiatek and Breen deemed the issue "one of the greatest artistic triumphs ever to be released by the Mint".{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=182}}  Numismatic historian [[Don Taxay]] called the coin "the most beautiful as well as the most truly 'American' U.S. coin.  It testifies to the fact that authentic genius, even when trammeled by the necessities of a modern, mechanical mint, can transform our coinage into a work of art."{{sfn|Taxay|p=122}}

== Initial release ==

According to Webber, "during the final stages of manufacture, [Meeker] kept heckling the mint to 'hurry up'&nbsp;".{{sfn|Webber|p=22}}  The [[Philadelphia Mint]] struck 48,000 pieces in September 1926, plus 30 reserved for inspection by the 1927 [[United States Assay Commission]].  They sold quite well; Meeker peddled them along his route at $1 each.  The difference between the face value and the sale price was to pay the cost for historical markers along the Trail, and to renovate the [[Whitman Mission National Historic Site|Whitman Mission]] in Washington state.  The 1926 piece was later dubbed by the Association the "Ezra Meeker Issue".{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|pp=182<U+2013>183}}{{sfn|''New York Times''|1928-08-04}}

With the initial quantity sold out (75 pieces were returned to the mint, most likely because they were damaged or misstruck), the Association requested that more pieces be produced.  A hundred thousand were coined at the [[San Francisco Mint]] in October and November, bearing the [[mint mark]] S (1926-S).{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 55}}  The Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar thus became the first commemorative coin struck at multiple mints; Bowers notes that this set "a precedent which would be expanded and abused in the years to come".{{sfn|Bowers|p=89}} According to Swiatek and Breen, "the Association&nbsp;... [was] expecting that the collectors who bought 1926 Philadelphia coins would turn out in similar or greater numbers for the second variety".{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=182}}  Although a few thousand quickly sold, the market for the half dollars proved saturated, and tens of thousands remained at the mint pending payment.{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 55}}{{sfn|Bowers|p=89}}  On December 29, 1926, Meeker celebrated his 96th birthday in New York; he was presented with 96 Oregon Trail Memorial half dollars by the Association.{{sfn|''New York Times''|1927-12-30}}

Despite the many unsold 1926-S half dollars still in the government's hands, the Association sought the issuance of 1927-dated half dollars; this was refused by the Treasury Department (of which the Bureau of the Mint was a part) due to the backlog.{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 55}}  In 1928, however, 50,000 more were struck at the Philadelphia Mint.  The Treasury refused to release these coins until all of the 1926-S pieces were paid for.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=182}}  This did not hinder Meeker's exploits: he was presented with 97 coins on his birthday in December 1927 by the Association{{sfn|''New York Times''|1927-12-30}} and brought his half dollars to the visitor's gallery of the [[New York Stock Exchange]], though he was refused permission to go onto the floor.{{sfn|''Morning Leader''}} He began another transcontinental journey in August 1928 from [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], this one by a motorized wagon provided by the [[Ford Motor Company]], selling half dollars along the way.{{sfn|Webber|p=22}}{{sfn|''New York Times''|1928-08-04}} Meeker was forced to break off the journey due to illness in Detroit, almost dying there.  He was able to return home, disgruntled at having missed voting in the election (he supported the successful Republican candidate, [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]], for president) for the first time since 1853.  At his home in Washington state, Meeker again became ill in November, and died December 3, 1928, three and a half weeks before his 98th birthday.{{sfn|''New York Times''|1928-12-04}}{{sfn|''New York Times''|1928-08-04}}  He was buried in a cemetery in his adopted home town of Puyallup.  Meeker's headstone bears a plaque reproducing the wagon side of the half dollar.{{sfn|Webber|p=49}}

==  Reissue ==

In the years following Meeker's death, the Association continued its efforts to sell the 1926-dated half dollars.  It was able to persuade President Hoover to proclaim the Covered Wagon Centennial in 1930, the hundredth anniversary both of Meeker's birth and of the first wagon train leaving St. Louis for the [[Oregon country]]. One means of selling coins the Association devised was a campus-wide drive at [[Yale University]], alma mater of Lorne W. Buckley (executive director of the Association), in October 1930 to raise money for Trail markers.  More than 600 coins were sold.{{sfn|Webber|pp=29, 35<U+2013>37, 42}}

All 1928 Oregon Trail Memorial half dollars remained in the hands of the Treasury in the years after their striking, causing interest in the coin collecting community<U+2014>several letters to the editor appeared in ''[[The Numismatist]]'', enquiring as to the coins' fate.  Early in 1933, the Treasury melted 17,000 of the 1926-S pieces.  This allowed the 1928 coins to be sold, and the Association found itself with a small quantity of the 1926 pieces, several thousand of the 1926-S, and the entire mintage from 1928 to sell.  However, the Association was not able to sell many of the 1928 pieces.{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 55}}{{sfn|Bowers|p=89}}  The Association marketed the 1928 coins as the "[[Jedediah Smith]] Issue".{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=78}}

The Association turned to the [[John Walter Scott|Scott Stamp and Coin Company]] of New York.  Scott was able to sell some of the 1928 half dollars. Scott's representative, Wayte Raymond, proposed melting all but 6,000 of the 1928 coins in order to create an artificial scarcity, and this was done.  According to Bowers, the company "desired to capitalize on the gullibility of collectors and their need to complete sets by having more varieties coined. Scott figured that if additional Oregon Trail half dollars could be minted with the date 1933 they could be sold effectively at the [[Century of Progress Exposition]] held that year in Chicago."{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 55}}  Swiatek and Breen noted, "through God only knows what manner of political manipulation, the Oregon Trail Memorial Association managed to obtain approval of a new 1933 Denver issue" for sale at the exposition.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p =182}}  The 1933-D coins were the first commemorative coins ever struck at the [[Denver Mint]].{{sfn|Yeoman|p=287}}  A total of 5,250 of the 1933-D were struck, of which approximately five were reserved for the Assay Commission and 242 were eventually returned for melting.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|pp=182<U+2013>183}}  Bowers believes that the returned pieces were likely defective, rather than unsold.{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 55}} The Association dubbed the 1933-D the "Century of Progress Exposition Issue"; both the 1928 and the 1933-D half dollars were sold for $2 each.{{sfn|Slabaugh|pp=77<U+2013>78}}  However, the 1928 could be obtained for $1.75 by anyone who had recently bought two or more of the 1926 issues, and could be purchased for as low as $1.10 each by purchasing 10 of the 1926-dated coins.{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 59}}  With the relative success of the 1933-D issue, the Association ordered 7,000 more in 1934, also struck at Denver.  These were dubbed the "[[Fort Hall]], [[Fort Laramie]] and [[Jason Lee (missionary)|Jason Lee]] Issue" and were also sold by Scott, for $2.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=183}}  In a 1937 monograph quoted by Bowers, early coin dealer B. Max Mehl speculated that it took Scott two years to dispose of the 1934-D pieces, as no further Oregon Trail commemoratives were struck until 1936.{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 56}}

== Final issues, termination and aftermath ==

Beginning in 1934, organizations and individuals saw small-mintage commemoratives, struck at multiple mints over the course of years, as an opportunity for profit.{{sfn|Bowers|p=12}}  Congress authorized several issues in 1934, including the Texas Centennial half dollar, meant to honor the centennial of [[Texas Independence]] in 1936, but struck from 1934 to 1938 at all three mints.  More new commemoratives followed in 1935, and over 20 in 1936.  These issues included the Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar, issued to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Cincinnati as a center of music, although nothing out of the ordinary is known to have taken place in that city's musical life in 1886.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=12<U+2013>13}}

Numismatist Arlie R. Slabaugh, in his volume on US commemorative coins, discussed the marketing practices of the 1930s:

{{quote
| Added to the abuse of reissues was the manner of selling these [the Oregon Trail pieces] and several other later issues of commemoratives.  The price was often higher than the dollar per coin usually asked in the past, although most of the commemorative deluge came during the depression years.  A few pieces at a higher price would not have been too bad, but on a large number of types, the cost to collectors added up.  Then, too, many issues were sold only in sets.  Coinage was generally small and sold out in only a few days.  Speculation was rife<U+2014>original cost was low to what it might be a short time later if you unfortunately missed having your order filled&nbsp;... collectors who had not managed to obtain single specimens from the original source were forced to buy it at higher and higher prices from speculators<U+2014>it soon became a regular round robin of higher and higher prices.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=78}}

Senator [[Francis T. Maloney]]: "Is there any limitation of time on these issues?"

The Association sought more pieces in 1936; 10,000 were struck at Philadelphia and 5,000 at San Francisco, plus in each case six pieces for assay.  Some of the 1936 and 1936-S pieces were sold by Scott, others by the Association through a New York City mail drop, in either case at an initial price of $1.60 per half dollar.{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 55}}  These were dubbed the "Whitman Centennial Issue", or the "Whitman Mission" Issue.  Residents of [[Walla Walla, Washington]] had sought a separate commemorative to celebrate the centennial of the arrival of missionary [[Marcus Whitman]] and his wife in the [[Walla Walla River|Walla Walla Valley]].  Although this bill was defeated, a local group made a deal with the Association to sell some of the 1936-S Oregon Trail pieces in [[eastern Washington]] for $2 and by mail for $2.18.{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 56}}   Most of the 1936 pieces struck at Philadelphia were sold by the means of a mailing to Scott's customer list.{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 60}} Some portion of each of the issues between 1933 and 1937 were reserved for sale by patriotic organizations.{{sfn|Slabaugh|pp=78<U+2013>79}}

The 1937 issue was distributed only by the Association as the deal with Scott had been ended.  A total of 12,000 pieces (plus eight for the Assay Commission) were struck at Denver, and were sold at $1.60.  No special name was given to the issue. Many of the coins dated 1936 and 1937 were bought up by speculators on the first day of sale, shutting out the individual collector.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|pp=182<U+2013>183}}  Coin dealer Mehl wondered in 1937, "the 1936 Philadelphia Mint coin is now retailing at $5 and the San Francisco Mint at $10. Where will this thing stop? I don't know."{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 56}}

The 1938 coins, again without a special name, were struck at all three mints, the first time that had been done for the Oregon Trail coins in one year.  Six thousand (plus pieces for the Assay Commission) were struck at each mint, and the issue was sold in sets of three, for $6.25.  The same practice was followed in 1939, but the price was raised to $7.50 a set and the mintage reduced to 3,000 coins, plus the assay pieces.  These sets were also bought up by speculators, and individual collectors often had to pay double or triple the issue price to secure a set.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|pp=182<U+2013>183}}  Collectors sent letters of protest to congressmen and to the Treasury Department.{{sfn|Webber|p=24}} On August 5, 1939, Congress acted, passing legislation that put an end to all commemorative issues authorized before March 1939.  Swiatek and Breen observed that if Congress had not intervened, "there would probably be Oregon Trail coins dated 1980".{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|pp=182<U+2013>183}}

A total of 264,419 Oregon Trail Memorial half dollars were struck, of which approximately 174 were intended for the Assay Commission, and 61,317 were melted.  Accordingly, a total of 202,928 were issued to the public.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=183}}  The Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar was the commemorative coin struck for the longest period.{{sfn|Bowers|p=87}}  According to [[R.S. Yeoman]]'s 2012 edition of ''[[A Guide Book of United States Coins]]'', the cheapest Oregon Trail coins are the 1926 and 1926-S at $135 in Almost Uncirculated.  The 1939 pieces are listed only as a set and in [[Mint state|Mint State]] conditions (uncirculated), beginning at $1,600.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=287}}

No commemorative coins were struck between 1939 and 1945.  When authorizations resumed after the war, issues in honor of [[Booker T. Washington]] and [[George Washington Carver]] were sold, in some years, in low-mintage sets of coins from all three mints.  After 1954, when the last such pieces were struck, the Treasury Department did not again support a non-circulating commemorative until 1982, when a half dollar in honor of the 250th anniversary of the birth of [[George Washington]] was issued.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=14<U+2013>15}}  The Washington half dollar was distributed by the Mint, with profits applied to the reduction of [[United States national debt|the national debt]].{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 180}}  Bowers writes, "this time around[, striking of commemorative coins] would not be on behalf of private or local interests".{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 179}}

Bowers states that the Oregon Trail coins "are beautiful, but circumstances surrounding their issuance leave much to be desired".{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 54}} Slabaugh noted that "Artistically, this is my favorite commemorative coin.  But from an ethical standpoint, it is not."{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=78}} Swiatek and Breen wrote that the Association's "activities in exploiting coin collectors and the general public eventually led to the unpopularity of commemoratives in Congress and ultimately to adamant Treasury Department opposition to any further commemorative issues, no matter how worthy the cause to be memorialized, no matter who represented the sponsoring commissions".{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=182}}  According to Bowers, "as far as I know, the financial benefits which provided the reason for issuing the half dollars, 'to rescue the various important points along the old trail from oblivion,' to erect 'suitable monuments, memorial and otherwise,' etc., never came to pass, at least not from money provided by the sale of the coins."{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 57}}

A small number of coins from each year and mint were put aside for inspection by the following year's [[United States Assay Commission|Assay Commission]], the above figures include such pieces.  This accounts for the variance from the even thousand mintages in 1933 and after.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=183}}
