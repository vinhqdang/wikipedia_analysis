[[Image:csv_delimited000.svg|thumb|right|200px|A stylistic depiction of a fragment from a [[Comma-separated values|CSV]]-formatted text file. The commas (shown in red) are used as field delimiters.]]

A '''delimiter''' is a sequence of one or more [[character (computing)|character]]s used to specify the boundary between separate, independent regions in [[plain text]] or other data stream.<ref>[http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-011/_1544.htm Federal Standard 1037C ''delimiter'']</ref> An example of a delimiter is the comma character in a sequence of [[comma-separated values]].

An alternative to the use of field delimiters is [[String_literal#Declarative_notation|declarative notation]], which uses a length field at the start of a region to specify the boundary. For word delimiters used in the written form of human languages, see [[interword separation]].

== Overview ==
Delimiters can be broken down into:

* Field and Record delimiters
* Bracket delimiters

==Field and record delimiters==
Field delimiters are used to separate data fields. Record delimiters separate groups of fields.<ref name="FldDelm">{{cite book | last = de Moor | first = Georges J. | title = Progress in Standardization in Health Care Informatics | publisher =IOS Press | year = 1993 | id =ISBN 9051991142}} p. 141</ref>

For example, the (CSV) file format uses a [[comma]] as the delimiter between [[field (computer science)|fields]], and a [[end-of-line]] indicator as the delimiter between [[Row (database)|records]].  For instance:
<source lang="perl">    fname,lname,age,salary
nancy,davolio,33,$30000
erin,borakova,28,$25250
tony,raphael,35,$28700
</source>
specifies a simple [[flat file database]] [[table (information)|table]] using the (CSV) file format.

==Conventions==

Computing platforms historically use certain delimiters by convention.<ref>

==Delimiter collision==<!-- This section is linked from [[String literal]] -->
'''Delimiter collision''' is a problem that occurs when an author or programmer introduces delimiters into text without actually intending them to be interpreted as boundaries between separate regions.<ref name="FldDelm"/> In the case of [[Comma-separated values]] files, for example, this can occur whenever an author attempts to include a comma as part of a field value (e.g., salary = "$30,000").

===Solutions===

Because delimiter collision is a very common problem, methods for avoiding it have been invented.

====Escape character====
One method for avoiding delimiter collision is to use [[escape character]]s. From a language design standpoint, these are adequate, but they have drawbacks:

* text can be rendered unreadable when littered with numerous escape characters;
* they require a mechanism to 'escape the escapes' when not intended as escape characters; and
* although easy to type, they can be cryptic to someone unfamiliar with the language.<ref name="Kahrel000">{{cite book 
        | title     = Automating InDesign with Regular Expressions
        | first     = Peter
        | last      = Kahrel

        | id        = ISBN 0596529376
        }}p. 11</ref>

====Escape sequence====
Escape sequences are similar to escape characters, except they usually consist of some kind of mnemonic instead of just a single character.  One use is in [[string literal]]s that include a doublequote (") character. For example in [[Perl]], the code:
    print "Nancy said \x34Hello World!\x34 to the crowd.";  ### use \x34

produces the same output as:     
    print "Nancy said \"Hello World!\" to the crowd.";      ### use escape char

One drawback of escape sequences, when used by people, is the need to memorize the codes that represent individual characters (see also: [[character entity reference]], [[numeric character reference]]).    

====Dual quoting delimiters====
In contrast to escape sequences and escape characters, dual delimiters
provide yet another way to avoid delimiter collision. Some languages, for example, allow the use of either a singlequote (') or a doublequote (") to specify a string literal. For example in [[Perl]]:

    print 'Nancy said "Hello World!" to the crowd.';
    
produces the desired output without requiring escapes. This approach, however, only works when the string does not contain ''both'' types of quotation marks.

====Multiple quoting delimiters====
In contrast to dual delimiters, multiple delimiters are even more flexible for avoiding delimiter collision.<ref name="ProgPerl001">Wall, ''infra'' p. 63</ref> 

For example in [[Perl]]:
    print qq^Nancy doesn't want to say "Hello World!" anymore.^;

    print qq@Nancy doesn't want to say "Hello World!" anymore.@;

    print qq<U+00A7>Nancy doesn't want to say "Hello World!" anymore.<U+00A7>;        

all produce the desired output through use of the '''quotelike operator''', which allows characters to act as delimiters. Although this method is more flexible, few languages support it. [[Perl]] and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] are two that do.<ref name="Ruby000">{{cite book 
| last      = Yukihiro
| first     = Matsumoto
| title     = Ruby in a Nutshell 
| publisher = O'Reilly
| year      = 2001
| id        = 0596002149
}} In Ruby, these are indicated as ''general delimited strings''. p. 11</ref><ref name="ProgPerl002">Wall, ''infra'' p. 63</ref>

====Content boundary ====
A '''content boundary''' is a special type of delimiter that is specifically designed to resist delimiter collision. It works by allowing the author to specify a long sequence of characters that is guaranteed to always indicate a boundary between parts in a multi-part message, with no other possible interpretation.<ref name="Mime000">{{cite book 
| last      = Javvin Technologies
| first     = Incorporated
| title     = Network Protocols Handbook
| publisher = Javvin Technologies Inc.
| year      = 2005
| id        = 0974094528
}} p. 26 </ref>

This is usually done by specifying a random sequence of characters followed by an identifying mark such as a [[UUID]], a [[timestamp]], or some other distinguishing mark. (''See e.g.'', [[MIME#Multipart Messages|MIME]], [[Here_document|Here documents]]).

==== Regular expression syntax ====
:{{seealso|Regular expression examples}}

In specifying a [[regular expression]], alternate delimiters may also be used to simplify the syntax for '''match''' and '''substitution''' operations in [[Perl]].<ref name="Friedl000">Friedl ''infra''.</ref>

For example, a simple match operation may be specified in perl with the following syntax: 

    $string1 = 'Nancy said "Hello World!" to the crowd.';    # specify a target string
    print $string1 =~ m/[aeiou]+/;                           # match one or more vowels

The syntax is flexible enough to specify match operations with alternate delimiters, making it easy to avoid delimiter collision:

    $string1 = 'Nancy said "httq://Hello/World.htm" is not a valid address.'; # target string
    
    print $string1 =~ m@httq://@;       # match using alternate regular expression delimiter
    print $string1 =~ m{httq://};       # same as previous, but different delimiter
    print $string1 =~ m!httq://!;       # same as previous, but different delimiter

==ASCII armor==
Although principally used as a mechanism for text encoding of binary data,
"[[ASCII armor]]ing" is a programming and systems administration technique 
that also helps to avoid delimiter collision in some circumstances.<ref name="Rhee000">{{cite book

        | id        = 1584503475
        }}(an example usage of ASCII armoring in encryption applications)</ref> This technique is contrasted from the other approaches described above because it is more complicated, and therefore not suitable for small applications and simple data storage formats. The technique employs a special encoding scheme or [[hash function]], such as [[base64]], to ensure that delimiter characters do not appear in transmitted data.

This technique is used, for example, in [[Microsoft]]'s [[ASP.NET]] web development technology, and is closely associated with the "VIEWSTATE" component of that system.<ref name="Kalani000">{{cite book
| title     = Developing and Implementing Web Applications with Visual C# . NET and Visual Studio . NET

| id        = ISBN 0789729016
}}(describes the use of Base64 encoding and VIEWSTATE inside HTML source code)</ref>

=== Example ===
The following is a simplified example demonstrating how this technique works in practice. 

The first code fragment shows a simple HTML tag in which the VIEWSTATE value contains characters that are incompatible with the delimiters of the HTML tag itself:
<source lang="xml">
    <input type="hidden" __VIEWSTATE="BookTitle:Nancy doesn't say "Hello World!" anymore." />
</source>

This first code fragment is not [[Well-formed element|well-formed]], and would therefore not work properly in a "real world" deployed system.

In contrast, the second code fragment shows a similar HTML tag, except this time incompatible characters in the VIEWSTATE value are removed through the application of base64 encoding:
<source lang="xml">
    <input type="hidden" __VIEWSTATE="TmFtZTpMYXJyeSAiQnVkIiBNZWxtYW47" />
</source>
This prevents delimiter collision and ensures that incompatible characters will not appear inside the HTML code, regardless of what characters appear in the original (decoded) text.<ref name="Kalani000" />
