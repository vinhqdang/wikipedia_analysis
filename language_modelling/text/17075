{{Cannon}}

A '''cannon''' is a type of [[artillery]], usually large and [[Cylinder (geometry)|tubular]], that uses [[gunpowder]] or other explosive-based [[propellant]]s to launch a [[projectile]] over a distance. Cannon vary in [[caliber]], [[Range of a projectile|range]], [[wiktionary:mobility|mobility]], [[rate of fire]], [[indirect fire|angle of fire]], and [[fire power|firepower]]; different forms of cannon combine and balance these attributes in varying degrees, depending on their intended use on the battlefield. The word ''cannon'' is derived from several languages, in which the original definition can usually be translated as ''tube'', ''cane'', or ''reed''.

[[Technology of the Song Dynasty#Gunpowder warfare|First used]] in [[China]], cannon were among the earliest forms of gunpowder [[artillery]], and over time replaced [[siege engine]]s&mdash;among other weapons&mdash;on the battlefield. The [[Cannon in the Middle Ages#Spread to Europe|first cannon in Europe]] were probably used in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], during the [[Islam]]ic wars against [[Spain]], in the 13th century; their use was first documented in the [[Middle East]] around this time, as well. [[English cannon]] were first used during the [[Hundred Years' War]], at the [[Battle of Cr<U+00E9>cy]], in 1346. It was during this period, the [[Middle Ages]], that cannon became standardized, and more effective in both the anti-infantry and [[siege]] roles. After the Middle Ages, most large cannon were abandoned, in favor of greater numbers of lighter, more maneuverable pieces. In addition, new technologies and tactics were developed, making most defenses obsolete; this led to the construction of [[star fort]]s, specifically designed to withstand bombardment from artillery. 

Cannon also transformed [[naval warfare]]: the [[Royal Navy]], in particular, took advantage of their firepower. As [[rifling]] became more commonplace, the accuracy of cannon was significantly improved, and they became deadlier than ever, as evidenced in [[World War I]], where a considerable majority of all deaths were caused by cannon. [[World War II]] also saw cannon play a major part: they were used in land, air, and sea engagements, in both the [[European Theater of Operations|European]] and [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific]] Theaters of Operations, as well as the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. Most modern cannon are similar to those used in World War II, including [[autocannon]], but with the exception of naval guns, which are now significantly smaller in caliber.

==Etymology and terminology==
''Cannon'' is derived from the Old Italian word ''cannone'', meaning ''large tube'', which came from the [[Latin]] ''canna'', in turn originating from the ''kanna'',&mdash;[[Greek language|Greek]] for ''cane'', or ''reed''&mdash;and ultimately deriving from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] term ''qanu'', meaning ''tube'' or ''reed''.<ref name="Definition and etymology of cannon">{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Cannon|title=Definition and etymology of "cannon"|publisher=[[Webster's Dictionary]]|accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cane|title=Etymology of "Cane"|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2008-01-24}}</ref><ref name="Definition and etymology of cane">{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cane|title=Definition and etymology of "cane"|publisher=[[Webster's Dictionary]]|accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref> The word has been used to refer to a gun since 1326 in Italy, and 1418 in England.

The first metal cannon was the ''[[pot-de-fer]]''.

By the 1500s, cannon were made in a great variety of lengths and bore diameters, but the general rule was that the longer the barrel, the longer the range.

The end of the Middle Ages saw the construction of larger, more powerful cannon, as well their spread throughout the world. As they were not effective at breaching the newer fortifications resulting from the development of cannon, [[siege engine]]s, such as [[siege tower]]s and [[trebuchet]]s, became less widely used. However, wooden "battery-towers" took on a similar role as siege towers in the [[gunpowder]] age&mdash;such as that used at [[Siege of Kazan (1552)|siege of Kazan]] in 1552, which could hold ten large-caliber cannon, in addition to 50 lighter cannon.<ref name="Kazan">{{cite book|last=Nossov|first=Konstantin|page=pp. 53<U+2013>55|title=Russian Fortresses, 1480<U+2013>1682|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]]|year=2006|isbn=1-84176-916-9}}</ref> Another notable effect of cannon on warfare during this period was the change in conventional fortifications.

Wheeled gun carriages and [[trunnion]]s became common, and the invention of the [[limber]] further facilitated the transportation of artillery.<ref name="Manucy, p. 5">Manucy, p. 5.</ref> As a result, [[field artillery]] became viable, and began to emerge, often used alongside the larger cannon intended for sieges.<ref name="Sadler">{{cite book|title=Flodden 1513: Scotland's Greatest Defeat|last=Sadler|first=John|isbn=9781841769592|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]]|year=2006|page=pp. 22<U+2013>23|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZXX1SrxKTg0C&printsec=frontcover#PPA23,M1}}</ref><ref name="Manucy, p. 5"/> The better gunpowder, improved, cast-iron projectiles, and the standardization of calibers meant that even small-caliber cannon could be deadly.<ref name="Manucy, p. 5"/> In ''[[The Art of War (Machiavelli)|The Art of War]]'', [[Niccol<U+00F2> Machiavelli]] observed that "It is true that the [[arquebus]]es and the small artillery do much more harm than the heavy artillery."<ref name="The Art of War (Machiavelli)">{{cite book|first=Niccol<U+00F2>|last=Machiavelli|title=The Art of War|isbn=0226500462|page=p. 74|authorlinks=Niccol<U+00F2> Machiavelli}}</ref> This was the case at [[Battle of Flodden Field|Flodden]], in 1513: the English [[field gun]]s outpaced the Scottish siege artillery, firing twice, or even thrice, as many rounds.<ref>Sadler, p. 60.</ref> Despite the increased maneuverability, however, cannon were still much slower than the rest of the army: a heavy English cannon required 23 horses to transport, while a [[culverin]], nine, yet, even with this many animals transporting them, they still moved at a walking pace. Due to their relatively slow speed, and lack of organization, discipline, and tactics, the combination of [[pike and shot]] still dominated the battlefields of Europe.<ref>Manucy, p. 6.</ref> 

Innovations continued, notably the German invention of the [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]], a thick-walled, short-barreled gun that blasted shot upward at a steep angle. Mortars were useful for sieges, as they could fire over walls and other defenses.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9053839/mortar|title=Encyclopedia Britannica Online - Mortar|accessdate=13 March|accessyear=2008}}</ref> This cannon found more use with the Dutch, who learned to shoot bombs filled with powder from them. However, setting the bomb fuse in the mortar was a problem. "Single firing" was the first technique used to set the fuse, where the bomb was placed with the fuse down against the propelling charge. This practice often resulted in the fuse being blown into the bomb, causing it to blow up in front of the mortar. Because of this danger, "double firing" was developed, where the fuse was turned up and the gunner lighted the fuse and the touch hole simultaneously. This, however, required much skill and timing, and was especially dangerous when the gun failed to fire, leaving a lighted bomb in the barrel. Not until 1650 was it accidentally discovered that double-lighting was a superfluous process: the heat of firing was enough to light the fuse.<ref>Tunis, p. 90.</ref>

[[Gustavus Adolphus]] emphasized the use of light cannon and mobility in his army, and created new formations and tactics that revolutionized artillery. He discontinued using all 12&nbsp;pounder&mdash;or heavier&mdash;cannon as field artillery, preferring, instead, to use cannon that could be manned by only a few men. One gun, called the "leatheren," could be serviced by only two persons, but was abandoned, replaced by 4&nbsp;pounder and 9&nbsp;pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. These could be operated by three men, and pulled by only two horses. Also, Adolphus's army was the first to use a special cartridge that contained both powder and shot, which sped up loading, and therefore increased the rate of fire.<ref>Manucy, pp. 7<U+2013>8.</ref> Additionally, he pioneered the use of [[canister shot]] against infantry, which was essentially a can, filled with musket balls.<ref>Tunis, p. 96.</ref> At the time, for each thousand infantrymen, there was one cannon on the battlefield; Gustavus Adolphus increased the number of cannon in his army so dramatically, that there were six cannon for each one thousand infantry. Each regiment was assigned two pieces, though he often decided to arrange his artillery into [[Artillery battery|batteries]], instead. These were to decimate the enemy infantry, while his cavalry [[flanking|outflanked]] the enemy heavy guns.<ref>Manucy, p. 8.</ref> At the [[Battle of Breitenfeld (1631)|Battle of Breitenfeld]], in 1631, Adolphus proved the effectiveness of the changes made to his army, in particular his artillery, by defeating [[Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly]]. Although severely outnumbered, the Swedes were able to fire between three and five times as many volleys of artillery without losing ground, due to their infantry's [[line (formation)|linear]] formations. Battered by cannon fire, and low on morale, Tilly's men broke rank, and fled.<ref>{{cite book|first=Archer|last=Jones|title=The Art of War in the Western World|location=[[New York City]]||publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|year=2001|isbn=0252069668|page=p. 235|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=z2FRzcz2W0oC&printsec=frontcover#PPA235,M1}}</ref>
[[Image:Gabions.png|thumb|The use of [[gabions]] with cannon was an important part in the attack and defense of fortifications.]]
Around this time also came the idea of aiming the cannon to hit a target. Gunners controlled the range of their cannon by measuring the angle of elevation with a "gunner's [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]." Cannon did not have [[Sight (device)|sights]], and even with measuring tools, aiming was still largely guesswork.<ref>Tunis, p. 97.</ref>

In the latter half of the 17th century, the French engineer [[Vauban]] introduced a more systematic and scientific approach to attacking gunpowder fortresses, in a time when many field commanders "were notorious dunces in siegecraft."<ref name="Griffith">{{cite book|last=Griffith|first=Paddy|title=The Vauban Fortifications of France|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eH1NtNGWQZ8C&printsec=frontcover|year=2006|page=5|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]]|isbn=9781841768755}}</ref> Careful [[sapping]] forward, supported by [[enfilading]] [[ricochet fire]], was a key feature of this system, and it even allowed Vauban to calculate the length of time a siege would take.<ref name="Griffith"/> He was also a prolific builder of star forts, and did much to popularize the idea of "depth defense" in the face of cannon.<ref>Griffith, p 29</ref> These principles were followed into the mid-19th century, when changes in armaments necessitated greater depth defense than Vauban had provided for. It was only in the years prior to [[World War I]] that new works began to break radically away from his designs.<ref>Griffith, pp. 56-57.</ref>

The [[United States Navy]] tested guns by measuring them, firing them two or three times,&mdash;termed "proof by powder"&mdash;and using pressurized water to detect leaks.<ref name="NavyBarbaryI">{{cite book|last=Knox|first=Dudley W.|title=Naval Documents related to the United Stats Wars with the Barbary Powers, Volume I|year=1939|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]}}</ref>

The [[carronade]] was adopted by the Royal Navy in 1779; the lower muzzle velocity of the [[round shot]] when fired from this cannon was intended to create more wooden [[wikt:splinter|splinters]] when hitting the structure of an enemy vessel, as they were believed to be deadly.<ref name="Carronade">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dS4yZLvS0soC&printsec=frontcover#PPA83,M1|title=Siege Train: The Journal of a Confederate Artilleryman in the Defense of Charleston|year=1996|publisher=[[University of South Carolina Press]]|location=[[Charleston, South Carolina]]|last=Manigault|first=Edward|coauthors=Warren Ripley|page=p. 83|isbn=1570031274}}</ref> The carronade was much shorter, and weighed between a third to a quarter less than an equivalent [[long gun]]; for example, a 32&nbsp;pounder carronade weighed less than a [[ton]], compared with a 32&nbsp;pounder long gun, which weighed over 3&nbsp;tons. The guns were, therefore, easier to handle, and also required less than half as much gunpowder as long guns mounted on naval garrison carriages, allowing fewer men to crew them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hms.org.uk/nelsonsnavycarronade.htm|title=The Historical Maritime Society|accessdate=2008-02-16|publisher=The Historical Maritime Society|year=2001}}</ref> Carronades were manufactured in the usual naval gun [[caliber]]s,<ref>12, 18, 24, 32, and 42&nbsp;[[pound (weight)#Imperial_pound|pounders]], but 6&nbsp;pounder and 68&nbsp;pounder versions are known.</ref> but were not counted in a [[ship of the line]]'s rated number of guns. As a result, the classification of Royal Navy vessels in this period can be misleading, as they often carried more cannon than were listed.

The [[Great Turkish Bombard]]s of the [[Fall of Constantinople|Siege of Constantinople]], after being on display for four centuries, were used to battle a British fleet in 1807, in the [[Dardanelles Operation]]. The artillery hit a British ship with two {{convert|700|lb|kg|abbr=on}} cannonballs, killing 60 sailors; in total, the cannon claimed over 100 lives, prompting the British to retreat.

The practice of [[rifling]]&mdash;casting spiraling lines inside the cannon's barrel&mdash;was applied to artillery more frequently by 1855, as it gave cannon [[Gyroscope|gyroscopic]] stability, which improved their accuracy.

The superior cannon of the [[Western world]] brought them tremendous advantages in warfare.

===20th and 21st centuries===
Cannon in the 20th and 21st centuries are usually divided into sub-categories, and given separate names. Some of the most widely used types of modern cannon are [[howitzer]]s, [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s, [[gun]]s, and [[autocannon]], although a few [[supergun]]s&mdash;extremely large, custom-designed cannon&mdash;have also been constructed. Modern artillery is used in a variety of roles, depending on its type. According to [[NATO]], the general role of artillery is to provide fire support, which is defined as "the application of fire, coordinated with the maneuver of forces to destroy, neutralize, or suppress the enemy."<ref>{{cite book|title=AAP-6 NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions|year=2007|publisher=[[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]]|accessdate=2008-03-21|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/stanag/aap006/aap-6-2007.pdf|format=PDF|page=p. 113}}</ref>

When referring to cannon, the term ''gun'' is often used incorrectly. In military usage, a gun is a cannon with a high muzzle velocity and [[direct fire|comparatively flat trajectory]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Gun|title=Definition of "Gun"|accessdate=2008-03-17|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]]}}</ref> as opposed to other types of artillery, such as howitzers or mortars, which have lower muzzle velocities, and usually fire [[indirect fire|indirectly]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Howitzer|title=Definition of "Howitzer"|accessdate=2008-03-17|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Mortar|title=Definition of "Mortar"|accessdate=2008-03-17|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]]}}</ref>

By the early 20th century, [[infantry weapon]]s became more powerful and accurate, forcing most artillery away from the front lines. Despite the change to [[indirect fire]], cannon still proved highly effective during [[World War I]], causing over 75% of casualties.<ref>Manucy, p. 20.</ref> The onset of [[trench warfare]] after the first few months of [[World War I]] greatly increased the demand for howitzers, as they fired at a steep angle, and were thus better suited than guns at hitting targets in trenches. Furthermore, their shells carried larger amounts of explosives than those of guns, and caused considerably less barrel wear. The German army took advantage of this, beginning the war with many more howitzers than the French.<ref>{{cite book|first=Bruce I.|last=Gudmundsson|title=On Artillery|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|isbn=0275940470|year=1993|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=O_-0w2WUDd0C&printsec=frontcover#PPP1,M1|page=p. 43}}</ref> World War I also marked the use of the [[Paris Gun]], the longest-ranged gun ever fired.

The [[World War II|Second World War]] sparked new developments in cannon technology.

The tendency to create larger caliber cannon during the World Wars has been reversed in more recent years. The [[United States Army]], for example, sought a lighter, more versatile howitzer, to replace their aging pieces. As it could be towed, the [[M198 howitzer|M198]] was selected to be the successor to the World War II-era cannon used at the time, and entered service in 1979.<ref name="M198 Info">{{cite web|url=http://tech.military.com/equipment/view/146534/m198-155mm-towed-howitzer.html|title=M198 information|accessdate=2008-03-18|publisher=Military.com}}</ref> Still in use today, the M198 is, in turn, being slowly replaced by the [[M777 howitzer|M777]] Ultralightweight howitzer, which weighs nearly half as much, and can be transported by [[helicopter]]&mdash;as opposed to the M198, which requires a [[C-5 Galaxy|C-5]] or [[C-17 Globemaster III|C-17]] to airlift.<ref name="M198 Info"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/soldiertech/0,14632,Soldiertech_M777,,00.html|title=M777 information|accessdate=2008-03-18|publisher=Military.com}}</ref> Although land-based artillery such as the [[M198 howitzer|M198]] are powerful, long-ranged, and accurate, naval guns have not been neglected, despite being much smaller than in the past, and, in some cases, having been replaced by [[cruise missile]]s.<ref name="Cruise missile">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/issues/2001/Mar/Naval_Guns.htm|title=Affordable precision|publisher=National Defense Magazine|accessdate=2008-03-18}}</ref> However, the [[Zumwalt class destroyer]]'s planned armament includes the [[Zumwalt class destroyer#Advanced Gun System (AGS)|Advanced Gun System (AGS)]], a pair of 155&nbsp;mm guns, which fire the [[Long Range Land-Attack Projectile]].

==== Autocannon ====
An [[autocannon]] is a cannon with a larger [[caliber]] than a [[machine gun]], but smaller than that of a [[field gun]]. 20&nbsp;mm has remained the traditional minimum bore for autocannon since World War II, and, since they are the lowest caliber pieces, for all types of cannon. Autocannon have mechanisms to automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have a faster rate of fire than artillery, often approaching&mdash;and, in the case of [[Gatling gun]]s, surpassing&mdash;that of a [[machine gun]].<ref name="Autocannon Rate of Fire"/>
[[Image:GAU-8 in A-10.jpg|thumb|right|135px|The [[GAU-8/A Avenger]] [[autocannon]], mounted in an [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]]]]
Most nations use these rapid-fire cannon on their light vehicles, replacing a more powerful, but heavier, [[tank gun]]. A typical autocannon is the [[25 mm caliber|25&nbsp;mm]] "[[M242 Bushmaster|Bushmaster]]" [[chain gun]], mounted on the [[LAV-25]] and [[M2 Bradley]] [[Infantry fighting vehicle|armored vehicles]].<ref name="Bushmaster"/>

Autocannon have largely replaced machine guns in aircraft, due to their greater firepower.<ref name="Aircraft Cannon"/> The first airborne cannon appeared in [[World War II]], but each airplane could carry only one or two, as cannon are heavier than machine guns, the standard armament. They were variously mounted, often in the wings, but also high on the forward fuselage, where they would fire through the [[propeller]], or even through the propeller hub. Due both to the low number of cannon per aircraft, and the lower rate of fire of cannon, machine guns continued to be used widely early in the war, as there was a greater probability of hitting enemy aircraft.<ref name="Aircraft Cannon"/> However, as cannon were more effective against more heavily armored bomber aircraft, they were eventually integrated into newer fighters, which usually carried between two and four autocannon. The [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404]], [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20&nbsp;mm cannon]], [[MG FF cannon|MG FF]], and their numerous variants became among the most widely used autocannon in the war. Nearly all modern [[fighter aircraft]] are armed with an autocannon, and most are derived from their counterparts from the Second World War.<ref name="Aircraft Cannon"/> The largest, heaviest, and most powerful airborne cannon used by the [[military of the United States]] is the [[GAU-8/A Avenger]] Gatling-type rotary cannon;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.442fw.afrc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123055695|title=GAU-8/A|publisher=442nd Fighter Wing|accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref> it is surpassed only by the specialized artillery pieces carried on the [[AC-130]] gunship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.123exp-warfare.com/t/03804237449/|title=Information on the GAU-8/A|publisher=The Language of Weaponry|accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref>

Although capable of generating a high volume of fire, autocannon are limited by the amount of ammunition that can be carried by the weapons systems mounting them. For this reason, both the 25&nbsp;mm Bushmaster and the 30&nbsp;mm [[RARDEN]] are deliberately designed with relatively slow rates of fire, to extend the amount of time they can be employed on a battlefield before requiring a resupply of ammunition. The rate of fire of modern autocannon ranges from 90 rounds per minute, to 1,800 rounds per minute. Systems with multiple barrels&mdash;Gatling guns&mdash;can have rates of fire of several thousand rounds per minute; the fastest of these is the [[Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-6-30|GSh-6-30K]], which has a rate of fire of over 6,000&nbsp;rounds per minute.<ref name="Autocannon Rate of Fire">{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Anthony G.|page=p. 241|title=Rapid Fire|publisher=Shrewsbury: Airlife Publishing Ltd.|year=2000|isbn=1-84037-435-7}}</ref>

==Operation==
{{main|Cannon operation}}
[[Image:Artillery gun crew-illustration.jpeg|right|thumb|175px|Cannon operation as shown in the 1771 edition of the ''[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]'']]
In the 1770s, cannon operation worked as follows: each cannon would be manned by two gunners, six soldiers, and four officers of artillery. The right gunner was to prime the piece and load it with powder, and the left gunner would fetch the powder from the magazine and be ready to fire the cannon at the officer's command. On each side of the cannon, three soldiers stood, to ram and sponge the cannon, and hold the ladle. The second soldier on the left tasked with providing 50 bullets.<ref name="EB1771">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Britannica|year=1771|publisher=[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica, Inc.]]|location=Edinburgh|chapter=Gunnery}}</ref>

Before loading, the cannon would be cleaned with a wet sponge to extinguish any smoldering material from the last shot. Fresh powder could be set off prematurely by lingering ignition sources. The powder was added, followed by [[wadding]] of paper or hay, and the ball was placed in and rammed down. After ramming the cannon would be aimed with the elevation set using a quadrant and a plummet. At 45 degrees, the ball had the utmost range: about ten times the gun's level range. Any angle above a horizontal line was called random-shot. Wet sponges were used to cool the pieces every ten or twelve rounds.<ref name="EB1771"/>[[Image:Cannoniere 1652.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The parts of a cannon described in John Roberts' ''The Compleat Cannoniere'', London, 1652]]

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], a British gun team consisted of five gunners to aim it, clean the bore with a damp sponge to quench any remaining embers before a fresh charge was introduced, and another to load the gun with a bag of powder and then the projectile. The fourth gunner pressed his thumb on the vent hole, to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge loaded, the fourth would prick the bagged charge through the vent hole, and fill the vent with powder. On command, the fifth gunner would fire the piece with a slowmatch.<ref>{{cite book|last=Holmes|first=Richard|title=Redcoat: the British Soldier in the age of Horse and Musket|year=2002|publisher=[[W.

==In music==
For musical purposes, cannon are generally only used in grand, theatrical pieces, often those with a military theme, due to their impracticality. One of the best known examples of such a piece is [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[1812 Overture]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/works/tchaikov/1812.html |title="1812" Overture in E Flat Major Op. 49 (1880) |author=Dave Lampson |last=Lampson |first=Dave |publisher=Classical Net |accessdate=2008-03-21}}</ref> The overture is properly performed using an artillery section together with the orchestra, resulting in noise levels requiring musicians to wear [[Earplug|ear protection]].<ref name=july4 /> The cannon fire simulates Russian artillery bombardments of the [[Battle of Borodino]], a critical battle in [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia]], whose defeat the piece is celebrating overall.<ref name=july4 /> When the overture was first performed, the cannon were fired by an electric current triggered by the conductor.<ref>{{cite book|accessdate=2008-03-23|title=Tchaikovsky|last=Lee|first=Ernest Markham|date=1906|publisher=G. Bell & sons|location=[[Harvard University]]|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=x60NAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage|page=p. 21}}</ref> However, the overture was not recorded with real cannon fire until [[Mercury Records]] and [[conductor (music)|conductor]] [[Antal Dor<U+00E1>ti]]'s 1958 recording of the [[Minnesota Orchestra]].<ref>{{cite web |author= Flynn, Tony |url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2007/Oct07/Dorati_flynn.htm |title=Antal Dorati - Recording Legend - October 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref> Cannon fire is also frequently used annually in presentations of the ''1812'' on the American  [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], a tradition started by [[Arthur Fiedler]] of the [[Boston Pops]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/works/tchaikov/1812.html |title=Classical Net - Tchaikovsky - 1812 Overture |accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref><ref name=july4>{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Druckenbrod |title=How a rousing Russian tune took over our July 4th |url=http://www.postgazette.com/ae/20030704overtureae3.asp|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=2003-08-04 |accessdate=2008-02-22 }}</ref>

The [[hard rock]] band [[AC/DC]] also used cannon in their song "[[For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)]]."<ref name=acdcsong>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=33:w9fexze5ld6e |title=For Those About to Rock We Salute You |accessdate=2008-02-26 |publisher=[[Allmusic|All Music Guide]]}}</ref> The [[For Those About to Rock We Salute You|album of the same name]] also featured a cannon on its cover.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:06rsa9igb23h~T1 |title=For Those About to Rock We Salute You |accessdate=2008-02-26 |publisher=[[Allmusic|All Music Guide]]}}</ref> In live shows, real cannon were used to perform the piece.<ref name=acdcsong/>

==Restoration==
Cannon recovered from the sea are often extensively damaged from exposure to salt water; because of this, [[Extractive metallurgy|electrolytic reduction treatment]] is required to forestall the process of corrosion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Welss|first=Carmen|title=Rescue Project "Endeavour Cannon"|publisher=[[Foundation for National Parks & Wildlife]]|url=http://fnpw.com.au/enews4/cannon.htm|accessdate=2007-11-14}}</ref> The cannon is then washed in [[purified|deionized]] water to remove the [[electrolyte]], and is treated in [[tannic acid]], which prevents further [[rust]] and gives the metal a bluish-black color.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Canadian Conservation Institute|url=http://www.preservation.gc.ca/gallery/cannon_e.asp|title=Preserving My Heritage - Before & After Gallery - Cannon|accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref><ref name="union"/> After this process, cannon on display may be protected from oxygen and moisture by a [[wax]] sealant. A coat of [[polyurethane]] may also be painted over the wax sealant, to prevent the wax-coated cannon from attracting dust in outdoor displays.<ref name="union">{{cite web|url=http://nautarch.tamu.edu/crl/Report6/union.htm|title=Civil War Union Cannon Conservation, CRL Report 5|accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref>
