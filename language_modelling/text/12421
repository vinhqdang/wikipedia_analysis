'''Hellcat''' ('''Patricia "Patsy" Walker''') is a [[fictional character]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].  She premiered as the star of a [[teen]] [[Romance comics|romantic]]-[[comedy]] series and was later integrated into Marvel [[superhero]] franchises such as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].

Created by [[Ruth Atkinson]], Patsy Walker first appeared in ''[[Miss America (Marvel Comics)|Miss America]] Magazine'' #2 (Nov. 1944), published by Marvel precursor [[Timely Comics]], and became Hellcat in ''The Avengers'' #144 (Feb. 1976).

==Publication history==
===Teen-humor heroine===

Redheaded Patsy Walker, her parents Stanley and Betty, her boyfriend [[Mad Dog (Marvel Comics)|Robert "Buzz" Baxter]], and her raven-haired friendly rival Hedy Wolfe appeared from the 1940s through 1967 in issues of ''Miss America'', ''Teen Comics'', ''Girls' Life'', and namesake series ''Patsy Walker'' and its spin-offs: ''Patsy and Hedy'', ''Patsy and Her Pals'', and the single-issue ''A Date with Patsy''.  These were popular teen-humor comics from Marvel's 1940s and 1950s predecessors, [[Timely Comics]] and [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], respectively. Attesting to its quiet popularity, ''Patsy Walker'' (along with ''[[Millie the Model]]'' and ''[[Kid Colt|Kid Colt, Outlaw]]'') was among the very few titles published continuously by Marvel from the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].

Future ''[[Mad Magazine]]'' [[cartoonist]] and "Fold-In" creator [[Al Jaffee]] wrote and drew most of the early issues <U+2014> which, given the tone and the target audience, incongruously included ''Mad'' founding editor [[Harvey Kurtzman]]'s bizarre "Hey Look!" one-pagers in several.  Jaffee was succeeded by [[Al Hartley]], who would go on to [[Archie Comics]] and produce many [[Christian]] comic books starring Archie characters and others.  [[Morris Weiss]] drew ''Patsy and Her Pals''.  Millie (the Model) Collins made guest appearances in #92 and 98.

In 1964, following Patsy's high-school graduation,{{Issue|date=November 2009}} the title switched from humor to become a young career-gal romantic adventure.  ''Patsy Walker'' lasted through issue #124 (Dec. 1965), with ''Patsy and Hedy'' outlasting it to its own #110 (Feb. 1967).

Patsy and Hedy made a cameo appearance in ''[[Fantastic Four]] [[annual publication|Annual]]'' #3 (1965), establishing them in the [[Marvel Universe]]. The [[superhero]]-team comic ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'' #89 (Nov. 1980) further established that the earlier stories were fictional works published within the fictional [[Marvel Universe]] itself, and written by Patsy's mother Dorothy Walker though based upon Patsy's own life and friends.<ref>Miller, Jonathan. "Beware the Claws of Patsy Walker: The Hellcat Cometh", ''[[Back Issue (magazine)|Back Issue]]'' #40, May 2010, p. 66</ref> The Patsy Walker profile in ''Marvel Legacy: The 1960s Handbook'' #1 (2006) establishes that Walker indeed experienced many of the events from these stories.

===Hellcat===
[[Image:Avengers 144.jpg|thumb||Patsy Walker becomes Hellcat in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]''  #144 (Feb. 1976)]]
Walker embarked on a new career in ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' vol. 2, #13 (July 1973).  There, she met Hank McCoy, one of the original members of the mutant-superhero group the [[X-Men]], in his alter ego as the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]].  Dissatisfied with married life with her old boyfriend [[Mad Dog (Marvel Comics)|"Buzz" Baxter]], now a [[U.S. Air Force]] colonel, she helped the injured Beast in return for "just a costume, with some power, or a serum, or something," wanting to become a superheroine.

Writer [[Steve Englehart]] recalled that Walker's cameo in ''[[Fantastic Four]] [[annual publication|Annual]]'' #3 had
{{blockquote|struck my fan's eye by including her in the [[Marvel Universe]]. ...I thought it would be cool to bring her in as a real character, with things to do. Part of my 'training' as a Marvel writer was writing [[romance comics|romance stories]] and [[Western fiction|Westerns]], but ''Patsy [Walker]'' was defunct as a comic by the time I got there.... Still, as a fan, I had collected everything Marvel, including ''Patsy Walker'' and ''Patsy and Hedy'' ... so I knew them as characters....<ref>Englehart in Miller, p. 62</ref>}}

Shortly afterward, the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], with the Beast and Walker tagging along, invade the corrupt Brand Corporation where Baxter is posted. There she found one of superheroine [[Tigra|Greer Grant Nelson]]'s spare Cat costumes. Immediately donning the yellow cat-suit, Walker dubbed herself Hellcat. "This suit seems to know what to do all by itself!" she thinks. "I always was pretty coordinated, with my [[surfing]] and [[skiing]] <U+2014> but now I'm Olympic material!" Nelson herself, who by this time had become the superpowered [[Tigra]], told Walker, "This wonderful suit was designed to extend any woman's strengths."{{Issue|date=April 2010}} Walker later adapted the suit's look slightly.

Recalled writer Englehart in 2010,
{{blockquote|I wasn't real interested in the Cat. I read the books and they seemed like pandering, frankly <U+2014> not very good stories written to appeal to a demographic. Once [Patsy] entered the [Marvel Universe], met the Beast, confronted her husband <U+2014> all that began to change the Patsy I had inherited to someone a little more savvy. By the time she became the Hellcat, she could stand back far enough to see the ironies in her taking over a feminist creation. But she was really more about jumping into the superhero pool than standing back.... She didn't muse on the irony; she wanted to be a heroine.<ref>Englehart in Miller, p. 63</ref>}}

Hellcat joined the superhero team the ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' in issue #44 (Feb. 1977) of the eponymous comic. After many adventures with the group, she met the supernatural adventurer [[Daimon Hellstrom]], the Son of [[Satan]], in ''The Defenders'' #92 (Feb. 1981). They marry in ''The Defenders'' #125 and become husband-and-wife occult investigators, but Hellstrom's demonic nature asserts itself, and Walker is driven first mad and then, in ''Hellstorm: Prince of Lies'' #14 (May 1994), to [[suicide]]. Through Hellstrom's manipulation of the superhero [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], she was resurrected, in ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts 2000]]'', a summer annual of the superhero-team comic ''Thunderbolts'', and returned to Earth with new abilities acquired while in [[Hell]]. Briefly adopting a new costume and then returning to her traditional yellow outfit, she rejoined the Defenders in a short-lived revival series, ''The Defenders'' vol. 2, #1-12 (March 2001 - Feb. 2002).

After appearing in occasional guest roles, Hellcat starred in the [[miniseries]] ''Patsy Walker: Hellcat'' #1-5 (Sept. 2008 - Feb. 2009). Following this, she was an ensemble star and narrator, alongside the superheroines [[Firestar]], [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], and [[Monica Rambeau|Photon]], in the miniseries ''[[Marvel Divas]]'' #1-4 (Sept.-Dec. 2009), which writers [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] and Tonci Zonjic had pitched to Marvel editors as "''[[Sex and the City]]'' in the Marvel Universe".<ref name="marveldivas">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=92159514&blogId=482150960|title=MyCup o<U+2019> Joe Tea, Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning |date=2009-04-09|publisher=MySpace Comic Books|accessdate=2009-04-10}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
After growing up in suburban Centerville, graduating high school and marrying high-school sweetheart [[Mad Dog (Marvel Comics)|Robert "Buzz" Baxter]], Patsy Walker becomes an assistant to scientist Hank McCoy, the mutant [[superhero]] the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], who at that time was on hiatus from the [[X-Men]]. Estranged from her husband, now a [[U.S. Air Force]] colonel, Walker befriends McCoy and, desiring to become a superhero, accompanied McCoy on an adventure with the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. She adopts an ability-enhancing costume that formerly belonged to [[Tigra|Greer Grant Nelson]], the former masked adventuress the Cat.

When that costume became contaminated with radioactivity in a [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]]-like nuclear disaster engineered by the [[supervillain]] the [[Presence (Marvel Comics)|Presence]], Walker creates a similar outfit of her own,{{Issue|date=April 2010}} substituting blue clawed gloves and talon-toed boots, retaining only the cable-claws strapped to each wrist. The new costume has a blue cowl instead of yellow.

After having used her natural athletic abilities and good instincts to rescue the Avengers, Walker is offered membership in the team.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} The cosmic adventurer [[Moondragon]] persuades her to decline and instead accompany Moondragon to the [[Saturn]] moon of [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titan]] for training in [[psychic]] ability and advanced [[martial arts]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}} Walker's training is abbreviated when she returns to Earth to assist the supernatural hero [[Doctor Strange]], and then join the superhero team the ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]''. Moondragon revokes her psychic abilities, citing Walker's ineffective use of them as the cause.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

She meets her future husband [[Daimon Hellstrom]], the Son of [[Satan]], during the course of her Defenders adventuring. After learning that her mother had promised her soul to Satan, and briefly being lied to by the Devil that he was her father, Walker reunites with her real father and marries Hellstrom. The two then retire from superheroics.  Ultimately, Hellstrom's demonic inheritance took possession of him and drove Walker insane.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} Institutionalized, she was driven to [[suicide]] by the otherworldly being [[Deathurge]].

Trapped in [[Hell]], Walker's spirit is used in a series of gladiatorial-like combat scenarios. There, she learns to develop and use her psychic powers. Hellstrom tricks the archer superhero [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] into returning her spirit to Earth; Hawkeye believes he is retrieving his presumed-dead wife, [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], from the demonic lord [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]'s realm. Resurrected and back on Earth, Walker retains the powers she developed in Hell. Now able to manifest a costume at will, Walker adopts a reversed version of the Cat costume, with a blue cat-suit and cowl with yellow gloves and boots. In this new guise, and once again a member of the Defenders, Hellcat focuses on combating [[occult]] evils, notably [[Nicholas Scratch]], who had based himself in her hometown of Centerville, and the otherdimensional ruler [[Dormammu]].

During the superhero [[Civil War (comics)|"Civil War"]] over the federal [[Registration acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]], Hellcat willingly registers.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} She serves as one of the young superheroes' instructors at [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #10</ref> She was then assigned as an official superhero in [[Alaska]],<ref>''Patsy Walker: Hellcat'' #1-5</ref> but eventually returned to [[New York City]].<ref>''[[Marvel Divas]]'' #1-4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Hellcat can sense mystical phenomena or those items or persons touched by mystical energy. She can use a force field that deflects mystical attacks. She is able to summon her costume at will. Patsy is a well-trained martial artist, having been taught by both [[Captain America]] and [[Moondragon]].
