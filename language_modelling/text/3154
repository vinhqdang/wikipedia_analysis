Technopark is promoted by the Government of [[Kerala]], with a mandate to promote [[entrepreneurship]] and employment in the region. The policy of [[Economic reforms in India|economic liberalisation]] initiated by the [[government of India]] in 1991 and the rapid growth of the global software industry during the 1990s has substantially contributed to the growth of Technopark. Over 70% of Kerala's IT exports are from Technopark.<ref name="Technopark exports to touch Rs 600 Cr. in 2005">{{cite news

== History and mission ==

In July 1990, the Government of Kerala conceptualized Technopark as a facility to foster the development of high-technology industries in the state. Technopark was set up under the auspices of Electronics Technology Park, Kerala &mdash; an autonomous body under the Department of Information Technology of the government of Kerala.

Technopark's aim was to create infrastructure and provide support required for the development of  high-technology companies. Its stated mission is to ''"Provide, Viably, Superior Environment and Services with Assured Quality of Service to Make Technology Businesses Intrinsically Competitive And Successful, and Promote Regional Development through Synergistic Linkages Between Industry, Government and Academia, based on Continuous Improvement and Innovation"''<ref name="Mission of Technopark">{{cite web
| publisher=Technopark 
| url=http://www.technopark.org/mission.htm
| title=Mission of Technopark
| accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref>

The foundation stone for the first building in Technopark was laid on [[March 31]] [[1991]] by then Kerala Chief Minister, [[E.K. Nayanar]]. Noted industrialist K.P.P. Nambiar was Technopark's first Chairman. Technopark was formally dedicated to the nation by then Prime Minister, [[P.V. Narasimha Rao]] in 1992.<ref name="History of Technopark">{{cite web
| publisher=Technopark 
| url=http://www.technopark.org/campusnote.htm
| title= Thejaswini dedicated to the nation by Chief Minister
| accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref>

Since then, Technopark has been growing steadily both in size and employee strength. Park Centre, Pamba and Periyar were the only buildings in the beginning. Since then, Technopark has periodically added new buildings such as Nila, Gayathri and Bhavani. With the inauguration of the 850,000&nbsp;sq ft. (85,000&nbsp;sq m.) Thejaswini on [[February 22]] [[2007]], Technopark became the largest IT Park in India.<ref name="Largest IT Park in India">{{cite news

== Infrastructure==

Technopark aims to provide all the infrastructure and support facilities needed for IT/ITES and electronics companies to function. In addition to built-up office space, it also provides all utilities as well as the connectivity. This is done either directly or through private partners. In addition, Technopark provides [[Business incubator|business incubation]] facilities for start-up firms as well as some social infrastructure for the [[personnel]] working in the park.

===Buildings===
[[Image:bhavaniinterior.jpg|right|thumb|200px| Interior of Bhavani building]]
There are currently about a dozen buildings inside the Technopark campus intended for [[software development]].

The seventh building is named ''Thejaswini'' and was commissioned in February 2007, with over 600,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft. (60,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;m.) of carpet area. There are also independent buildings of private enterprises such as [[Tata Consultancy Services Limited|TCS]], M-Square, IVL, NEST, IBS, Leela Group and others inside the Phase I campus. These buildings aggregate to a total of about 3.5 million&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft. (350,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;m.) of space, either complete or under construction.

===Utilities and support facilities===
Technopark offers electricity through a 110&nbsp;[[Kilovolt|KV]], 30&nbsp;[[AC power|MVA]] dedicated internal power distribution system with built-in redundancies at all levels. Technopark is a licensee for distribution of power in the campus. Water supply is distributed by Technopark through a dedicated distribution system.

Technopark has support facilities such as a satellite earth station, a 200-seater [[convention center]], a club and guest house, a shopping complex (Techno-Mall), banks, [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]s, restaurants and conference rooms on campus. Furthermore, setting up of new units is accelerated by exemption from State level clearances as well as through ready-to-use incubation facilities.

===Connectivity===
Trivandrum is connected to the National Internet Backbone and Technopark is serviced by a variety of bandwidth providers, including [[Reliance Infocomm]], [[Bharti Airtel]], [[Videsh Sanchar Nigam|VSNL]] and [[Asianet|Asianet Dataline]], through fibre optic lines in the campus. There is a satellite earth station inside the Phase I campus as well.

Recently, FLAG Telecom&mdash;a subsidiary of [[Reliance Infocomm]]&mdash;has landed its FALCON global cable system at Trivandrum. This provides upto 2.56&nbsp;[[Terabit]]s of connectivity with the [[Middle East]], [[South East Asia]], [[Far East]], [[Europe]] and [[North America]] (in conjunction with the rest of the FLAG network). Trivandrum will also have direct connectivity to the [[Maldives]] and [[Sri Lanka]] within the FLAG network.<ref name="FALCON cable lands at Trivandrum">{{cite news
