Associated features of bipolar disorder are clinical phenomena that often accompany [[bipolar disorder]] (BD) but are not part of the diagnostic criteria for the disorder. There are several childhood precursors in children who later receive a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. They may show subtle early traits such as mood abnormalities, full major depressive episodes, and [[ADHD]].<ref name="pmid2504732">{{cite journal |author=Andreoli TE |title=Molecular aspects of endocrinology |journal=Hosp.

==Childhood precursors==
Some limited long-term studies indicate that children who later receive a diagnosis of bipolar disorder may show subtle early traits such as subthreshold cyclical mood abnormalities, full major depressive episodes, and possibly [[ADHD]] with mood fluctuation. There may be hypersensitivity and irritability. There is some disagreement whether the experiences are necessarily fluctuating or may be chronic.<ref name="Miklowitz2008">David J.

==Cognitive functioning==
{{further|[[Creativity and mental illness]]}}
Reviews have indicated that most individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but who are [[euthymia (medicine)|euthymic]] (not experiencing major depression or mania), do not show [[neuropsychological]] deficits on most tests.<ref name="Mansell2008" /> [[Meta-analyses]] have indicated, by averaging the variable findings of many studies, [[cognitive deficits]] on some measures of sustained [[attention]], [[executive function]] and [[declarative memory|verbal memory]], in terms of group averages.

Psychological studies of bipolar disorder have examined the development of a wide range of both the core symptoms of psychomotor activation and related clusterings of depression/anxiety, increased [[hedonic]] tone, irritability/aggression and sometimes psychosis. The existing evidence has been described as patchy in terms of quality but converging in a consistent manner. The findings suggest that the period leading up to mania is often characterized by depression and anxiety at first, with isolated sub-clinical symptoms of mania such as increased energy and racing thoughts. The latter increase and lead to increased activity levels, the more so if there is disruption in [[circadian rhythms]] or goal attainment events. There is some indication that once mania has begun to develop, social [[stress (biological)|stressors]], including criticism from significant others, can further contribute. There are also indications that individuals may hold certain beliefs about [[self|themselves]], their internal states, and their [[social world]] (including striving to meet high standards despite it causing distress) that may make them vulnerable during changing mood states in the face of relevant life events. In addition, subtle frontal-temporal and subcortical difficulties in ''some'' individuals, related to planning, emotional regulation and attentional control, may play a role. Symptoms are often subthreshold and likely continuous with normal experience. Once (hypo)mania has developed, there is an overall increase in [[arousal|activation]] levels and [[impulsivity]]. Negative social reactions or advice may be taken less notice of, and a person may be more caught up in their own thoughts and interpretations, often along a theme of feeling criticised. There is some suggestion that the mood variation in bipolar disorder may not be cyclical as often assumed, nor completely random, but results from a complex interaction between internal and external variables unfolding over time; there is mixed evidence as to whether relevant life events are found more often in early than later episodes.<ref name="Mansell2008">{{cite journal | pmid = 17825463 | doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2007.07.010 | volume=28 | issue=3 | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | year=2008 | title = The ascent into mania: A review of psychological processes associated with the development of manic symptoms | month=March | pages=494<U+2013>520 | author=Mansell W, Pedley R | ref = harv}}</ref> Many sufferers report inexplicably varied cyclical patterns, however.<ref>Manic-depressive illness FK Goodwin, KR Jamison&nbsp;<U+2013> 1990&nbsp;<U+2013> Oxford University Press New York</ref>

A series of authors have described mania or hypomania as being related to a high [[motivation]] to achieve, ambitious [[goal]]-setting, and sometimes high [[achievement]]. One study indicated that the pursuit of goals, encouraged by sometimes achieving them, can become [[emotional dysregulation|emotionally dysregulated]] and involve the development of mania.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Johnson SL |title=Mania and dysregulation in goal pursuit: a review |journal=Clin Psychol Rev |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=241<U+2013>62 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15642648 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2004.11.002 |url= |pmc=2847498|ref=harv}}</ref> Individuals may have low [[self-esteem]] and difficulties in social [[adjustment]], however, and by definition there are periods of depression with difficulty in motivation and functioning.<ref name="pmid15023484">{{Cite journal|author=Blairy S, Linotte S, Souery D, ''et al.'' |title=Social adjustment and self-esteem of bipolar patients: a multicentric study |journal=J Affect Disord |volume=79 |issue=1<U+2013>3 |pages=97<U+2013>103 |year=2004 |month=April |pmid=15023484 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(02)00347-6 |url=|ref=harv}}</ref>

==Self-medication==
Often bipolar individuals are subject to [[self-medication]] with non-prescribed drugs such as [[alcohol]], [[tobacco]] and other [[recreational drug]]s.<ref>{{cite doi|10.3109/10673229809000321}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/S0165-0327(02)00454-8}}</ref>

There is some evidence that, although bipolar patients in general do not appear to smoke significantly more than other people, the subset of bipolar patients with a history of psychosis may smoke more heavily than the general population.<ref>{{cite pmid|11435266}}</ref>
