''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s development team included three designers that Square dubbed the "Dream Team": [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], the creator of Square's ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series; [[Yuji Horii]], a freelance designer and creator of [[Enix]]'s popular ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series; and [[Akira Toriyama]], a freelance manga artist famed for his work with ''Dragon Quest'' and ''[[Dragon Ball]]''.

Square re-released a ported version by [[Tose (company)|Tose]] in Japan for [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1999, later repackaged with a ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'' port as ''[[Final Fantasy Chronicles]]'' in 2001 for the North American market. A slightly enhanced ''Chrono Trigger'' was  released for the [[Nintendo DS]] on November 25, 2008, in North America and Japan, and went on sale in Australia on February 3, 2009 and in Europe on February 6, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://na.square-enix.com/ctds/ |title=Chrono Trigger for Nintendo DS |publisher=Square Enix |date= |accessdate=2009-02-16}}</ref> The game was never released in PAL territories before the Nintendo DS version.

''Chrono Trigger'' was a critical and commercial success upon release and is considered today to be one of the greatest video games of all time. ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' magazine described aspects of ''Chrono Trigger'' as revolutionary, including its multiple endings, plot-related [[Quest (gaming)|sidequests]] focusing on character development, unique battle system, and detailed graphics.<ref name="npreview1">{{Cite journal |month=July | year=1995 |volume=74 |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |title=Epic Center: Chrono Trigger |pages=&nbsp;52}}</ref> ''Chrono Trigger'' was the third best-selling game of 1995, and the game's SNES and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] iterations have shipped 2.65 million copies as of March 2003.<ref name="1995 sales"/><ref name="square-sales"/> The version for the Nintendo DS sold 790,000 copies as of March 2009.<ref name="square-sales-ds">{{cite web |url=http://www.square-enix.com/eng/pdf/news/20090525_01en.pdf#page=7 |title=Results Briefing Session for the Fiscal Year ended March 31, 2009 |date=2009-05-25 |accessdate=2010-07-16 |publisher=[[Square Enix]] |page=28 |format=PDF}}</ref> ''Chrono Trigger'' was also ported to mobile phones,<ref name="mobileteaser">{{cite web | month=January| year=2011 | title=Chrono Trigger &#124; Square Enix | url=http://www.square-enix.co.jp/mobile/sem/chronotrigger/ | publisher=[[Square Enix]] | accessdate=2011-02-02 }}</ref> [[Virtual Console]],<ref name="virtualconsole">{{cite web | month=March| year=2011 | title=Chrono Trigger Time Warps to Virtual Console Next Month &#124; Siliconera | url=http://www.siliconera.com/2011/03/25/chrono-trigger-time-warps-to-virtual-console-next-month/ | publisher=Siliconera.com | accessdate=2011-03-26 }}</ref> the [[PlayStation Network]] (only in the USA),<ref>{{cite web|title= Chrono Trigger Coming to PS3|url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/116/1163570p1.html|accessdate=April 22, 2011}}</ref> [[iOS]] devices,<ref>{{cite news|title=TGS '11: Square Enix announces Chrono Trigger for iOS and Android, Dragon Quest Monsters and Ithadaki Street also revealed|newspaper=[[Pocket Gamer]]|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Multiformat/Chrono+Trigger/news.asp?c=33458|date=16 September 2011}}</ref> and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.<ref>{{cite web| year=2011 | title=Square Enix Market - Chrono Trigger|url=http://www.square-enix.co.jp/smart/market/game005.html|publisher=[[Square Enix]]|accessdate=2012-6-25}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
''Chrono Trigger'' features standard [[role-playing video game]] gameplay with several innovations. The player controls the protagonist and his companions in the game's [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] [[fictional universe|fictional world]], consisting of various forests, cities, and dungeons. Navigation occurs via an [[overworld]] map, depicting the landscape from a scaled down overhead view. Areas such as forests, cities, and similar places are depicted as more realistic scaled down maps, in which players can converse with locals to procure items and services, solve puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies. ''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s gameplay deviates from that of traditional RPGs in that, rather than appearing in [[random encounter]]s, many enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party. Contact with enemies on a field map initiates a battle that occurs directly on the map rather than on a separate battle screen.<ref name="npreview2">{{Cite journal |month=July | year=1995 |volume=74 |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |title=Epic Center: Chrono Trigger |pages=&nbsp;53}}</ref>

[[File:ChronoTriggerInside.PNG|thumb|left|Unlike traditional RPGs, combat in ''Chrono Trigger'' occurs in the same setting where general navigation occurs.|alt=A wooded area rendered in the Super Nintendo's graphics, two gray status bars (one at the top, one at the bottom of the screen), three "Blue Imp" enemies surrounding the character Crono in the middle of the area, Crono slashing at the topmost imp which has a surprised expression on its face]]

Players and enemies may use physical or magical attacks to wound targets during battle, and players may use items to heal or protect themselves.  Each character and enemy has a certain number of [[hit point]]s, and successful attacks reduce that character's hit points, while hit points can be restored with potions and spells.  When a playable character loses all hit points, he or she faints; if all the player's characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved chapter, except in specific storyline-related battles that allow or force the player to lose.  Between battles, the player can equip his/her characters with weapons, armor, helmets, and accessories that provide special effects (such as increased attack power or defense against magic), and various consumable items can be used both in and out of battles.  Items and equipment can be purchased in shops or found on field maps, often in [[treasure chest (video games)|treasure chests]].  By exploring new areas and fighting enemies, players progress through ''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s story.

''Chrono Trigger'' uses an [[Active Time Battle]] system<U+2014>a staple of Square's ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' game series designed by [[Hiroyuki Ito]] for ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''<U+2014>named "Active Time Battle 2.0."<ref name="Battle 2.0">{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co. | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System  | quote='''Menu screen:''' Active Time Battle 2.0}}</ref> The new name is attributed to battles taking place on the field and the [[area of effect]] nature of certain spells and abilities.<ref name=zjs_ultimania/> Each character can take action in battle once a personal timer dependent on the character's speed [[Attribute (role-playing games)|statistic]] counts to zero. Magic and special physical techniques are handled through a system called "Techs." Techs deplete a character's [[magic point]]s (a numerical meter like hit points), and often have special areas of effect; some spells damage huddled monsters, while others can harm enemies spread in a line. Enemies often change positions during battle, creating opportunities for tactical Tech use. A unique feature of ''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Tech system is that numerous cooperative techniques exist.<ref name="npreview2" /> Each character receives eight personal Techs which can be used in conjunction with others' to create Double and Triple Techs for greater effect. For instance, Crono's sword-spinning ''Cyclone'' Tech can be combined with Lucca's ''Flame Toss'' to create ''Flame Whirl''. When characters with compatible Techs have enough magic points available to perform their techniques, the game automatically displays the combo as an option.

''Chrono Trigger'' features several other unique gameplay traits, including [[time travel]]. Players have access to seven eras of the game world's history, and past actions affect future events. Throughout history, players find new allies, complete side quests, and search for keynote villains. Time travel is accomplished via portals and pillars of light called "time gates", as well as a [[time travel|time machine]] named ''Epoch''. The game contains thirteen unique endings; the ending the player receives depends on when and how he or she reaches and completes the game's final battle.<ref name="nppreview">{{Cite journal| volume=73 |month=June | year=1995 |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |title=Chrono Trigger: A New Standard for RPGs | pages=&nbsp;37}}</ref> ''Chrono Trigger DS'' features a new ending that can be accessed from the End of Time upon completion of the final extra dungeon and optional final boss.<ref name="dsultimania">{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Chrono Trigger Ultimania | page=581 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Supporting_Material_Translation.html#Chrono_Trigger_Ultimania | isbn=978-4-7575-2469-9}}</ref> ''Chrono Trigger'' also introduces a [[New Game Plus|New Game+]] option; after completing the game, the player may begin a new game with the same character [[Experience point|levels]], [[Statistic (role-playing games)|techniques]], and equipment, excluding money, with which he or she ended the previous play through. However, certain items central to the storyline are removed and must be found again, such as the sword Masamune. Square has since employed the New Game+ concept in later titles, including ''[[Chrono Cross]]'', ''[[Parasite Eve (video game)|Parasite Eve]]'', ''[[Vagrant Story]]''  and ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]''.

==Plot==
===Setting===
''Chrono Trigger'' takes place in a world similar to Earth, with eras such as the prehistoric age, except that [[human]]s and dinosaurs share the earth; the [[Middle Ages]], replete with knights, monsters, and magic; and the [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] future, where humans and sentient robots struggle to survive. The characters frequently [[time travel|travel through time]] to obtain allies, gather equipment, and learn information to help them in their quest. The party also gains access to the End of Time (represented as year [[Infinity|<U+221E>]]), which serves as a hub to travel back to other time periods. The party eventually acquires a time-machine vehicle known as the ''Wings of Time,'' nicknamed the ''Epoch.'' The vehicle is capable of time travel between any time period without first having to travel to the End of Time.

===Characters===
{{main|List of characters in Chrono Trigger}}
''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s seven playable characters come from different eras of history. ''Chrono Trigger'' begins in AD 1000 with [[Crono (Chrono Trigger)|Crono]], [[Marle (Chrono Trigger)|Marle]] and [[Lucca Ashtear|Lucca]]. Crono is the silent protagonist, characterized as a fearless young man who wields a [[katana]] in battle. Marle (Princess Nadia) lives in Guardia Castle; though sheltered, at heart she's a princess who enjoys hiding her royal identity. Lucca is a friend of Crono's and a mechanical genius; her home is filled with laboratory equipment and machinery. From the era of AD 2300 comes [[Robo (Chrono Trigger)|Robo]], or Prometheus (designation R-66Y), a robot with near-human personality created to assist humans. Lying dormant in the future, Robo is found and repaired by Lucca, and joins the group out of gratitude.<ref name="characters">{{cite book | year=2001 | title=Final Fantasy Chronicles instruction manual | pages=&nbsp;32<U+2013>33 | publisher=Square Enix  | id=SLUS-01363}}</ref> The fiercely confident [[Ayla (Chrono Trigger)|Ayla]] dwells in 65,000,000 BC. Unmatched in raw strength, Ayla is the chief of Ioka Village and leads her people in war against a species of humanoid [[reptile]]s known as Reptites.

The last two playable characters are [[Glenn (Chrono Trigger)|Frog]] and [[Magil|Magus]]. Frog originated in AD 600. He is a former [[squire]] once named Glenn, who was turned into an [[Kemono|anthropomorphic]] frog by Magus, who also killed his friend Cyrus. Chivalrous but mired in regret, Frog dedicates his life to protecting Leene, the queen of Guardia, and avenging Cyrus. Meanwhile, Guardia in AD 600 is in a state of conflict against the Mystics (known as Fiends in the US/DS port), a race of demons and intelligent animals who wage war against humanity under the leadership of Magus, a powerful [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]]. Magus's seclusion conceals a long-lost past; he was formerly known as Janus, the young prince of the Kingdom of Zeal, which was destroyed by Lavos in 12,000 BC. The incident sent him forward through time, and as he ages, he plots revenge against Lavos and broods over the fate of his sister, [[Schala]].<ref name="characters" /> Lavos, who awakens and ravages the world in AD 1999, is an extraterrestrial parasitic creature that harvests DNA and the Earth's energy for its own growth.

===Story===
In AD 1000, Crono and Marle watch Lucca and her father demonstrate her new [[Teleportation|teleporter]] at the Millennial Fair. When Marle volunteers to be teleported, her pendant interferes with the device and creates a time portal into which she is drawn.<ref name="portal">{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 |platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System |level=Leene Square |quote='''Taban:''' What's going on Lucca? WHERE IS SHE? / '''Lucca:''' The way she disappeared... It couldn't have been the Telepod! The warp field seemed to be affected by her pendant...}}</ref>  After Crono and Lucca separately recreate the portal and find themselves in AD 600, they find Marle only to see her vanish before their eyes. Lucca realizes that this time period's kingdom has mistaken Marle for an ancestor of hers who had been kidnapped, thus putting off the recovery effort for her ancestor and creating a [[grandfather paradox]]. Crono and Lucca, with the help of Frog, restore history to normal by recovering the kidnapped queen. After returning to the present, Crono is arrested on charges of kidnapping the princess and sentenced to death by the current chancellor of Guardia. Lucca and Marle help Crono to flee, haphazardly using another time portal to escape their pursuers. This portal lands them in AD 2300, where they learn that an advanced civilization has been wiped out by a giant creature known as Lavos that appeared in 1999.<ref name="dayoflavos">{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System |level=Arris Dome |quote='''Marle:''' Say, what does this button do? / '''Lucca:''' 1999 A.D.?

After meeting and repairing Robo, Crono and his friends find Gaspar, an old sage at the End of Time, who helps them acquire magical powers and travel through time by way of several pillars of light.

Their party expands to include Ayla and Frog after they visit the prehistoric era to repair Frog's sword. They return to AD 600 to challenge Magus, believing him to be the source of Lavos; after the battle, a summoning spell causes a time gate that throws Crono and his friends to the past.<ref name="lavos-created">{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System |level=Heckran Cave |quote='''Heckran:''' If only the great Magus who brought forth Lavos 400 years ago, had destroyed the human race! }}</ref> In prehistory, the group battle the Reptites and witness the origin of Lavos. They learn that Lavos was an alien being that arrived on the planet millions of years in the past, and began to absorb [[DNA]] and energy from every living creature before arising and razing the planet's surface in 1999 so that it could spawn a new generation. In 12,000 BC, Crono and friends find that the Kingdom of Zeal recently discovered Lavos and seeks to drain its power to achieve immortality through the Mammon Machine. However Zeal's leader, Queen Zeal, banishes them from the realm and seals the time gate they used to travel to the Dark Ages. They return next to AD 2300 to find a time machine called the Wings of Time (or ''Epoch''), which can access any time period without using a time gate. They travel back to Zeal for the Mammon Machine's activation at the Ocean Palace. Lavos awakens, disturbed by the Mammon Machine, and the prophet of Zeal reveals himself to be Magus and tries to kill the creature.<ref name="magusrevealed">{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System |level=Heckran Cave |quote='''Magus:''' I've waited for this...

My powers are being drained! }}</ref> Crono stands up to Lavos but is vaporized by a powerful blast, after which Lavos destroys the Kingdom of Zeal.

Janus took the alias of Magus and gained a cult of followers while plotting to summon and kill Lavos in revenge for the death of his sister, Schala, but when Lavos appeared after his battle with Crono and his allies he was cast back to the time of Zeal and presented himself to them as a prophet. As Crono's friends depart, the Ocean Palace rises into the air as the Black Omen. The group turns to Gaspar for help, and he gives them a "Chrono Trigger," an egg-shaped device that allows the group to replace Crono just before the moment of death with a [[doppleganger|Dopple Doll]]. Crono and his friends then gather power by helping people across time with Gaspar's instructions.<ref name="itll-help">{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System |level= The End of Time |quote='''Gaspar:''' Just as you touch the lives of every life form you meet, so, too, will their energy strengthen you. }}</ref> Their journeys involve defeating the remnants of the Mystics,<ref name="generals">{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System |level=Ozzie's Fort |quote='''Ozzie:''' Magus!

If Magus joined the party, he departs to search for Schala. Crono's mother accidentally enters the time gate at the fair before it closes, prompting Crono, Marle, and Lucca to set out in the Epoch to find her while fireworks light up the night sky.<ref name="crono'smom">{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System |level=Leene Square |quote='''Mom:''' Look, Crono!

Crono jumps on to help her, but cannot bring them down to earth. Hanging on in each others arms, the pair travel through the cloudy, moonlit sky.

''Chrono Trigger DS'' added two new scenarios to the game.<ref name="dsultimania" /> In the first, Crono and his friends can help a "lost sanctum" of Reptites, who reward powerful items and armor. The second scenario adds ties to ''Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s sequel, ''Chrono Cross''.<ref name="dsultimania" /> In a New Game +, the group can explore several temporal distortions to combat shadow versions of Crono, Marle, and Lucca, and to fight Dalton, who promises in defeat to raise an army in the town of Porre to destroy the Kingdom of Guardia.<ref name="daltonpromise">{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-11-25 | platform =Nintendo DS |level=Twilight Grotto |quote='''Dalton''': If it weren't for you, I'd have been the ruler of an age all my own!

A version of Magus pleads with Schala to resist; though she recognizes him as her brother, she refuses to be helped and sends him away.

''Chrono Trigger'' was conceived in 1992 by [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], producer and creator of the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series; [[Yuji Horii]], director and creator of the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series; and [[Akira Toriyama]], famous [[manga artist]] and creator of the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' series.<ref name="vjump1">{{cite video | date=1994 | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Alpha_Version_Screenshot.html | title=V-Jump Festival 1994 | medium=VHS tape | location=Japan | publisher=Shueisha}}</ref> Traveling to America to research computer graphics, the three decided to create something that "no one had done before."<ref name="vjump1" /> After spending over a year considering the difficulties of developing a new game, they received a call from [[Kazuhiko Aoki]], who offered to produce.<ref name="vjump1" /> The four met and spent four days brainstorming ideas for the game.<ref name="vjump1" /> Aoki ultimately produced ''Chrono Trigger'', while director credits were attributed to [[Akihiko Matsui]], [[Yoshinori Kitase]] and [[Takashi Tokita]]. Toriyama designed the game's aesthetic, including characters, monsters, vehicles, and the look of each era.<ref name="vjump1" /> [[Masato Kato]] also contributed character ideas and designs.<ref name="dsultimania" /> Kato planned to feature Gaspar as a playable character and Toriyama sketched him, but he was cut early in development.<ref name="vjumpplayersguide">{{cite book | year=1995 | editor=V-Jump | title=Chrono Trigger V-Jump Player's Guide | page=189 | language=Japanese | publisher=V-Jump}}</ref> The development staff studied the drawings of Toriyama to approximate his style.<ref name="perfectinterview" /> Sakaguchi and Horii supervised; Sakaguchi was responsible for the game's overall system and contributed several monster ideas.<ref name="vjump1" /><ref name="perfectinterview" /> Other notable designers include [[Tetsuya Takahashi]], the graphic director, and [[Yasuyuki Honne]], [[Tetsuya Nomura]], and [[Yusuke Naora]], who worked as field graphic artists.<ref name="creditscc">{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger ([http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Chrono_Trigger_Credits.html Credits]) | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System }}</ref> Yasuhika Kamata programmed graphics, and cited [[Ridley Scott]]'s visual work in the film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' as an inspiration for the game's lighting.<ref name="gamest" /> Kamata made the game's luminosity and color choice lay between that of ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' and the ''Final Fantasy'' series.<ref name="gamest" />

[[Hiroyuki Ito]] was responsible for the animations of characters during event scenes and battle scenes and also responsible for the locations of enemies on the field map and how it would seamlessly transition into a battle when a player approached where the enemies were located. Due to battles taking place on the field map, he also had to create a short event scene before every battle started that would transition the gameplay from exploration to battle.<ref name=zjs_ultimania/> His experience working on ''Chrono Trigger'' led to him continuing to want to get rid of [[random battles]] in future games he would work on.<ref name=zjs_ultimania/> He believes he created an even more seamless battle system with the Active Dimension Battle (ADB) for ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]''.<ref name=zjs_ultimania/> His favorite character animation he made in ''Chrono Trigger'' is the battle victory animation of [[Crono]]. He made Crono [[break the fourth wall]] and give the player a thumbs up. He added this as he believed it would feel encouraging from the perspective of the player to see the game congratulating their victory.<ref name=zjs_ultimania/> This mindset was also the source of the "Congratulations" message that appears on the screen when a player defeats a boss in ''Final Fantasy XII''.<ref name=zjs_ultimania>{{cite journal|title=Interview with the Producer/Director|journal=Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System Ultimania|date=6 September 2007|author=Studio BentStuff|publisher=[[Square Enix]]}}</ref>

Yuji Horii, a fan of [[time travel in fiction|time travel]] fiction (such as the TV series ''[[Time Tunnel]]''), fostered a theme of time travel in his general story outline of ''Chrono Trigger'' with input from Akira Toriyama.<ref>{{cite web | title=Yuji Horii interview | url=http://www.playmagazine.com/index.php?fuseaction=SiteMain.showGamePage&Game_ID=169 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060325111040/http://www.playmagazine.com/index.php?fuseaction=SiteMain.showGamePage&Game_ID=169 | archivedate=2006-03-25 | author=Play staff |publisher=''[[Play (US magazine)|Play]]'' online | accessdate=February 16, 2007}}</ref><ref name="ultimania" /> Horii liked the scenario of the grandfather paradox surrounding Marle.<ref name="perfectinterview" /> Concerning story planning, Horii commented, "If there's a fairground, I just write that there's a fairground; I don't write down any of the details. Then the staff brainstorm and come up with a variety of attractions to put in."<ref name="perfectinterview" /> Sakaguchi contributed some minor elements, including the character Gato; he liked Marle's drama and reconciliation with her father.<ref name="perfectinterview" /> Masato Kato subsequently edited and completed the outline by writing the majority of the game's story, including all the events of the 12,000 BC. era.<ref name="procyon" /> Kato and other developers held a series of meetings to ensure continuity, usually attended by around 30 personnel.<ref name="gamest" /> Kato devised the system of multiple endings because he could not branch the story out to different paths.<ref name="weeklyfamitsu" /> [[Yoshinori Kitase]] and [[Takashi Tokita]] then wrote various [[subplot]]s.<ref name="procyon" /> Kato became friends with composer Yasunori Mitsuda during development, and they would collaborate on several future projects.<ref name="procyon" /> Katsuhisa Higuchi programmed the battle system, which hosted combat on the map without transition to a special battleground as most previous Square games had done.<ref name="gamest" /> Higuchi noted extreme difficulty in loading battles properly without slow-downs or a brief, black loading screen.<ref name="gamest" /> The game's use of animated monster sprites consumed much more memory than previous ''Final Fantasy'' games, which used static enemy graphics.<ref name="gamest" />

Hironobu Sakaguchi likened the development of ''Chrono Trigger'' to "play[ing] around with Toriyama's universe," citing the inclusion of humorous sequences in the game that would have been "impossible with something like ''Final Fantasy''."<ref name="perfectinterview" /> When Square Co. suggested a non-human player character, developers created Frog by adapting one of Toriyama's sketches.<ref name="perfectinterview" /> The team created the End of Time to help players with hints, worrying that they might become stuck and need to consult a walkthrough.<ref name="perfectinterview" /> The game's testers had previously complained that ''Chrono Trigger'' was too difficult; as Horii explained, "It's because we know too much. The developers think the game's just right; that they're being too soft. They're thinking from their own experience. The puzzles were the same. Lots of players didn't figure out things we thought they'd get easily."<ref name="perfectinterview" /> Sakaguchi later cited the unusual desire of beta testers to play the game a second time or "travel through time again" as an affirmation of the New Game + feature: "Wherever we could, we tried to make it so that a slight change in your behavior caused subtle differences in people's reactions, even down to the smallest details...I think the second playthrough will hold a whole new interest."<ref name="perfectinterview" /> The game's reuse of locations due to time traveling made bug-fixing difficult, as corrections would cause unintended consequences in other eras.<ref name="gamest">{{Cite journal |month=March | year=1995 |journal=Gamest |publisher=Shinseisha |url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Supporting_Material_Translation.html#Chrono_Trigger_Gamest_Coverage |pages=211<U+2013>215 |title=Chrono Trigger Development Team Special Talk}}</ref>

''Chrono Trigger'' used a 32-[[megabit]] [[ROM cartridge]] with battery-backed [[Random access memory|RAM]] for [[saved game]]s, lacking special on-cartridge coprocessors.

===PlayStation release===
Square released an enhanced [[porting|port]] of ''Chrono Trigger'' developed by [[TOSE|Tose]] in Japan for the Sony [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1999. Square timed its release before that of ''[[Chrono Cross]]'', the 1999 sequel to ''Chrono Trigger'', to familiarize new players with story leading up to it.<ref name="ultimania" /> This version included [[anime]] cut scenes created by original character designer Akira Toriyama's [[Bird Studio]] and animated by [[Toei Animation]], as well as several bonus features, accessible after achieving various endings in the game. Scenarist Masato Kato attended planning meetings at Bird Studio to discuss how the ending cut scenes would illustrate subtle ties to ''[[Chrono Cross]]''.<ref name="ultimania" /> The port was later released in North America in 2001<U+2014>along with a newly translated version of ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''<U+2014>under the package title ''[[Final Fantasy Chronicles]]''.

''Chrono Trigger'' was scored primarily by [[Yasunori Mitsuda]], as well as veteran ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]], with one track composed by both Uematsu and [[Noriko Matsueda]]. A sound programmer at the time, Mitsuda was unhappy with his pay and threatened to leave Square if he could not compose music.<ref name="powerup" /> Hironobu Sakaguchi suggested he score ''Chrono Trigger'', remarking, "maybe your salary will go up."<ref name="mitsuda2008" /> Mitsuda composed new music and drew on a personal collection of songs composed over the previous two years.<ref name="dsultimania" /> He reflected, "I wanted to create music that wouldn't fit into any established genre...music of an imaginary world. The game's director, Masato Kato, was my close friend, and so I'd always talk with him about the setting and the scene before going into writing."<ref name="powerup" /> Mitsuda slept in his studio several nights, and attributed certain songs<U+2014>such as the game's ending theme, ''To Far Away Times''<U+2014>to inspiring dreams.<ref name="mitsuda2008" /> He later attributed this song to an idea he was developing before ''Chrono Trigger'', reflecting that the song was made in dedication to "a certain person with whom I wanted to share a generation."<ref name="ctdsmitsudainterview" /> He also tried to use [[leitmotif]]s of the ''Chrono Trigger'' main theme to create a sense of consistency in the soundtrack.<ref name="sekitopsx" /> Mitsuda wrote each song to be around two minutes long before repeating, unusual for Square's games at the time.<ref name="gamest" /> Mitsuda suffered a hard drive crash that lost around forty in-progress tracks.<ref name="famitsujuly2008">{{cite journal| year=2008 | journal=[[Famitsu]] | title=Chrono Trigger DS | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/July_2008_Weekly_Famitsu_Interview_with_Yasunori_Mitsuda.html   | pages=&nbsp;67<U+2013>70 | language=Japanese}}</ref> After Mitsuda contracted [[Peptic ulcer|stomach ulcers]], Uematsu joined the project to compose ten songs and finish the score.<ref name="powerup">{{Cite book | year=2004 | first=Chris |last=Kohler |authorlink=Chris Kohler | title=[[Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life]] | publisher=DK Publishing  | isbn=0-7440-0424-1}}</ref> Mitsuda returned to watch the ending with the staff before the game's release, crying upon seeing the finished scene.<ref name="famitsujuly2008" />

At the time of the game's release, the number of tracks and sound effects was unprecedented<U+2014>the soundtrack spanned three discs in its 1995 commercial pressing.<ref name="npreview1" /> Square also released a one-disc [[acid jazz]] arrangement called "''[[The Brink of Time]]''" by [[Guido (jazz band)|Guido]] that year. ''The Brink of Time'' came about because Mitsuda wanted to do something that no one else was doing, and he noted that acid jazz and its related genres were uncommon in the Japanese market.<ref name="sekitopsx" /> Mitsuda considers ''Chrono Trigger'' a landmark title which helped mature his talent.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://palgn.com.au/5478/yasunori-mitsuda-interview/ |title=Yasunori Mitsuda Interview |accessdate=2007-05-22 | first=James |last=Gay | date=October 13, 2006 | publisher=PALGN}}</ref> While Mitsuda later held that the title piece was "rough around the edges," he maintains that it had "significant influence on my life as a composer."<ref name="ctdsmitsudainterview" /> In 1999, Square produced another one-disc soundtrack to complement the PlayStation release of ''Trigger'', featuring [[orchestra]]l tracks used in [[cut scene]]s.

To be perfectly honest, I find it so hard to believe that songs from 13 years ago are loved this much. Keeping these feelings in mind, I hope to continue composing songs which are powerful, and yet intricate...I hope that the extras like this bonus CD will help expand the world of Chrono Trigger, especially since we did a live recording. I hope there's another opportunity to release an album of this sort one day.<ref name="ctdsmitsudainterview" />}}

==Legacy==
===Add-ons===
''Chrono Trigger'' inspired several related releases; the first were three titles released for the [[Satellaview]] in 1995.

And, so it kind of all ended up fitting together."<ref>{{cite web | title=Square: Obsidian Would Like To Work On Chrono Trigger | url=http://www.siliconera.com/2010/07/06/obsidian-would-like-to-work-on-chrono-trigger/| accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Square: Obsidian wants to make Chrono Trigger| url=http://www.destructoid.com/obsidian-wants-to-make-chrono-trigger-178305.phtml| accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>
