'''Ernest Miller Hemingway''' (July 21, 1899&nbsp;<U+2013> July 2, 1961) was an American author and journalist. His economical and [[iceberg theory|understated]] style had a strong influence on [[20th century in literature|20th-century fiction]], while his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1954. He published seven novels, six short story collections, and two non-fiction works. Three novels, four collections of short stories, and three non-fiction works were published posthumously. Many of these are considered classics of [[American literature]].

Hemingway was raised in [[Oak Park, Illinois]]. After high school he reported for a few months for ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'', before leaving for the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian front]] to enlist with the [[List of ambulance drivers during World War I|World War&nbsp;I ambulance drivers]]. In 1918, he was seriously wounded and returned home. His wartime experiences formed the basis for his novel ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]''. In 1921 he married [[Hadley Richardson]], the first of his four wives. The couple moved to Paris, where he worked as a [[Correspondent|foreign correspondent]], and fell under the influence of the [[modernism|modernist]] writers and artists of the 1920s "[[Lost Generation]]" expatriate community. ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'', Hemingway's first novel, was published in 1926.

After his 1927 divorce from Hadley Richardson, Hemingway married [[Pauline Pfeiffer]]. They divorced after he returned from the [[Spanish Civil War]] where he had been a journalist, and after which he wrote ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]''. [[Martha Gellhorn]] became his third wife in 1940. They separated when he met [[Mary Welsh Hemingway|Mary Welsh]] in London during [[World War II]]. He was present at the [[Normandy Landings]] and the [[liberation of Paris]].

Shortly after the publication of ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'' in 1952, Hemingway went on safari to Africa, where he was almost killed in two successive plane crashes that left him in pain or ill health for much of the rest of his life. Hemingway had permanent residences in [[Key West, Florida]] (1930s), and [[Cuba]] (1940s and 1950s). In 1959 he bought a house in [[Ketchum, Idaho]], where he committed [[suicide]] in the summer of 1961.

=== Early life ===
[[File:ErnestHemingwayBabyPicture.jpg|thumb|right|Ernest Hemingway was the second child, and first son, born to Clarence and Grace Hemingway.|alt= an infant dressed in light colored clothing propped on a chair faces the camera]]

Ernest Miller Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899, in [[Oak Park, Illinois]], a suburb of Chicago.<ref>Oliver (1999), 140</ref> His father, Clarence Edmonds Hemingway was a physician, and his mother, Grace Hall-Hemingway, was a musician. Both were well-educated and well-respected in the conservative community of Oak Park,<ref name = "Reynolds pp 17-18"/> a community about which resident  [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] said, "So many churches for so many good people to go to".<ref>Meyers (1985), 4</ref> For a short period after their marriage,<ref>Oliver (1999), 134</ref> Clarence and Grace Hemingway lived with Grace's father, Ernest Hall, who eventually became their first son's namesake.<ref group=note>Hemingway had five siblings: Marcelline (1898); Ursula (1902); Madelaine (1904); Carol (1911); and Leicester (1915). See Reynolds (2000), 17<U+2013>18</ref> Later Ernest Hemingway would say he disliked his name, which he "associated with the naive, even foolish hero of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s play ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''".<ref name="Meyers p8">Meyers (1985), 8</ref> The family eventually moved into a  seven-bedroom home in a respectable neighborhood with a music studio for Grace and a medical office for Clarence.<ref name = "Reynolds pp 17-18">Reynolds (2000), 17<U+2013>18</ref>

Hemingway's mother frequently performed in concerts around the village. As an adult, Hemingway professed to hate his mother, although biographer [[Michael S. Reynolds]] points out that Hemingway mirrored her energy and enthusiasm.<ref name="Reynolds 2000 19">Reynolds (2000), 19</ref> Her insistence that he learn to play the cello became a "source of conflict", but he later admitted the music lessons were useful to his writing, as is evident in the "[[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] structure" of ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]''.<ref>Meyers (1985), 3</ref> The family owned a summer home called [[Ernest Hemingway Cottage|Windemere]] on [[Walloon Lake]], near [[Petoskey]], Michigan, where as a four-year-old his father taught him to hunt, fish and camp in the woods and lakes of Northern Michigan. His early experiences in nature instilled a passion for outdoor adventure and living in remote or isolated areas.<ref name = "Beegel2000, p. 63-70">Beegel (2000), 63-71</ref>

[[File:Ernest Hemingway with Family, 1905.png|thumb|left|Photograph of Hemingway family in 1905, from left: Marcelline, Sunny, Clarence, Grace, Ursula and Ernest]]

From 1913 until 1917, Hemingway attended [[Oak Park and River Forest High School]] where he took part in a number of sports, namely boxing, track and field, water polo and football. He excelled in English classes,<ref>Mellow (1992), 21</ref> and performed in the school orchestra with his sister Marcelline for two years.<ref name="Reynolds 2000 19"/> In his junior year, he took a journalism class, taught by Fannie Biggs, which was structured "as though the classroom were a newspaper office". The better writers in class submitted pieces to ''The Trapeze'', the school newspaper. Hemingway and Marcelline both had pieces submitted to ''The Trapeze''; Hemingway's first piece, published in January&nbsp;1916,  was about a local performance by the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]].<ref>Griffin (1985), 25</ref> He continued to contribute to and to edit the ''Trapeze'' and the ''Tabula'' (the school's newspaper and yearbook), for which he imitated the language of sportswriters, and used the pen name Ring Lardner, Jr.<U+2014>a nod to [[Ring Lardner]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' whose byline was "Line O'Type". Like [[Mark Twain]], [[Stephen Crane]], [[Theodore Dreiser]] and [[Sinclair Lewis]], Hemingway was a journalist before becoming a novelist; after leaving high school he went to work for ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' as a cub reporter.<ref name="Meyers p19ff">Meyers (1985), 19<U+2013>23</ref> Although he stayed there for only six months he relied on the ''Star'''s [[style guide]] as a foundation for his writing: "Use short sentences. Use short first paragraphs. Use vigorous English. Be positive, not negative."<ref>[http://www.kcstar.com/hemingway/ehstarstyle.shtml "Star style and rules for writing"]. ''[[The Kansas City Star]]''.

=== World War I ===
[[File:Ernest Hemingway in Milan 1918 retouched 3.jpg|thumb|Milan, 1918, Hemingway in uniform. He drove ambulances for two months until he was wounded.|alt=young man dressed in a uniform sitting on a chair facing the camera]]

Early in 1918 Hemingway responded to a [[Red Cross]] recruitment effort in Kansas City and signed on to become an ambulance driver in Italy.<ref>Mellow (1992), 48<U+2013>49</ref> He left New York in May, and arrived in Paris as the city was under bombardment from German artillery.<ref name="Meyers p27ff">Meyers (1985), 27<U+2013>31</ref> By June he was at the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian Front]]. It was probably around this time that he first met [[John Dos Passos]], with whom he had a rocky relationship for decades.<ref>Pizer (1986)</ref> On his first day in Milan he was sent to the scene of a munitions factory explosion where rescuers retrieved the shredded remains of female workers. He described the incident in his non-fiction book ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]'': "I remember that after we searched quite thoroughly for the complete dead we collected fragments".<ref name = "Mellow57ff">Mellow (1992), 57<U+2013>60</ref> A few days later he was stationed at [[Fossalta di Piave]].

On July&nbsp;8 he was seriously wounded by mortar fire, having just returned from the canteen bringing chocolate and cigarettes for the men at the front line.<ref name = "Mellow57ff">Mellow (1992), 57<U+2013>60</ref> Despite his wounds, Hemingway carried an Italian soldier to safety, for which he received the [[Silver Medal of Military Valor|Italian Silver Medal of Bravery]].<ref name="Meyers p27ff"/> Still only 18, Hemingway said of the incident: "When you go to war as a boy you have a great illusion of immortality. Other people get killed; not you&nbsp;... Then when you are badly wounded the first time you lose that illusion and you know it can happen to you."<ref name = "Putnam">Putnam, Thomas. [http://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2006/spring/hemingway.html "Hemingway on War and Its Aftermath"]. ''The National Archives''. Retrieved November 30, 2011</ref> He sustained severe shrapnel wounds to both legs, underwent an immediate operation at a distribution center and spent five days at a field hospital before he was transferred for recuperation to the Red Cross hospital in Milan.<ref name="Desnoyers p3">Desnoyers, 3</ref> He spent six months at the hospital where he met and formed a strong friendship with [[Eric Dorman-Smith|"Chink" Dorman-Smith]] that lasted for decades, and shared a room with future American [[foreign service officer]], ambassador, and author [[Henry Serrano Villard]].<ref>Meyers (1985), 37-42, 34</ref>

While recuperating he fell in love for the first time, with [[Agnes von Kurowsky]], a Red Cross nurse seven years his senior. By the time of his release and return to the United States in January&nbsp;1919, Agnes and Hemingway had decided to marry within a few months in America. However in March she wrote that she had become engaged to an Italian officer. Biographer Jeffrey Meyers claims Hemingway was devastated by Agnes' rejection, and that he followed a pattern of abandoning a wife before she abandoned him in future relationships.<ref name="Meyers p37ff">Meyers (1985), 37-42</ref>

=== Toronto and Chicago ===
Hemingway returned home early in 1919 to a time of readjustment. At not yet 20 years old, the war had created in him a maturity at odds with living at home without a job and the need for recuperation.<ref name="Meyers45ff">Meyers (1985), 45<U+2013>53</ref> As Reynolds explains, "Hemingway could not really tell his parents what he thought when he saw his bloody knee. He could not say how scared he was in another country with surgeons who could not tell him in English if his leg was coming off or not."<ref>Reynolds (1998), 21</ref> In September he took a fishing and camping trip with high school friends, to the back-country of Michigan's [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]].<ref name = "Putnam"/> The trip became the inspiration for his short story "[[Big Two-Hearted River]]", in which the [[Autobiographical novel|semi-autobiographical]] character [[Nick Adams (character)|Nick Adams]] takes to the country to find solitude after returning from war.<ref>Mellow (1992), 101</ref> A family friend offered him a job in [[Toronto]] and with nothing else to do he accepted. Late that year he began as a freelancer, staff writer and foreign correspondent for the ''Toronto Star Weekly''.  He returned to Michigan the following June,<ref name="Meyers45ff"/> and then moved to [[Chicago]] in September&nbsp;1920 to live with friends, while still filing stories for the ''[[Toronto Star]]''.<ref name="Meyers pp56-59"/>

In Chicago he worked as an associate editor of the monthly journal ''Cooperative Commonwealth'', where he met novelist [[Sherwood Anderson]].<ref name="Meyers pp56-59">Meyers (1985), 56<U+2013>58</ref> When St. Louis native [[Hadley Richardson]] came to Chicago to visit the sister of Hemingway's roommate, he became infatuated and  later claimed, "I knew she was the girl I was going to marry".<ref name="Kert pp83-90"/> Hadley was red-haired, with a "nurturing instinct", and eight years older than Hemingway.<ref name="Kert pp83-90"/> Despite the difference in age, Hadley, who had grown up with an overprotective mother, seemed less mature than usual for a young woman her age.<ref name="Oliver p139">Oliver (1999), 139</ref> Bernice Kert, author of ''The Hemingway Women'', claims Hadley was "evocative" of Agnes, but that Hadley had a childishness that Agnes lacked. The two corresponded for a few months, and then decided to marry and travel to Europe.<ref name="Kert pp83-90">Kert (1983), 83<U+2013>90</ref> They wanted to visit Rome, but Sherwood Anderson convinced them to visit Paris instead, writing letters of introduction for the young couple.<ref name="Baker 1972 pp7">Baker (1972), 7</ref> They were married on September&nbsp;3, 1921; two months later Hemingway was hired as foreign correspondent for the ''Toronto Star'' and the couple left for Paris. Of Hemingway's marriage to Hadley, Meyers claims: "With Hadley, Hemingway achieved everything he had hoped for with Agnes: the love of a beautiful woman, a comfortable income, a life in Europe."<ref name="Meyers pp60<U+2013>62">Meyers (1985), 60<U+2013>62</ref>

=== Paris ===
[[File:Ernest Hemingway 1923 passport photo.TIF.jpg|thumb|right|Hemingway's 1923 passport photo. At this time he lived in Paris with his wife Hadley, and worked as a journalist.|alt=front face view of a young man]]

[[Carlos Baker]], Hemingway's first biographer, believes that while Anderson suggested Paris because "the monetary exchange rate" made it an inexpensive place to live, more importantly it was where "the most interesting people in the world" lived. In Paris Hemingway met writers such as [[Gertrude Stein]], [[James Joyce]] and [[Ezra Pound]] who "could help a young writer up the rungs of a career".<ref name="Baker 1972 pp7"/> The Hemingway of the early Paris years was a "tall, handsome, muscular, broad-shouldered, brown-eyed, rosy-cheeked, square-jawed, soft-voiced young man."<ref name="Meyers pp70<U+2013>74"/> He and Hadley lived in a small walk-up at 74 rue du Cardinal Lemoine <!-- please do not change the spelling of the street name; should be lower case --> in the [[Latin Quarter]], and he worked in a rented room in a nearby building.<ref name="Baker 1972 pp7"/>  Stein, who was the bastion of [[modernism]] in Paris,<ref>Mellow (1991), 8</ref> became Hemingway's mentor; she introduced him to the expatriate artists and writers of the [[Montparnasse Quarter]], whom she referred to as the "[[Lost Generation]]"<U+2014>a term Hemingway popularized with the publication of ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]''.<ref name="Mellow p308">Mellow (1992), 308</ref> A regular at Stein's [[Salon (gathering)|salon]], Hemingway met influential painters such as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Joan Mir<U+00F3>]], and [[Juan Gris]].<ref name="Reynolds 2000 28">Reynolds (2000), 28</ref> He eventually withdrew from Stein's influence and their relationship deteriorated into a literary quarrel that spanned decades.<ref name="Meyers pp77<U+2013>81">Meyers (1985), 77<U+2013>81</ref> The American poet Ezra Pound met Hemingway by chance at Sylvia Beach's bookshop [[Shakespeare and Company (bookshop)|Shakespeare and Company]] in 1922.

During his first 20 months in Paris, Hemingway filed 88 stories for the ''Toronto Star'' newspaper.<ref>Reynolds (2000), 24</ref> He covered the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919<U+2013>1922)|Greco-Turkish War]], where he witnessed the burning of [[Smyrna]] and wrote travel pieces such as "Tuna Fishing in Spain" and "Trout Fishing All Across Europe: Spain Has the Best, Then Germany".<ref name="Desnoyers p5">Desnoyers, 5</ref> Hemingway was devastated on learning that Hadley had lost a suitcase filled with his manuscripts at the [[Paris-Gare de Lyon|Gare de Lyon]] as she was traveling to [[Geneva]] to meet him in December&nbsp;1922.<ref name="Meyers pp69<U+2013>70">Meyers (1985), 69<U+2013>70</ref> The following September, the couple returned to Toronto, where their son [[Jack Hemingway|John Hadley Nicanor]] was born on October 10, 1923. During their absence Hemingway's first book, ''[[Three Stories and Ten Poems]]'', was published. Two of the stories it contained were all that remained after the loss of the suitcase, and the third had been written the previous spring in Italy. Within months a second volume, ''in our time'' (without capitals), was published. The small volume included six [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]] and a dozen stories Hemingway had written the previous summer during his first visit to Spain where he discovered the thrill of the ''corrida''. He missed Paris, considered Toronto boring, and wanted to return to the life of a writer, rather than live the life of a journalist.<ref name="Baker 1972 15<U+2013>18">Baker (1972), 15<U+2013>18</ref>

Hemingway, Hadley and their son (nicknamed Bumby) returned to Paris in January&nbsp;1924 and moved into a new apartment on the rue Notre-Dame des Champs.<ref name="Baker 1972 15<U+2013>18"/> Hemingway helped [[Ford Madox Ford]] edit the ''[[transatlantic review]]'', which published works by Pound, [[John Dos Passos]], [[Baroness Elsa|Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]], and Stein, as well as some of Hemingway's own early stories such as "[[Indian Camp]]".<ref name="Meyers p126">Meyers (1985), 126</ref> When ''[[In Our Time (book)|In Our Time]]'' (with capital letters) was published in 1925, the dust jacket bore comments from Ford.<ref>Baker (1972), 34</ref><ref name="Meyers p127">Meyers (1985), 127</ref> "Indian Camp" received considerable praise; Ford saw it as an important early story by a young writer,<ref>Mellow (1992), 236</ref> and critics in the United States praised Hemingway for reinvigorating the short story genre with his crisp style and use of declarative sentences.<ref>Mellow (1992), 314</ref> Six months earlier, Hemingway had met [[F.

With his wife [[Hadley Richardson|Hadley]], Hemingway first visited the Festival of [[San Ferm<U+00ED>n]] in [[Pamplona]], Spain in 1923, where he became fascinated by [[bullfighting]].<ref name="Meyers pp117-119">Meyers (1985), 117<U+2013>119</ref> The Hemingways returned to Pamplona in 1924 and a third time in June&nbsp;1925; that year they brought with them a group of American and British expatriates: Hemingway's [[Michigan]] boyhood friend Bill Smith, Stewart, [[Duff Twysden|Lady Duff Twysden]] (recently divorced), her lover Pat Guthrie, and [[Harold Loeb]].<ref name="Nagel89ff">Nagel (1996), 89</ref> A few days after the fiesta ended, on his birthday (21&nbsp;July), he began to write the draft of what would become ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'', finishing eight weeks later.<ref name="Meyers p189">Meyers (1985), 189</ref>  A few months later, in December 1925, the Hemingways left to spend the winter in [[Schruns]], Austria, where Hemingway began revising the manuscript extensively. [[Pauline Pfeiffer]] joined them in January and against Hadley's advice urged him to sign a contract with [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner's]]. He left Austria for a quick trip to New York to meet with the publishers, and on his return, during a stop in Paris,  began an affair with Pauline, before returning to Schruns to finish the revisions in March.<ref>Reynolds (1989), vi<U+2013>vii</ref>  The manuscript arrived in New York in April,  he corrected the final proof in Paris in August&nbsp;1926,  and Scribner's published the novel in October.<ref name="Meyers p189">Meyers (1985), 189</ref><ref>Mellow (1992), 328</ref><ref name="Baker p44">Baker (1972), 44</ref>

''The Sun Also Rises'' epitomized the post-war expatriate generation,<ref name="Mellow p302">Mellow (1992), 302</ref> received good reviews, and is "recognized as Hemingway's greatest work".<ref name="Meyers p192">Meyers (1985), 192</ref> Hemingway himself later wrote to his editor [[Max Perkins]] that the "point of the book" was not so much about a generation being lost, but that "the earth abideth forever"; he believed the characters in ''The Sun Also Rises'' may have been "battered" but were not lost.<ref name="Baker p82">Baker (1972), 82</ref>

Hemingway's marriage to Hadley deteriorated as he was working on ''The Sun Also Rises''.<ref name="Baker p44"/> In the spring of 1926, Hadley became aware of his affair with Pauline Pfeiffer, who came to Pamplona with them that July.<ref name="Baker p43">Baker (1972), 43</ref><ref>Mellow (1992), 333</ref> On their return to Paris, Hadley asked for a separation; in November she formally requested a divorce. They split their possessions while Hadley accepted Hemingway's offer of the proceeds from ''The Sun Also Rises''.<ref>Mellow (1992), 338<U+2013>340</ref> The couple were divorced in January&nbsp;1927, and Hemingway married Pauline Pfeiffer in May.<ref name="Meyers p172">Meyers (1985), 172</ref>
[[File:Ernest and Pauline Hemingway, Paris, 1927.jpg|right|thumb|Ernest and Pauline Hemingway in Paris, 1927]]
Pfeiffer, who was from a wealthy Catholic [[Arkansas]] family, had moved to  Paris to work for ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine. Before their marriage Hemingway converted to Catholicism.<ref>Meyers (1985), 173, 184</ref> They  honeymooned in [[Le Grau-du-Roi]], where he contracted [[anthrax]], and he planned his next collection of short stories,<ref>Mellow (1992), 348<U+2013>353</ref> ''[[Men Without Women (short story collection)|Men Without Women]]'', published in October 1927.<ref name="Meyers p195">Meyers (1985), 195</ref> By the end of the year Pauline, who was pregnant, wanted to move back to America. John Dos Passos recommended [[Key West]], and they left Paris in March&nbsp;1928. That spring Hemingway suffered a severe injury in their Paris bathroom, when he pulled a skylight down on his head thinking he was pulling on a toilet chain. This left him with a prominent forehead scar, which he carried for the rest of his life. When Hemingway was asked about the scar he was reluctant to answer.<ref>Robinson (2005)</ref> After his departure from Paris, Hemingway "never again lived in a big city".<ref name="Meyers p204">Meyers (1985), 204</ref>

=== Key West and the Caribbean ===
In the late spring Hemingway and Pauline traveled to Kansas City, where their son [[Patrick Hemingway|Patrick]] was born on June&nbsp;28, 1928. Pauline had a difficult delivery, which Hemingway fictionalized in ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]''. After Patrick's birth, Pauline and Hemingway traveled to Wyoming, Massachusetts and New York.<ref name="Meyers p208">Meyers (1985), 208</ref> In the winter he was in New York with Bumby, about to board a train to Florida, when he received a cable telling him that his father had committed suicide.<ref group=note>Clarence Hemingway used his father's Civil War pistol to shoot himself. See Meyers (1985), 2</ref><ref>Mellow (1992), 367</ref> Hemingway was devastated, having earlier sent a letter to his father telling him not to worry about financial difficulties; the letter arrived minutes after the suicide. He realized how Hadley must have felt after her own father's suicide in 1903, and he commented, "I'll probably go the same way."<ref>qtd. in Meyers (1985), 210</ref>

Upon his return to Key West in December, Hemingway worked on the draft of ''A Farewell to Arms'' before leaving for France in January. He had finished it in August but delayed the revision. The serialization in ''[[Scribner's Magazine]]'' was scheduled to begin in May, but as late as April, Hemingway was still working on the ending, which he may have rewritten as many as seventeen times. The completed novel was published on September&nbsp;27.<ref name="Meyers p215">Meyers (1985), 215</ref> Biographer James Mellow believes ''A Farewell to Arms'' established Hemingway's stature as a major American writer and displayed a level of complexity not apparent in ''The Sun Also Rises''.<ref name="Mellow p378">Mellow (1992), 378</ref> In Spain during the summer of 1929, Hemingway researched his next work, ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]''. He wanted to write a comprehensive [[treatise]] on bullfighting, explaining the ''toreros'' and ''corridas'' and complete with glossaries and appendices, because he believed bullfighting was "of great tragic interest, being literally of life and death."<ref>Baker (1972), 144<U+2013>145</ref>

During the early 1930s Hemingway spent his winters in Key West and summers in Wyoming, where he found "the most beautiful country he had seen in the American West" where he hunted deer, elk and grizzly bear.<ref name="Meyers p222">Meyers (1985), 222</ref> He was joined there by Dos Passos and in November 1930, after bringing Dos Passos to the train station in [[Billings, Montana|Billings]], Hemingway broke his arm in a car accident. The surgeon tended the compound spiral fracture and bound together the bone with kangaroo tendon.

In 1933 Hemingway and Pauline went on safari to East Africa. The 10-week trip provided material for ''[[Green Hills of Africa]]'', as well as for the short stories "[[The Snows of Kilimanjaro (story)|The Snows of Kilimanjaro]]" and "[[The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber]]".<ref name="Desnoyers p9">Desnoyers, 9</ref> The couple visited [[Mombasa]], [[Nairobi]], and [[Machakos]] in [[Kenya]], then moved on to [[Tanganyika]], where they hunted in the [[Serengeti]], around [[Lake Manyara]], and west and southeast of present-day [[Tarangire National Park]].

During these travels Hemingway contracted [[amoebic dysentery]] that caused a prolapsed intestine, and he was evacuated by plane to Nairobi, an experience reflected in "The Snows of Kilimanjaro". On Hemingway's return to Key West in early 1934, he began work on ''Green Hills of Africa'', which he published in 1935 to mixed reviews.<ref>Mellow (1992), 337<U+2013>340</ref>

In 1937 Hemingway agreed to report on the [[Spanish Civil War]] for the [[North American Newspaper Alliance]] (NANA),<ref name="Mellow p488">Mellow (1992), 488</ref> arriving  in Spain  in March with Dutch filmmaker [[Joris Ivens]].<ref name="Koch p87">Koch (2005), 87</ref> Ivens, who was filming ''[[The Spanish Earth]]'', wanted Hemingway to replace  John Dos Passos as screenwriter, since Dos Passos had left the project when his friend [[Jos<U+00E9> Robles]] was arrested and later executed.<ref name="Meyers p311">Meyers (1985), 311</ref> The incident changed Dos Passos' opinion of the leftist republicans, creating a rift between him and Hemingway, who later spread a rumor that Dos Passos left Spain out of cowardice.<ref name="Koch p164">Koch (2005), 164</ref>

Journalist and writer [[Martha Gellhorn]], whom Hemingway had met in Key West the previous Christmas (1936), joined him in Spain. Like Hadley, Martha was a native of St. Louis, and like Pauline, she had worked for ''Vogue'' in Paris. Of Martha, Kert explains, "she never catered to him the way other women did."<ref name="Kert pp287">Kert (1983), 287<U+2013>295</ref> Late in 1937, while in Madrid with Martha, Hemingway wrote his only play, ''[[The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories|The Fifth Column]]'', as the city was being bombarded.<ref name="Koch p134">Koch (2005), 134</ref> He returned to Key West for a few months, then back to Spain twice in 1938 where he was present at the [[Battle of the Ebro]], the last republican stand, and was among the British and American journalists who were some of the last to leave the battle as they crossed the river.<ref name="Meyers p321">Meyers (1985), 321</ref><ref name = "Thomas p833">Thomas (2001), 833</ref>

In the spring of 1939, Hemingway crossed to Cuba in his boat to live in the [[Hotel Ambos Mundos]] in Havana.  This was the separation phase of a slow and painful split from Pauline, which had begun when Hemingway met Martha.<ref name="Meyers p326">Meyers (1985), 326</ref> Martha soon joined him in Cuba, and they almost immediately rented "[[Finca Vigia]]" ("Lookout Farm"), a {{convert|15|acre|m2|adj=on}} property {{convert|15|mi|km}} from Havana. Pauline and the children left Hemingway that summer, after the family was reunited during a visit to Wyoming. After Hemingway's divorce from Pauline was finalized, he and Martha were married November 20, 1940, in Cheyenne, Wyoming.<ref>Lynn (1987), 479</ref> As he had after his divorce from Hadley, he changed locations, moving his primary summer residence to [[Ketchum, Idaho]], just outside the newly built resort of [[Sun Valley, Idaho|Sun Valley]], and his winter residence to Cuba.<ref name="Meyers p342">Meyers (1985), 342</ref>  Hemingway, who had been disgusted when a Parisian friend allowed his cats to eat from the table, became enamored of cats in Cuba, keeping dozens of them on the property.<ref name="Meyers p353">Meyers (1985), 353</ref>

Gellhorn inspired him to write his most famous novel, ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]],'' which he started in March 1939 and finished in July 1940. It was published in October 1940.<ref name="Meyers p334">Meyers (1985), 334</ref> Consistent with his pattern of moving around while working on a manuscript, he wrote ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'' in Cuba, Wyoming, and Sun Valley.<ref name="Meyers p326"/> ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'' became a Book-of-the-Month Club choice, sold half a million copies within months, was nominated for a [[Pulitzer Prize]], and as Meyers describes it, "triumphantly re-established Hemingway's literary reputation".<ref name="Meyers pp334<U+2013>339">Meyers (1985), 334<U+2013>338</ref>

In January&nbsp;1941 Martha was sent to China on assignment for ''[[Collier's]]'' magazine. Hemingway went with her, sending in dispatches for the newspaper ''[[PM (newspaper)|PM]]'', but in general he disliked China.<ref name="Meyers pp=356<U+2013>361">Meyers (1985), 356<U+2013>361</ref> They returned to Cuba before the [[declaration of war by the United States]]  that December when he convinced the Cuban government to help him refit the ''Pilar'', which he intended to use to ambush German submarines off the coast of Cuba.<ref name="Putnam"/>

From May&nbsp;1944 to March&nbsp;1945 Hemingway was in London and Europe. When Hemingway first arrived in London he met ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine correspondent Mary Welsh, with whom he became infatuated; on their third meeting he asked her to marry him. Martha, who had been forced to cross the Atlantic in a ship filled with explosives because he refused to help her get a press pass on a plane, arrived in London to find Hemingway hospitalized with a [[concussion]] from a car accident. Unsympathetic to his plight, she accused him of being a bully, and told him she was "through, absolutely finished."<ref name="Kert pp393-398">Kert (1983), 393<U+2013>398</ref> The last time he saw Martha was in March&nbsp;1945 as he was preparing to return to Cuba.<ref name="Meyers p416">Meyers (1985), 416</ref> Meanwhile, he had asked Mary Welsh to marry him on their third meeting.<ref name ="Kert pp393-398"/>

Hemingway, wearing a large head bandage, was present at the [[Normandy Landings|D-Day]] landing, although he was kept on a landing craft because military officials considered him "precious cargo",<ref name="Meyers pp398-405">Meyers (1985), 398<U+2013>405</ref> although biographer Kenneth Lynn claims he fabricated accounts that he went ashore during the landings.<ref>Lynn (1987), 510</ref> Late in July he attached himself to "the [[22nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|22nd Infantry Regiment]] commanded by [[Charles T. Lanham|Col. Charles 'Buck' Lanham]], as it drove toward Paris", and Hemingway became de facto leader to a small band of village militia in [[Rambouillet]] outside of Paris.<ref name="Meyers pp398-405"/> Of Hemingway's exploits, World War&nbsp;II historian Paul Fussell remarks: "Hemingway got into considerable trouble playing infantry captain to a group of Resistance people that he gathered because a correspondent is not supposed to lead troops, even if he does it well".<ref name="Putnam"/> This was in fact in contravention of the [[Geneva Convention]], and Hemingway was brought up on formal charges; he said he "beat the rap" by claiming that he only offered advice.<ref name="Lynn 1987 518<U+2013>519">Lynn (1987), 518<U+2013>519</ref>

On August&nbsp;25 he was present at the [[liberation of Paris]], although contrary to the Hemingway legend, he was not the first into the city, nor did he liberate the Ritz.<ref name="Meyers p408ff">Meyers (1985) 408<U+2013>411</ref> In Paris he did, however, attend a reunion hosted by Sylvia Beach, where he "made peace with" Gertrude Stein.<!-- who else was at this? --><ref name="Mellow p535ff">Mellow (1992), 535<U+2013>540</ref> Later that year he was present at heavy  fighting in the [[Battle of H<U+00FC>rtgen Forest]].<ref name="Meyers p408ff"/> On December&nbsp;17, 1944 a feverish and ill Hemingway had himself driven to [[Luxembourg]] to cover what would later be called [[The Battle of the Bulge]]. As soon as he arrived, however, Lanham handed him to the doctors, who hospitalized him with pneumonia; by the time he recovered a week later, most of the fighting in this battle was over.<ref name="Lynn 1987 518<U+2013>519"/>

In 1947 Hemingway was awarded a [[Bronze Star]] for his bravery during World War&nbsp;II. He was recognized for his valor, having been "under fire in combat areas in order to obtain an accurate picture of conditions," with the commendation that "through his talent of expression, Mr. Hemingway enabled readers to obtain a vivid picture of the difficulties and triumphs of the front-line soldier and his organization in combat."<ref name="Putnam"/>

=== Cuba and the Nobel Prize ===
Hemingway said he "was out of business as a writer" from 1942 to 1945.<ref name="Mellow p552">qtd. in Mellow (1992), 552</ref> In 1946 he married Mary, who had an [[ectopic pregnancy]] five months later. The Hemingway family suffered a series of accidents and health problems in the years following the war: in a 1945 car accident he "smashed his knee" and sustained another "deep wound on his forehead"; Mary broke first her right ankle and then her left in successive skiing accidents. A 1947 car accident left Patrick with a head wound and severely ill.<ref name="Meyers pp420<U+2013>421">Meyers (1985), 420<U+2013>421</ref> Hemingway sank into depression as his literary friends began to die: in 1939 [[W.

In 1948, Hemingway and Mary traveled to Europe, staying in [[Venice]] for several months. While there, Hemingway fell in love with the then 19-year-old [[Adriana Ivancich]]. The platonic love affair inspired the novel ''[[Across the River and Into the Trees]]'', written in Cuba during a time of strife with  Mary, and published in 1950 to negative reviews.<ref>Meyers (1985), 440<U+2013>452</ref> The following year, furious at the critical reception of ''Across the River and Into the Trees'', he wrote the draft of ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'' in eight weeks, saying that it was "the best I can write ever for all of my life".<ref name="Desnoyers p12"/> ''The Old Man and the Sea'' became a book-of-the-month selection, made Hemingway an international celebrity, and won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in May 1952, a month before he left for his second trip to Africa.<ref name = "Desnoyers p13">Desnoyers, 13</ref><ref name="Meyers p489">Meyers (1985), 489</ref>

In 1954, while in Africa, Hemingway was almost fatally injured in two successive plane crashes. He chartered a sightseeing flight over the [[Belgian Congo]] as a Christmas present to Mary. On their way to photograph [[Murchison Falls]] from the air, the plane struck an abandoned utility pole and "crash landed in heavy brush." Hemingway's injuries included a head wound, while Mary broke two ribs.<ref>Baker (1972), 331<U+2013>333</ref> The next day, attempting to reach medical care in [[Entebbe]], they boarded a second plane that exploded at take-off, with Hemingway suffering burns and another concussion, this one serious enough to cause leaking of [[cerebrospinal fluid|cerebral fluid]].<ref>Mellow (1992), 586</ref> They eventually arrived in Entebbe to find reporters covering the story of Hemingway's death. He briefed the reporters and spent the next few weeks recuperating and reading his erroneous obituaries.<ref>Mellow (1992), 587</ref> Despite his injuries, Hemingway accompanied Patrick and his wife on a planned fishing expedition in February, but pain caused him to be irascible and difficult to get along with.<ref name="Mellow 1992 588">Mellow (1992), 588</ref> When a bushfire broke out, he was again injured, sustaining second degree burns on his legs, front torso, lips, left hand and right forearm.<ref name="Meyers pp505-507">Meyers (1985), 505<U+2013>507</ref> Months later in [[Venice]], Mary reported to friends the full extent of Hemingway's injuries: two cracked [[Intervertebral disc|discs]], a kidney and liver rupture, a [[dislocated shoulder]] and a broken skull.<ref name="Mellow 1992 588"/> The accidents may have precipitated the physical deterioration that was to follow. After the plane crashes, Hemingway, who had been "a thinly controlled alcoholic throughout much of his life, drank more heavily than usual to combat the pain of his injuries."<ref>Beegel (1996), 273</ref>

In October&nbsp;1954 Hemingway received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. He modestly told the press that [[Carl Sandburg]], [[Isak Dinesen]] and [[Bernard Berenson]] deserved the prize,<ref>Lynn (1987), 574</ref> but the prize money would be welcome.<ref name="Baker p338">Baker (1972), 38</ref> Mellow claims Hemingway "had coveted the Nobel Prize", but when he won it, months after his plane accidents and the ensuing world-wide press coverage, "there must have been a lingering suspicion in Hemingway's mind that his obituary notices had played a part in the academy's decision."<ref name="Mellow pp588<U+2013>589">Mellow (1992), 588<U+2013>589</ref> Because he was suffering pain from the African accidents, he decided against traveling to [[Stockholm]].<ref name="Meyers p509">Meyers (1985), 509</ref> Instead he sent a speech to be read, defining the writer's life: "Writing, at its best, is a lonely life. Organizations for writers palliate the writer's loneliness but I doubt if they improve his writing. He grows in public stature as he sheds his loneliness and often his work deteriorates. For he does his work alone and if he is a good enough writer he must face eternity, or the lack of it, each day."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1954/hemingway-speech.html|title=Ernest Hemingway The Nobel Prize in Literature 1954 Banquet Speech |author= |date= |work= |publisher=The Nobel Foundation|accessdate=December 10, 2009}}</ref><ref group = note>The full speech is available at [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1954/hemingway-speech.html The Nobel Foundation]</ref>

From the end of the year in 1955 to early 1956, Hemingway was bedridden.<ref name="Meyers p512">Meyers (1985), 512</ref> He was told to stop drinking to mitigate liver damage, advice he initially followed but then disregarded.<ref>Reynolds (2000), 291<U+2013>293</ref> In October&nbsp;1956 he returned to Europe and met [[Basque people|Basque]] writer [[Pio Baroja]], who was seriously ill and died weeks later.

In November, while in Paris, he was reminded of trunks he had stored in the Ritz Hotel in 1928 and never retrieved. The trunks were filled with notebooks and writing from his Paris years. Excited about the discovery, when he returned to Cuba in 1957 he began to shape the recovered work into his memoir ''[[A Moveable Feast]]''.<ref name="Meyers p533">Meyers (1985), 533</ref> By 1959 he ended a period of intense activity: he finished ''A Moveable Feast'' (scheduled to be released the following year); brought ''True at First Light'' to 200,000 words; added chapters to ''The Garden of Eden''; and worked on ''Islands in the Stream''. The last three were stored in a safe deposit box in Havana, as he focused on the finishing touches for ''A Moveable Feast''. Reynolds claims it was during this period that Hemingway slid into depression, from which he was unable to recover.<ref>Reynolds (1999), 321</ref>

The Finca Vigia became crowded with guests and tourists, as Hemingway, beginning to become unhappy with life there, considered a permanent move to Idaho. In 1959 he bought a home overlooking the [[Big Wood River]], outside Ketchum, and left Cuba<U+2014>although he apparently remained on easy terms with the [[Fidel Castro|Castro]] government, telling the ''New York Times'' he was "delighted" with Castro's overthrow of [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]].<ref>Mellow (1992), 494<U+2013>495</ref><ref name="Meyers pp516<U+2013>519">Meyers (1985), 516<U+2013>519</ref> He was in Cuba in November 1959, between returning from Pamplona and traveling west to Idaho, and the following year for his birthday; however, that year he and Mary decided to leave after hearing the news that Castro wanted to nationalize property owned by Americans and other foreign nationals.<ref>Reynolds (2000), 332, 344</ref> In July 1960 the Hemingways left Cuba for the last time, leaving art and manuscripts in a bank vault in Havana. After the 1961 [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], the Finca Vigia was expropriated by the Cuban government, complete with Hemingway's collection of "four to six thousand books".<ref name="Mellow p599">Mellow (1992), 599</ref>

Hemingway continued to rework the material that would be published as ''A Moveable Feast'' through the end of the 1950s.<ref name="Meyers p533"/> In the summer of 1959 he visited Spain to research a series of bullfighting articles commissioned by ''[[Life Magazine]]'',<ref name="Meyers p520">Meyers (1985), 520</ref> returning to Cuba in January 1960 to work on the manuscript. ''Life'' only wanted 10,000&nbsp;words, but the manuscript grew out of control. For the first time in his life unable to organize his writing, he asked [[A. E. Hotchner]] to travel to Cuba to help. Hotchner helped him trim the ''Life'' piece to 40,000 words, and Scribner's agreed to a full-length book version (''[[The Dangerous Summer]]'') of almost 130,000 words.<ref name = "R544ff">Reynolds (1999), 544<U+2013>547</ref> Hotchner found Hemingway to be "unusually hesitant, disorganized, and confused",<ref name="Mellow pp598<U+2013>600">qtd. in Mellow (1992), 598<U+2013>600</ref> and he was suffering badly from failing eyesight.<ref name="Meyers p542-544">Meyers (1985), 542<U+2013>544</ref>

On July 25, 1960, Hemingway and Mary left Cuba, never to return. Hemingway then traveled alone to Spain to be photographed for the front cover of the current ''Life'' magazine piece. A few days later he was reported in the news to be seriously ill and on the verge of dying, which panicked Mary until she received a cable from him telling her, "Reports false. Enroute Madrid. Love Papa."<ref>qtd. in Reynolds (1999), 546</ref>  However, he was seriously ill and believed himself to be on the verge of a breakdown.<ref name = "R544ff"/> He was lonely and took to his bed for days, retreating into silence, despite the first installments of ''The Dangerous Summer'' being published in ''Life'' in September 1960 to good reviews.<ref name="Mellow pp598-601">Mellow (1992), 598<U+2013>601</ref> In October he left Spain for New York, where he refused to leave Mary's apartment on the pretext that he was being watched. She quickly took him out to Idaho, where George Saviers (a Sun Valley physician) met them at the train.<ref name = "R544ff"/>

At this time Hemingway was worried about money and about his safety.<ref name="Meyers p542-544"/> He worried about his taxes, and that he would never return to Cuba to retrieve the manuscripts he had left there in a bank vault. He became paranoid and thought the FBI was actively monitoring his movements in Ketchum.<ref name ="R548">Reynolds (1999), 548</ref><ref>Meyers (1985), 543</ref> The FBI had opened a file on him during World War II, when he used the Pilar to patrol the waters off Cuba, and [[J.

[[Henry Louis Gates]] believes Hemingway's style was fundamentally shaped "in reaction to [his] experience of world war". After World War&nbsp;I, he and other modernists "lost faith in the central institutions of Western civilization," by reacting against the elaborate style of 19th century writers and by creating a style "in which meaning is established through dialogue, through action, and silences<U+2014>a fiction in which nothing crucial<U+2014>or at least very little<U+2014>is stated explicitly."<ref name="Putnam"/>

Developing this connection between Hemingway and other modernist writers, [[Irene Gammel]] believes his style was carefully cultivated and honed with an eye toward the avant-garde of the era. Hungry for <U+201C>vanguard experimentation<U+201D> and rebelling against Ford Madox Ford<U+2019>s <U+201C>staid modernism,<U+201D> Hemingway published the work of Gertrude Stein and Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven in ''the transatlantic review''. As Gammel notes, Hemingway was <U+201C>introduced to the Baroness<U+2019>s experimental style during a time when he was actively trimming the verbal <U+2018>fat<U+2019> off his own style, as well as flexing his writer<U+2019>s muscles in assaulting conventional taste.<U+201D><ref>Gammel (2002), 363-64</ref>

Because he began as a writer of short stories, Baker believes Hemingway learned to "get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to multiply intensities and how to tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth."<ref name="Baker p117">Baker (1972),  117</ref> Hemingway called his style the [[Iceberg Theory|iceberg theory]]: the facts float above water; the supporting structure and symbolism operate out of sight.<ref name="Baker p117"/> The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the "theory of omission." Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing (such as Nick Adams fishing in "The Big Two-Hearted River") though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface (Nick Adams concentrating on fishing to the extent that he does not have to think about anything else).<ref>Oliver (1999), 321<U+2013>322</ref>

Jackson Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices about life in general<U+2014>not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with "what if" scenarios: "what if I were wounded in such a way that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?"<ref>Benson (1989), 351</ref>  Writing in "The Art of the Short Story," Hemingway explains: "A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit."<ref>Hemingway (1975), 3</ref>

The simplicity of the prose is deceptive. Zoe Trodd believes Hemingway crafted skeletal sentences in response to [[Henry James]]'s observation that World War&nbsp;I had "used up words." Hemingway offers a "multi-focal" photographic reality. His iceberg theory of omission is the foundation on which he builds. The syntax, which lacks [[grammatical conjunction|subordinating conjunctions]], creates static sentences. The photographic "[[Snapshot (photography)|snapshot]]" style creates a [[collage]] of images. Many types of internal punctuation (colons, semicolons, dashes, parentheses) are omitted in favor of short declarative sentences. The sentences build on each other, as events build to create a sense of the whole. Multiple strands exist in one story; an "embedded text" bridges to a different angle. He also uses other cinematic techniques of "cutting" quickly from one scene to the next; or of "splicing" a scene into another. Intentional omissions allow the reader to fill the gap, as though responding to instructions from the author, and create three-dimensional prose.<ref>Trodd (2007), 8</ref> <!-- Hemingway habitually used the word "and" in place of commas. This use of [[polysyndeton]] may serve to convey immediacy.

In his literature, and in his personal writing, Hemingway habitually used the word "and" in place of commas. This use of [[polysyndeton]] may serve to convey immediacy. Hemingway's polysyndetonic sentence<U+2014>or in later works his use of subordinate clauses<U+2014>uses conjunctions to juxtapose startling visions and images; Jackson Benson compares them to [[haiku]]s.<ref name="McCormick p49">McCormick, 49</ref><ref>Benson (1975), 309</ref> Many of Hemingway's followers misinterpreted his lead and frowned upon all expression of emotion; [[Saul Bellow]] satirized this style as "Do you have emotions? Strangle them."<ref>qtd. in Hoberek (2005), 309</ref> However, Hemingway's intent was not to eliminate emotion, but to portray it more scientifically. Hemingway thought it would be easy, and pointless, to describe emotions; he sculpted collages of images in order to grasp "the real thing, the sequence of motion and fact which made the emotion and which would be as valid in a year or in ten years or, with luck and if you stated it purely enough, always".<ref>Hemingway, Ernest. ''Death in the Afternoon''. New York: Simon and Schuster</ref> This use of an image as an [[objective correlative]] is characteristic of Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, and [[Proust]].<ref>McCormick, 47</ref> Hemingway's letters refer to Proust's ''[[In Search of Lost Time|Remembrance of Things Past]]'' several times over the years, and indicate he read the book at least twice.<ref name="Burwell p187">Burwell (1996), 187</ref>

== Themes ==
The popularity of Hemingway's work to a great extent is based on the themes, which according to scholar Frederic Svoboda are love, war, wilderness and loss, all of which are strongly evident in the body of work.<ref>Svoboda (2000), 155</ref> These are recurring themes of [[American literature]], which are clearly evident in Hemingway's work. Critic [[Leslie Fiedler]] sees the theme he defines as "The Sacred Land"<U+2014>the [[American Old West|American West]]<U+2014>extended in Hemingway's work to include mountains in Spain, Switzerland and Africa, and to the streams of Michigan. The American West is given a symbolic nod with the naming of the "Hotel Montana" in ''The Sun Also Rises'' and ''For Whom the Bell Tolls''.<ref name="Fiedler"/>  According to Stoltzfus and Fiedler, Hemingway's nature is a place for rebirth, for therapy, and the hunter or fisherman has a moment of transcendence when the prey is killed.<ref name="Stoltzfus"/> Nature is where men are without women: men fish; men hunt; men find redemption in nature.<ref name="Fiedler"/> Although Hemingway writes about sports, Carlos Baker believes the emphasis is more on the athlete than the sport,<ref name="Baker1972 101<U+2013>121">Baker (1972), 101<U+2013>121</ref> while Beegel sees the essence of Hemingway as an American [[naturalist]], as reflected in such detailed descriptions as can be found in "Big Two-Hearted River".<ref name = "Beegel2000, p. 63-70"/>

Fiedler believes Hemingway inverts the American literary theme of the evil "Dark Woman" versus the good "Light Woman". The dark woman<U+2014>Brett Ashley of ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]''<U+2014>is a goddess; the light woman<U+2014>Margot Macomber of "[[The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber]]"<U+2014>is a murderess.<ref name="Fiedler">Fiedler (1975), 345<U+2013>365</ref> [[Robert Scholes]] admits that early Hemingway stories, such as "[[A Very Short Story]]", present "a male character favorably and a female unfavorably."<ref>Scholes (1990),  42</ref>  According to Rena Sanderson, early Hemingway critics lauded his male-centric world of masculine pursuits, and the fiction divided women into "castrators or love-slaves." Feminist critics attacked Hemingway as "public enemy number one", although more recent re-evaluations of his work "have given new visibility to Hemingway's female characters (and their strengths) and have revealed his own sensitivity to gender issues, thus casting doubts on the old assumption that his writings were one-sidedly masculine."<ref>Sanderson (1996), 171</ref> Nina Baym believes that Brett Ashley and Margot Macomber "are the two outstanding examples of Hemingway's 'bitch women.'"<ref>Baym (1990), 112</ref>

The theme of women and death is evident in stories as early as "[[Indian Camp]]". The theme of death permeates Hemingway's work. Young believes the emphasis in "Indian Camp" was not so much on the woman who gives birth or the father who commits suicide, but on Nick Adams who witnesses these events as a child, and becomes a "badly scarred and nervous young man." Hemingway sets the events in "Indian Camp" that shape the Adams persona. Young believes "Indian Camp" holds the "master key" to "what its author was up to for some thirty-five years of his writing career." <ref>Young (1964), 6</ref> Stoltzfus considers Hemingway's work to be more complex with a representation of the truth inherent in [[existentialism]]: if "nothingness" is embraced, then redemption is achieved at the moment of death. Those who face death with dignity and courage live an authentic life. Francis Macomber dies happy because the last hours of his life are authentic; the [[bullfighter]] in the [[Bullfighting|corrida]] represents the pinnacle of a life lived with authenticity.<ref name="Stoltzfus">Stoltzfus (2005), 215<U+2013>218</ref> In his paper ''The Uses of Authenticity: Hemingway and the Literary Field'', Timo M<U+00FC>ller writes that Hemingway's fiction is successful because the characters live an "authentic life", and the "soldiers, fishers, boxers and backwoodsmen are among the archetypes of authenticity in modern literature".<ref>M<U+00FC>ller (2010), 31</ref>

The theme of emasculation is prevalent in Hemingway's work, most notably in ''The Sun Also Rises''. Emasculation, according to Fiedler, is a result of a generation of wounded soldiers; and of a generation in which women such as Brett gained [[Women's suffrage|emancipation]]. This also applies to the minor character, Frances Clyne, Cohn's girlfriend in the beginning in the book. Her character supports the theme not only because the idea was presented early on in the novel but also the impact she had on Cohn in the start of the book while only appearing a small number of times.<ref name="Fiedler"/> Baker believes Hemingway's work emphasizes the "natural" versus the "unnatural". In "Alpine Idyll" the "unnaturalness" of skiing in the high country late spring snow is juxtaposed against the "unnaturalness" of the peasant who allowed his wife's dead body to linger too long in the shed during the winter. The skiers and peasant retreat to the valley to the "natural" spring for redemption.<ref name="Baker1972 101<U+2013>121"/>

Some critics have characterized Hemingway's work as misogynistic and homophobic. Susan Beegel analyzed four decades of Hemingway criticism, published in her essay "Critical Reception". She found, particularly in the 1980s, "critics interested in multiculturalism" simply ignored Hemingway; although some "apologetics" have been written. Typical is this analysis of ''The Sun Also Rises'': "Hemingway never lets the reader forget that Cohn is a Jew, not an unattractive character who happens to be a Jew but a character who is unattractive because he is a Jew." During the same decade, according to Beegel, criticism was published that investigated the "horror of homosexuality", and racism in Hemingway's fiction.<ref>Beegel (1996), 282</ref>

== Influence and legacy ==
Hemingway's legacy to American literature is his style: writers who came after him emulated it or avoided it.<ref>Oliver (1999), 140<U+2013>141</ref> After his reputation was established with the publication of ''The Sun Also Rises'', he became the spokesperson for the post<U+2013>World War&nbsp;I generation, having established a style to follow.<ref name="Nagel 1996 87"/> His books were [[Nazi book burning|burned]] in Berlin in 1933, "as being a monument of modern decadence".

Irving also objected to the "offensive tough-guy posturing<U+2014>all those stiff-upper-lip, don't-say-much men" and contrasted Hemingway's approach to that of [[Herman Melville]], citing the latter's advice: 'Woe to him who seeks to please rather than appall.'"<ref name="NYT01">[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/10/books/review/john-irving-by-the-book.html?pagewanted=2 "John Irving: By the Book"], interview with the author, ''The New York Times'', June 7, 2012 (June 10, 2012 Sunday Book Review).

Benson believes the details of Hemingway's life have become a "prime vehicle for exploitation", resulting in a Hemingway industry.<ref>Benson (1989), 347</ref> Hemingway scholar Hallengren believes the "hard boiled style" and the machismo must be separated from the author himself.<ref name = "Hallengren"/> Benson agrees, describing him as introverted and private as [[J. D. Salinger]], although Hemingway masked his nature with braggadocio.<ref>Benson (1989), 349</ref> In fact, during World War&nbsp;II, Salinger met and corresponded with Hemingway, whom he acknowledged as an influence.  In a letter to Hemingway, Salinger claimed their talks "had given him his only hopeful minutes of the entire war" and jokingly "named himself national chairman of the Hemingway Fan Clubs."<ref>Baker (1969), 420</ref>

The [[International Imitation Hemingway Competition]] was created in 1977 to publicly acknowledge his influence and the comically misplaced efforts of lesser authors to imitate his style.
